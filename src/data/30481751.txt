    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies demonstrated the oncogenic
 roles of lncRNA UCA1 in osteosarcoma. This study aimed to explore the
 internal molecular mechanism of UCA1 on promoting osteosarcoma cell
 proliferation, migration and invasion. METHODS: qRT-PCR was conducted to
 measure the expression levels of UCA1, miR-182 and TIMP2. Cell transfection
 was used to change the expression levels of UCA1, miR-182 and TIMP2. Cell
 viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis were measured using CCK-8 assay,
 two-chamber migration (invasion) assay and Guava Nexin assay, respectively.
 The associations between UCA1, miR-182 and iASPP were analyzed by dual
 luciferase activity assay. The protein expression levels of key factors
 involved in cell apoptosis, PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta pathway and NF-kappaB pathway,
 as well as p53, Rb, RECQ family and iASPP were evaluated by western blotting.
 RESULTS: UCA1 was highly expressed in osteosarcoma MG63 and OS-732 cells.
 Knockdown of UCA1 inhibited OS-732 cell viability, migration and invasion,
 but promoted cell apoptosis. miR-182 was up-regulated in OS-732 cells after
 UCA1 knockdown and participated in the effects of UCA1 on OS-732 cells. TIMP2
 was downstream factor of miR-182 and involved in the regulatory roles of
 miR-182 on OS-732 cell viability, migration, invasion, apoptosis, as well as
 PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta and NF-kappaB pathways. UCA1 knockdown up-regulated p53, Rb
 and RECQL5 levels in OS-732 cells, while down-regulated the expression of
 iASPP. TGF-beta or TNF-alpha treatment could enhance the expression of UCA1
 in OS-732 cells. CONCLUSION: Our research verified that UCA1 exerted
 oncogenic roles in osteosarcoma cells by regulating miR-182 and TIMP2, as
 well as PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta and NF-kappaB pathways.",
