    abstract "BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a common lung disease in children with
 high fatality rate. Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is the main active component
 extracted from the roots of Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen (Araliaceae).
 Here, we carefully explored the potential anti-inflammatory and protective
 effects of NGR1 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung fibroblast MRC-5
 cell injury. METHODS: Viability and apoptosis of MRC-5 cells after different
 treatment or transfection were respectively assessed using CCK-8 assay and
 Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The expression levels of microRNA-132 (miR-132),
 IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in MRC-5 cells were measured using qRT-PCR.
 MicroRNA transfection was conducted to reduce the expression level of
 miR-132. Western blotting was used to analyze the protein expression levels
 of key factors involving in cell proliferation, apoptosis, NF-kappaB pathway
 and JNK pathway. RESULTS: LPS treatment caused MRC-5 cell proliferation
 inhibition, apoptosis and over-production of inflammatory cytokines. NGR1
 treatment had no significant effects on MRC-5 cell proliferation, apoptosis
 and production of inflammatory cytokines, but protected MRC-5 cells from
 LPS-caused cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis and over-production of
 inflammatory cytokines. In addition, NGR1 increased the expression level of
 miR-132 in MRC-5 cells. Knockdown of miR-132 reversed the protective effects
 of NGR1 on LPS-treated MRC-5 cells. Furthermore, NGR1 attenuated
 LPS-activated NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in MRC-5 cells via up-regulation of
 miR-132. CONCLUSION: This research confirmed the protective roles of NGR1 in
 lung fibroblast cell inflammatory injury. NGR1 protected MRC-5 cells from
 LPS-caused inflammatory injury through up-regulating miR-132 and then
 inactivating NF-kappaB and JNK pathways.",
