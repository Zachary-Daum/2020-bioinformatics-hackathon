    abstract "Kawasaki disease is an immune-mediated acute, systemic
 vasculitis and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in
 the developed world. Bifidobacterium (BIF) is one of the dominant bacteria in
 the intestines of humans and many mammals and is able to adjust the
 intestinal flora disorder. The Caco-2 cell monolayers were treated with tumor
 necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) at 10 ng/ml for 24 h to induce the
 destruction of intestinal mucosal barrier system. Cells viability was
 detected through Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was measured by
 flow cytometry and the expression of apoptosis related proteins was also
 detected through Western blot. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines
 interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 was detected through ELISA, Western blot and
 qRT-PCR, respectively. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay was
 conducted to value the barrier function of intestinal mucosa. Cell autophagy
 and NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways associated proteins were examined through
 Western blot. In the absence of TNF-alpha treatment, cell viability and
 apoptosis showed no significant change. TNF-alpha decreased cell viability
 and increased cell apoptosis and BIF treatment mitigated the
 TNF-alpha-induced change. Then, we found that BIF treatment effectively
 suppressed TNF-alpha-induced overexpression of IL-6 and IL-8. Besides, the
 results of TEER assay showed that barrier function of intestinal mucosa which
 was destroyed by TNF-alpha was effectively recovered by BIF treatment. In
 addition, TNF-alpha induced autophagy was also suppressed by BIF. Moreover,
 TNF-alpha activated NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways were also blocked
 by BIF, SN50 and SB203580. Our present study reveals that BIF plays a
 protective role in TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory response in Caco-2 cells
 through NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways.",
