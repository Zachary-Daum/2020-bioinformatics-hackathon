    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hypertension is a common public health problem
 due to its high morbidity and potential risk, which is related to
 inflammatory actions. Kaempferol (KAE) has anti-inflammation activities.
 Herein, we explored the effects of KAE on LPS-induced inflammatory injury in
 human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). METHODS: HAECs were treated with KAE
 before stimulated with LPS or AngII. After miR-203 inhibitor transfection,
 cell viability and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. The
 accumulated levels of apoptotic proteins, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)
 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways related proteins, MyD88
 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were both determined by western blot. The
 concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha
 (TNF-alpha) were detected by ELISA. Expression of miR-203 was analyzed by
 qRT-PCR. The target of miR-203 was achieved by luciferase assay. RESULTS: LPS
 successfully induced inflammatory injury as evidenced by decreasing cell
 viability, increasing apoptosis, and also increasing IL-6, TNF-alpha
 concentrations. The apoptotic proteins p53 and cleaved-Caspase-3 were both
 upregulated while Bcl-2 was downregulated. Moreover, LPS activated NF-kappaB
 and MAPK pathways. However KAE reversed the results led by LPS. KAE increased
 miR-203 expression in LPS or AngII-disposed HAECs. More experiments revealed
 that transfection with miR-203 inhibitor impaired the
 inflammation-alleviating effects of KAE. MyD88 and TLR4 were predicated as a
 target of miR-203, which might be implicated in the protective functions of
 KAE on HAECs. CONCLUSION: KAE exerted the protective impacts on HAECs against
 inflammatory injury through inactivation of NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways, as
 well as upregulation of miR-203.",
