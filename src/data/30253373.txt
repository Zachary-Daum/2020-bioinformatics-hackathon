    abstract "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
 deaths worldwide with unsatisfied prognosis. Kaempferol is a dietary
 flavonoid that inhibits tumorgenesis, and we aimed to uncover the underlying
 mechanism of kaempferol in lung cancer cells. METHODS: A549 cells were
 stimulated with kaempferol, and then cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy
 and expression of miR-340 were assessed. Subsequently, effects of kaempferol
 on protein expression of phosphatase with tensin homology (PTEN) and key
 kinases in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways were
 detected by Western blot analysis. Moreover, the effects of miR-340
 inhibition on kaempferol-induced alterations in A549 cells were also studied.
 RESULTS: Cell viability, proliferation and cyclinD1 expression level in A549
 cells were all reduced by kaempferol. Conversely, cell apoptosis and
 autophagy were promoted by kaempferol. We found autophagy promoted apoptosis
 in kaempferol-treated A549 cells. Then, expression of miR-340 was identified
 to be up-regulated by kaempferol treatment. After treatments with kaempferol,
 PTEN level was elevated and levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT were decreased.
 Moreover, the alterations induced by kaempferol were abrogated by miR-340
 inhibition. CONCLUSION: Kaempferol inhibited proliferation but induced
 apoptosis and autophagy in A549 cells. Additionally, kaempferol might
 function through up-regulating miR-340, along with up-regulation of PTEN and
 inactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.",
