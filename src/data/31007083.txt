    abstract "Osteosarcoma is a common malignant bone tumour in adolescents
 and old people, with highly invasive and metastatic features and poor
 prognosis. This study aimed to explore the role of miR-384 in osteosarcoma
 MG63 cells by targeting SLBP. Cell viability, migration and invasion,
 apoptosis, as well as apoptosis-related factors were evaluated by CCK-8
 assay, Transwell assay, flow cytometer and Western blotting, respectively.
 Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the target of miR-384.
 SLBP level was analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Important factors
 of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways were analyzed using Western
 blotting. We found that miR-384 was down-regulated in osteosarcoma tissue
 samples and cell lines (MG63, U2OS and OS732). miR-384 overexpression
 inhibited viability, migration and invasion, but promoted apoptosis of MG63
 cells; whereas, miR-384 silence exhibited the contrary effects on MG63 cells.
 SLBP was a target of miR-384. Knockdown of SLBP reversed the promoting effect
 of miR-384 silence on cells, indicating that miR-384 silence promoted growth
 and metastasis of MG63 cells by up-regulating SLBP. In conclusion, knocking
 down miR-384 promoted the growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma MG63 cells by
 up-regulating SLBP. To conclude, miR-384-SLBP may be a potential therapeutic
 target for osteosarcoma therapy.",
