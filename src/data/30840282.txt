    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Glioma is among the most aggressive of all human
 malignancies. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gastric carcinoma highly expressed
 transcript 1 (GHET1) was considered an important oncogene in tumors. However,
 the role of GHET1 in glioma was rarely studied. The present work aimed to
 explore the effect of GHET1 on glioma cell line U251. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
 The viability, migration and invasion of U251 cells were analyzed by Cell
 Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and transwell migration/invasion assay,
 respectively. The relative expression of GHET1 and miR-216a were detected by
 quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The expression of
 cell cycle-related proteins, cell metastasis-associated proteins and main
 factors in the JAK2/STAT3 and p53/survivin pathways was analyzed by Western
 blot. Cell transfection assay was conducted to alter expression of GHET1 and
 miR-216a in U251 cells. RESULTS: The viability, migration and invasion of
 U251 cells were promoted by GHET1 overexpression. The pro-cell cycle genes
 including Cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6, and the pro-metastasis genes including
 MMP-9 and Vimentin were up-regulated after GHET1 was overexpressed. MiR-216a
 was found to be down-regulated by GHET1 overexpression, and it was involved
 in the effects of GHET1 on U251 cells. GHET1 might promote U251 cells by
 down-regulating miR-216a. Finally, we found that GHET1 overexpression
 activated the JAK2/STAT3 and p53/survivin signaling pathways by
 down-regulating miR-216a. CONCLUSIONS: GHET1 overexpression increased
 viability, migration and invasion of U251 cells by down-regulating miR-216a.
 Mechanically, GHET1-miR-216a axis activated the JAK2/STAT3 and p53/survivin
 signaling pathways.",
