    abstract "Pneumonia is a lower respiratory disease caused by pathogens or
 other factors. This study aimed to explore the roles and mechanism of long
 noncoding RNA HAGLROS in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammatory
 injury in pneumonia. The HAGLROS expression in serum of patients with acute
 stage pneumonia was detected. To induce pulmonary injury, WI-38 human lung
 fibroblasts were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The HAGLROS
 expressions in LPS-treated WI-38cells and the effects of HAGLROS knockdown on
 the viability, apoptosis, and autophagy of LPS-induced cells were detected.
 Moreover, the regulatory relationship between HAGLROS and miR-100 was
 explored as well as the functional targets of miR-100 were identified.
 Furthermore, the regulatory relationship between miR-100 and
 PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB pathway was elucidated. LncRNA HAGLROS was higher
 expressed in serum of patients with acute stage pneumonia compared with that
 in serum of healthy control. LPS caused WI-38cell injury and increased
 HAGLROS levels. Downregulation of HAGLROS alleviated LPS-induced cell injury
 via increasing cell viability, and inhibiting apoptosis and autophagy.
 Moreover, there was a negative correlation between HAGLROS and miR-100, and
 the effects of HAGLROS downregulation on LPS-induced apoptosis and autophagy
 in WI-38cells were by regulation of miR-100. Furthermore, NFKappaB3 was
 verified as a functional target of miR-100 and effects of miR-100 inhibition
 on LPS-induced WI-38cell injury were alleviated by knockdown of NFKappaB3.
 Besides, Knockdown of HAGLROS inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB
 pathway. Our findings reveal that downregulation of HAGLROS may alleviate
 LPS-induced inflammatory injury in WI-38cells via modulating
 miR-100/NF-kappaB axis. HAGLROS/miR-100/NF-kappaB axis may provide a new
 strategy for treating acute stage of pneumonia.",
