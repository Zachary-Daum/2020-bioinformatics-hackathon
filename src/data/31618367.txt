    abstract "Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the malignant tumors with
 highly metastatic and aggressive biological actions. Schizandrin A (SchA) is
 a bioactive lignin compound with strong anti-oxidant and anti-aging
 properties, which is stable at room temperature and is often stored in a cool
 dry place. Hence, we investigated the effects of SchA on MM cell line A375
 and its underlying mechanism. A375 cells were used to construct an in vitro
 MM cell model. Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were
 detected by Cell Counting Kit-8, BrdU assay, flow cytometry, and transwell
 two-chamber assay, respectively. The cell cycle-related protein cyclin D1 and
 cell apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved-caspase-3, and
 cleaved-caspase-9) were analyzed by western blot. Alteration of H19
 expression was achieved by transfecting with pEX-H19. PI3K/AKT pathway was
 measured by detecting phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. SchA significantly
 decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, SchA
 inhibited cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression. SchA increased cell
 apoptosis along with the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins
 (cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9, and Bax) and the down-regulation of
 anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2). Besides, SchA decreased migration and
 down-regulated matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. SchA
 down-regulated lncRNA H19. Overexpression of H19 blockaded the inhibitory
 effects of SchA on A375 cells. SchA decreased the phosphorylation of PI3K and
 AKT while H19 overexpression promoted the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT.
 SchA inhibited A375 cell growth, migration, and the PI3K/AKT pathway through
 down-regulating H19.",
