    abstract "Proteinuria is one of the most important clinical features of
 nephrotic syndrome (NS). Injury of podocyte has been proved to contribute to
 the occurrence of proteinuria. This study explored the effects of geniposide
 (GEN) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-caused murine kidney podocyte MPC5
 apoptosis and autophagy. Viability and apoptosis of MPC5 cells were
 respectively detected with the help of CCK-8 assay and Guava Nexin assay.
 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) was used as an autophagy inhibitor, while rapamycin as
 autophagy activator. Si-Beclin-1 was transfected in MPC5 cells to
 down-regulate the expression of Beclin-1. We found that LPS stimulation
 significantly caused MPC5 cell viability reduction, apoptosis and autophagy
 (P < .05 or P < .01). GEN treatment remarkably alleviated the LPS-caused MPC5
 cell viability reduction and apoptosis, but promoted cell autophagy (P <
 .05). Moreover, 3-MA incubation or si-Beclin-1 transfection notably weakened
 the effects of GEN on LPS-caused MPC5 cell apoptosis and autophagy (P < .05),
 while rapamycin had opposite effects (P < .05). Furthermore, GEN activated
 Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in LPS-treated MPC5 cells (P < .05). In conclusion,
 this research verified the protective effects of GEN on podocytes damage. GEN
 alleviates LPS-caused apoptosis of murine kidney podocytes by activating
 Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK-mediated cell autophagy. Highlights: LPS causes podocyte MPC5
 apoptosis and autophagy. GEN alleviates LPS-caused MPC5 cell apoptosis, but
 promotes cell autophagy. 3-MA or si-Beclin-1 weakens the effects of GEN on
 LPS-treated MPC5 cells. Rapamycin strengthens the effects of GEN on
 LPS-treated MPC5 cells. GEN activates Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in LPS-treated
 MPC5 cells.",
