    abstract "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent kidney structural
 and functional disorder. Quercetin is one of active extracted flavonoids and
 has protective effects. Therefore, we proposed to survey the effect of
 Quercetin on CKD. HK-2 cells were preprocessed by Quercetin and then
 irritated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were
 utilized to test viability and apoptosis. ELISA assay was utilized to
 estimate the IL-6 and TNF-alpha secretion. Western blot was performed to
 examine the expression of apoptosis and inflammation-associated mediators.
 After that HK-2 cells were transfected by miR-124 inhibitor. And the
 above-mentioned parameters were reassessed. LPS stimulated apoptosis and
 declined viability in HK-2 cells. Additionally, LPS stimulated inflammatory
 responses. Meanwhile, Quercetin attenuated LPS-stimulated apoptosis,
 production of IL-6, and TNF-alpha in experimental cells. Subsequently, MyD88
 and miR-124 expression was elevated by LPS and alleviated by Quercetin.
 Finally, Quercetin exerted its protective function through NF-kappaB pathway
 via up-regulating miR-124. Our data demonstrated that Quercetin reduced
 apoptosis and inflammation stimulated by LPS in HK-2 cells. Moreover,
 Quercetin alleviated LPS-stimulated injury by up-regulating miR-124.",
