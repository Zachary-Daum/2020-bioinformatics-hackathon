    abstract "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurs when blood supply to
 the heart is diminished (ischemia) for long time, and ischemia is primarily
 caused due to hypoxia. This study evaluated the effects of long non-coding
 RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) on hypoxic rat cardiomyocyte-drived
 H9c2 cells. Hypoxic injury was confirmed by alterations of cell viability,
 migration, invasion, apoptosis, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha
 (HIF-1alpha) expression. MEG3 level in hypoxic cells and effects of its
 knockdown on hypoxic cells were assessed. The interactions between MEG3 and
 miR-183 as well as miR-183 and p27 were investigated. In addition, the
 effects of aberrantly expressed MEG3, miR-183, and p27 on hypoxic cells along
 with the activation of PI3K/AKT/FOXO3a signaling pathway were all assessed.
 Results showed that hypoxia induced decreases of cell viability, migration
 and invasion, and increases of apoptosis and expressions of HIF-1alpha and
 MEG3. Knockdown of MEG3 decreased hypoxia-induced injury in H9c2 cells.
 Knockdown of MEG3 also increased miR-183 expression, which was identified as
 a target of MEG3. The effects of MEG3 knockdown on the hypoxic cells were
 reversed by miR-183 silence. p27 was identified as a target gene of miR-183,
 and its expression negatively regulated by miR-183. The mechanistic studies
 revealed that knockdown of p27 decreased hypoxia-induced H9c2 cell injury by
 activating PI3K/AKT/FOXO3a signal pathways. These findings suggest that
 knockdown of MEG3 alleviates hypoxia-induced H9c2 cell injury by
 miR-183-mediated suppression of p27 through activation of PI3K/AKT/FOXO3a
 signaling pathway.",
