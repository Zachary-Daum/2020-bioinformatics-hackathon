    abstract "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating and common
 neurological disorder which causes local oxidative damage. The study aimed to
 investigate the underlying role of ANRIL in H2O2-induced cell injury of rat
 PC-12 cells. Cell injury was evaluated on the basis of cell viability,
 migration, invasion and apoptosis. The effect of ANRIL on H2O2-induced cell
 injury was estimated after cell transfection. Then, the interaction between
 ANRIL and miR-125a was explored by qRT-PCR and estimation of cell injury.
 Predicted by TargetScan, the possible target gene of miR-125a was verified.
 After that, the effects of aberrantly expressed target gene on cell
 viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis as well as phosphorylation of
 key kinases involved in JAK/STAT and ERK/MAPK pathways were evaluated.
 Results revealed that H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury could be aggravated by
 ANRIL suppression. ANRIL appeared to act as a sponge of miR-125a, and ANRIL
 suppression promoted H2O2-induced cell injury by up-regulation of miR-125a.
 MCL-1 was a target of miR-125a, and MCL-1 was negatively correlated with
 miR-125a. Subsequent experiments showed the effect of MCL-1 silence on
 H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury was the same as ANIRL suppression. MCL-1
 attenuated H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury by activating JAK/STAT and ERK/MAPK
 pathways. These findings suggested that knockdown of ANRIL aggravates
 H2O2-induced injury in PC-12 cells by targeting miR-125a. This might provide
 novel insights in the role of ANRIL in pathogenesis of oxidative damage
 during SCI.",
