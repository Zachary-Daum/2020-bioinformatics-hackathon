    abstract "Lidocaine (Lido) is a commonly used local anesthetic, which has
 been reported in various types of cells. However, the effects of Lido on lung
 cancer cells remain not understood. The study aimed to investigate the
 underlying mechanisms of Lido in the cisplatin resistance of A549/DDP cells.
 Different concentrations of cisplatin (0-320 microM) were used to stimulate
 A549 and A549/DDP cells, and cell viability and apoptosis were examined. To
 investigate the effect of Lido on A549/DDP cells, the optimum concentration
 of Lido was selected to treat A549/DDP cells, and cell viability, apoptosis,
 migration and invasion were then detected. The relative expression of miR-21
 in A549/DDP cells or in Lido-treated A549/DDP cells was analyzed by RT-qPCR.
 MiR-21 mimic, inhibitor and its control were transfected into A549/DDP cells
 to explore the regulatory effect of miR-21 on the cisplatin resistance in
 A549 or A549/DDP cells. The effects of miR-21 on PTEN/PI3K/AKT and PDCD4/JNK
 pathways were detected by western blot. The cisplatin resistance of A549/DDP
 cells was higher than that of A549 cells. Lido significantly suppressed cell
 viability, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell migration and invasion in
 A549/DDP cells. Additionally, miR-21 expression in A549/DDP was higher than
 that in A549 cells, and Lido significantly down-regulated miR-21 expression
 in A549/DDP cells. MmiR-21 inhibition exhibited the same effects as Lido on
 the cisplatin resistance of A549/DDP cells. Further, miR-21 suppression
 regulated PTEN/PI3K/AKT and PDCD4/JNK pathways in A549/DDP cells. These
 findings indicated that Lido alleviated the cytotoxicity resistance of
 A549/DDP cells via down-regulation of miR-21.",
