    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Currently, scientists attempt to improve
 outcome of spinal cord injury (SCI) via reducing secondary injury during SCI.
 Oxidative stress is critical for pathophysiology of secondary damage, thus we
 mainly focused on the anti-oxidant effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides
 (LBPs) on PC-12 and SH-SY5Y cells as well as the underlying mechanisms.
 METHODS: Oxidative stress was induced by H2O2 stimulation. Effects of LBPs on
 cell viability, apoptosis, and expression of proteins associated with
 apoptosis and autophagy in H2O2-induced cells were assessed by CCK-8 assay,
 flow cytometry assay and Western blot analysis, respectively. Then,
 expression of miR-194 was determined by qRT-PCR. Expression of miR-194 was
 dysregulated, and whether LBPs affected H2O2-treated cells through modulating
 miR-194 was verified. The expression of key kinases in the PI3K/AKT pathway
 and the intracellular levels of ROS and NO were testified by Western blot
 analysis and flow cytometry with fluorescent probes. RESULTS: H2O2-induced
 decrease of cell viability and increases of apoptosis and autophagy in PC-12
 cells were mitigated by LBPs treatment. Next, we found that miR-194
 expression was both down-regulated by LBPs treatment in PC-12 and SH-SY5Y
 cells. More experiments consolidated that influence of LBPs on H2O2-treated
 cells was reversed by miR-194 overexpression while was augmented by miR-194
 inhibition. LBPs elevated the phosphorylated levels of PI3K and AKT and
 reduced levels of ROS and NO through miR-194. CONCLUSION: LBPs alleviated
 H2O2-induced decrease of cell viability, and increase of apoptosis and
 autophagy through down-regulating miR-194. Moreover, LBPs activated the
 PI3K/AKT pathway and reduced oxidative stress through miR-194.",
