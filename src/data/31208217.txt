    abstract "Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia is a troublesome disease. Angelica
 polysaccharide (AP) is proved to have antioxidant effects. Our study was
 performed to confirm the effects of AP in hypoxia-exposed neural stem cells
 (NSCs). NSCs were pre-treated with AP and then stimulated with hypoxia.
 Viability of NSCs was examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay.
 Hypoxia-introduced apoptosis was observed by flow cytometry. Essential
 regulators of mTOR and Notch signalling pathways were examined by Western
 blot. mRNA expression was accessed using qRT-PCR. Bcl2/adenovirus EIB
 19kD-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) was altered by transfection. We noticed
 that NSCs were sensitive to hypoxia-induced apoptosis and showed decreased
 viability. Moreover, Beclin and light chain 3-II was upregulated while p62
 was downregulated. However, AP reversed all these results. Similarly, hypoxia
 decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K and Notch1 expression while
 AP increased the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K as well as the expression
 of Notch1. BNIP3 was upregulated by hypoxia while downregulated by AP.
 Further experiments demonstrated that overexpression of BNIP3 broken all the
 effects induced by AP shown in cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy and
 signalling pathways. Collectively, AP alleviated hypoxia-introduced NSCs
 damages by maintaining cell viability, blocking apoptosis and autophagy via
 downregulation of BNIP3 with the activation of mTOR and Notch signalling
 pathways.",
