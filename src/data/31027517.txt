    abstract "BACKGROUND: Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript
 1 (MALAT1) is a crucial mediator in response to inflammation. Myricetin
 protects cardiomyocytes against inflammatory injury. However, it's still
 unexplored whether myricetin exerted anti-inflammatory properties via MALAT1.
 The purpose of our study was to validate the cardio-protective function of
 myricetin against myocarditis and its underlying mechanism in vitro. METHODS:
 H9c2 cells were pre-incubated with myricetin before stimulation with
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Enforced silence of MALAT1 was achieved by
 transducing short hairpin (sh)-MALAT1 into H9c2 cells. Next, cell viability
 and apoptotic cells were detected with cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and
 Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide (Annexin V-FITC/PI)
 apoptosis detection kit, respectively. Western blot assay was conducted to
 examine apoptosis-relative proteins, pro-inflammatory factors, and signaling
 regulators. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to quantify
 pro-inflammatory factors and MALAT1 at mRNA levels. Enzyme-linked immune
 sorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to determine protein concentration of
 pro-inflammatory factors. RESULTS: Myricetin ameliorated LPS-elicited
 reduction of cell viability, augment of apoptosis, and overexpression of
 monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in H9c2
 cells. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of p65 and inhibitor of nuclear factor
 kappa B alpha (IkappaBalpha) were suppressed. Besides, myricetin enhanced the
 expression of MALAT1 which was originally down-regulated by LPS. However, the
 protective effects of myricetin against LPS-caused inflammatory lesions were
 abrogated in MALAT1-deficiency cells, with the restored phosphorylation of
 p65 and IkappaBalpha. CONCLUSION: Myricetin possessed an anti-inflammatory
 function against LPS-induced lesions in cardiomyocytes. Mechanically,
 myricetin up-regulated MALAT1, blocked LPS-evoked activation of nuclear
 factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inflammatory pathway, and, finally, exerted
 cardio-protective effects.",
