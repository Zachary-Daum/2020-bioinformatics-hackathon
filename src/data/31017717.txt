    abstract "BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a respiratory disease, which is
 triggered by pathogenic microorganisms or physical/chemical factors.
 Increasing evidence confirmed the vital impacts of long noncoding RNAs on
 various inflammatory diseases. Nonetheless, the influence of
 taurine-upregulated 1 (TUG1) in pneumonia remains vague. The research tried
 to disclose the protective impacts of TUG1 against lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS)-evoked injury in MRC-5 cells. METHODS: MRC-5 cells were disposed with
 LPS to construct pulmonary injury model. Then, pc-TUG1 vector was transfected
 into MRC-5 cells and the influence of overexpressed TUG1 in cell viability,
 apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-disposed cells were
 evaluated. The correlation between TUG1 and microRNA (miR)-127 was estimated
 via utilizing real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR),
 meanwhile whether miR-127 affected the impacts of TUG1 on LPS-injured MRC-5
 cells was explored. Besides, NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways were evaluated to
 understand the dormant mechanisms. RESULTS: LPS administration apparently
 evoked inflammatory injury in MRC-5 cells by restraining cell viability,
 accelerating apoptosis, and enhancing TNF-alpha and IL-6 productions. But,
 TUG1 lightened LPS-evoked pro-inflammatory response in MRC-5 cells. In
 addition, miR-127 was repressed by overexpressed TUG1, meanwhile the
 protective impacts of TUG1 against LPS-evoked inflammatory injury in MRC-5
 cells were overturned by overexpressed miR-127. Finally, we disclosed that
 TUG1 hindered the activation of NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways via
 restraining miR-127. CONCLUSIONS: These explorations testified that
 taurine-upregulated 1 (TUG1) protected MRC-5 cells against lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS)-evoked inflammatory injury via hindering miR-127/NF-kappaB/p38MAPK axis.",
