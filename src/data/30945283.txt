    abstract "AIM: To explore the protective effect of chemokine ligand 16
 (CXCL16) against cell damage induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in
 human microvascular endothelial cells-1 (HMEC-1) and its possible mechanism.
 METHODS: Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry were performed
 to determine cell viability and apoptosis of HMEC-1, respectively. qRT-PCR
 analysis was applied to display the expression of CXCL16 and miR-424. Western
 blot analysis was used to detect the expression of apoptosis-related
 proteins, CXCL16, cAMP/PKA/CREB, and PI3K-AKT-GSK3beta pathway-related
 proteins. RESULTS: OGD significantly inhibited cell viability and promoted
 apoptosis. CXCL16 overexpression decreased the proliferation inhibition and
 apoptosis of HMEC-1 induced by OGD. Furthermore, we found that CXCL16 was a
 target of miR-424 and was downregulated by miR-424. The further study showed
 that overexpression of miR-424 significantly increased proliferation
 inhibition and apoptosis of HMEC-1 induced by OGD. In addition, we also found
 that miR-424 was downregulated by PMS2L2. In the subsequence experiment,
 overexpression of PMS2L2 significantly decreased the proliferation inhibition
 and apoptosis of HMEC-1 induced by OGD, which suggested that PMS2L2 decreased
 cell damage of HMEC-1 induced by OGD. Simultaneously, CXCL16 treatment
 markedly increased the phosphorylation of PKA/CREB and PI3K-AKT-GSK3beta and
 these signal pathways were blocked by signal inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Our
 study first demonstrates that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced human
 microvascular endothelial cells-1 (HMEC-1) cell injury was alleviated by
 CXCL16 targeted by miR-424 which further targeted by PMS2L2. This process
 might also be regulated by activating PKA/CREB and PI3K-AKT-GSK3beta pathways.",
