    abstract "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a frequent chronic musculoskeletal
 disorder which lacks applicably effective therapeutic strategy. In this
 study, we attempted to investigate whether long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)
 cardiac hypertrophy-related factor (CHRF) participated in mediating
 interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced in vitro inflammatory damages as well as the
 regulatory mechanisms. ATDC5 cells were stimulated with IL-6, and then
 cellular damages were evaluated on the basis of cell viability by CCK-8,
 apoptotic cells by observation with flow cytometry, apoptosis-associated
 proteins by western blot analysis, and accumulation of inflammatory factors
 by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR),
 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and western blot analysis. Then,
 effects of lncRNA CHRF on IL-6-treated cells were evaluated. We further
 explored the downstream factor of lncRNA CHRF and demonstrated whether lncRNA
 CHRF functioned through the downstream factor. Afterwards, crucial signaling
 cascades were anatomized. We found that IL-6 reduced cell viability, elevated
 apoptosis, induced upregulation of inflammatory factors, as well as
 upregulated lncRNA CHRF and down-regulated miR-146a expression. Then, we
 found lncRNA CHRF overexpression aggravated IL-6-induced alterations, and
 lncRNA CHRF knockdown showed the opposite effects. Furthermore, miR-146a was
 identified to be negatively regulated by lncRNA CHRF, and its overexpression
 abrogated the roles of lncRNA CHRF in IL-6-treated cells. IL-6-induced the
 accumulation of IkappaBalpha, p65, JAK1, and STAT3 at phosphorylated level
 was further facilitated by lncRNA CHRF whereas repressed by miR-146a. In
 conclusion, lncRNA CHRF aggravated the IL-6-induced inflammatory damages in
 ATDC5 cells. We further outlined a possible mechanism that through
 downregulating miR-146a, lncRNA CHRF evoked the activation of NF-kappaB and
 JAK1/STAT3 signaling cascades.",
