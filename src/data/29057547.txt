    abstract "Gliomas are the most common types of primary central nervous
 system malignancy found in adults. Long non-coding RNA antisense non-coding
 RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) variants are associated with glioma and miR-34a
 is markedly downregulated in U251 glioma cells. The 3'-untranslated region (3
'UTR) of silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) contains a conserved site that
 is targeted directly by miR-34a. Therefore, in this study, we investigated
 the roles of ANRIL, miR-34a, and Sirt1 in glioma and their potential
 interactions. Firstly, expression of ANRIL in normal glia cells and five
 glioma cell lines was measured. Then, effects of ANRIL suppression on cell
 proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of U251 cells as well as
 expression of miR-34a were assessed. Meanwhile, effects of miR-34a on U251
 cells silencing ANRIL were tested. Whether Sirt1 is a target of miR-34a was
 verified, followed by estimating the role of Sirt1 overexpression in U251
 cells overexpressing miR-34a. Finally, the involved signaling pathways were
 assessed. ANRIL was upregulated in glioma cells and its suppression inhibited
 cell proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted cell apoptosis. ANRIL
 acted as a sponge of miR-34a, and Sirt1 is a target of miR-34a. Then, Sirt1
 was proved to function through activation of the PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling
 pathways. In conclusion, ANRIL was upregulated in glioma, and its inhibition
 could repress cell proliferation, migration and invasion but inhibit cell
 apoptosis through miR-34a-mediated downregulation of Sirt1, involving the
 inactivation of the PI3K/AKT and mTOR pathways.",
