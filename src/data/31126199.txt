    abstract "Background: Osteosarcoma is prevalent in children and
 adolescents. H1.4 modification is involved in various types of cancers. Ras
 pathway is often activated in human cancers. Herein, we explored the effects
 of Ras pathway through H1.4(S35ph). Methods: Osteosarcoma cancer cell line
 MG-63 was transfected with Ras gene with G12V and Y40C site mutation. The
 phosphorylation of H1.4(S35) and AKT was detected by Western blot. Cell
 viability, cell colonies and migration were analyzed by MTT assay, soft-agar
 colony formation assay and Transwell assay, respectively. The expression of
 Ras pathway downstream factors and PKA was detected by qRT-PCR. The
 relationship between Ras and downstream factors was detected by ChIP. The
 cell cycle progression was measured by flow cytometry. Results: Transfection
 with Ras(G12V/Y40C) decreased H1.4(S35ph) expression while switched on
 p-AKT(Ser473). Ras(G12V/Y40C) increased cell viability, colony numbers and
 migration while H1.4(S35E) (H1.4(S35ph) overexpression) led to the opposite
 results. The regulation of Ras(G12V/Y40C) and H1.4(S35E) on Ras downstream
 factors was contrary to each other. Results demonstrated a positive
 relationship between PKA with H1.4(S35ph) with Ras(G12V/Y40C) down-regulated
 both. However, PKA and MDM2 revealed negative regulation with Ras(G12V/Y40C)
 transfection up-regulated MDM2. Conclusion: Ras(G12V/Y40C)-PI3K/AKT signal
 pathway decreased H1.4(S35ph) through down-regulation of PKA while
 up-regulation of MDM2 in MG-63 cells. Highlights H1.4(S35ph) is regulated by
 K-Ras(G12V/Y40)-PI3K/AKT in MG-63 cells; Overexpression of H1.4(S35ph)
 regulates MG-63 cell growth; H1.4(S35ph) regulates Ras downstream factors;
 K-Ras(G12V/Y40C)-PI3K/AKT activity induces PKA degradation to down-regulate
 H1.4(S35ph); K-Ras(G12V/Y40C)-PI3K/AKT activity involves in PKA degradation
 via MDM2.",
