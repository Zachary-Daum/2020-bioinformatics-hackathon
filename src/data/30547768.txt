    abstract "BACKGROUND: Propofol, a commonly used intravenous anesthetic
 during cancer resection surgery, has been found to exhibit tumor inhibitory
 effects in vitro and in vivo. The role of propofol in lung cancer has been
 previously reported, whereas its action mechanism remains unclear. This study
 further investigated the effects of propofol on lung cancer A549 cell growth,
 migration and invasion, as well as the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Cell
 viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were assessed by
 CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay, two chamber transwell assay and flow cytometry,
 respectively. The regulatory effect of propofol on microRNA-372 (miR-372)
 expression in A549 cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Cell transfection was used
 to change the expression of miR-372. The protein expression of key factors
 involving in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, as well
 as Wnt/beta-catenin and mTOR pathways were analyzed by western blotting.
 RESULTS: Propofol inhibited lung cancer A549 cell viability, proliferation,
 migration, and invasion, but promoted cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-372 was
 down-regulated in propofol-treated A549 cells. Overexpression of miR-372
 abrogated the effects of propofol on proliferation, migration, invasion and
 apoptosis of A549 cells. Knockdown of miR-372 had opposite effects.
 Furthermore, propofol suppressed Wnt/beta-catenin and mTOR signaling pathways
 by down-regulating miR-372. CONCLUSION: Propofol inhibits growth, migration
 and invasion of lung cancer A549 cells at least in part by down-regulating
 miR-372 and then inactivating Wnt/beta-catenin and mTOR pathways.",
