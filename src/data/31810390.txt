    abstract "Background: Ras-PI3K pathway aberrant activation plays an
 important role in the occurrence and development of osteosarcoma. This study
 investigated the functions of Ras-PI3K pathway specific activation on histone
 H2A phosphorylation at threonine 120 (H2A(T120ph)) in osteosarcoma cells,
 along with the possible internal molecular mechanisms.Methods: Cell
 transfection was done to alter Ras(G12V/Y40C), H2A(T120ph) and
 vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) expression. Then, cell viability,
 proliferation, migration and cell cycle distribution were assessed,
 respectively. qRT-PCR was utilized to measure the VRK1 and Ras-PI3K pathway
 downstream genes (CYR61, IGFBP3, WNT16B, NT5E, GDF15 and CARD16) expression.
 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was conducted to evaluate the input
 levels of H2A(T120ph) and VRK1 in the promoter regions of Ras-PI3K pathway
 downstream genes.Results: Ras-PI3K specific activation promoted histone
 H2A(T120ph). H2A(T120ph) participated in the oncogenic functions of Ras-PI3K
 pathway on osteosarcoma by modulating the transcription of Ras-PI3K-targeted
 genes. Moreover, VRK1 contributed to the Ras-PI3K specific activation-induced
 up-regulation of H2A(T120ph) and osteosarcoma progression. Ras-PI3K
 pathway-specific activation-induced up-regulation of H2A(T120ph) was achieved
 by up-regulation of VRK1.Conclusions: Ras-PI3K pathway activation promoted
 osteosarcoma progression might be via up-regulating VRK1-mediated
 H2A(T120ph). We proposed that VRK1 and H2A(T120ph) could be the potential
 targets for osteosarcoma diagnosis and treatment.HighlightsH2A(T120ph) is
 specifically promoted by Ras-PI3K pathway activation.H2A(T120ph) joins in the
 oncogenic effects of Ras-PI3K pathway on osteosarcoma.H2A(T120ph) regulates
 the transcription of Ras-PI3K-targeted genes.VRK1 takes part in the
 regulatory function of Ras-PI3K pathway on H2A(T120ph).",
