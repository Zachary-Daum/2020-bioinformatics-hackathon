    abstract "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of miR-210
 abnormal expression on Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS)-treated primary human periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs). The miR-210
 level was identified in gingival tissues from patients with chronic
 periodontitis (CP) and healthy subjects as well as LPS-treated PDLCs by
 qRT-PCR. Cell viability, apoptotic cells, expression of proteins associated
 with apoptosis, and release of inflammatory factors in LPS-treated PDLCs were
 measured using MTT assay, flow cytometry assay, western blotting and ELISA,
 respectively. Effects of miR-210 abnormal expression on cell viability, cell
 apoptosis and inflammation factors in LPS-treated PDLCs were evaluated.
 Afterwards, the target gene of miR-210 was identified, and the involvement of
 p38MAPK/NF-kappaB pathway with the effects of miR-210 was finally studied.
 The miR-210 level was significantly down-regulated in gingival tissues from
 CP patients as well as LPS-treated PDLCs. LPS-induced decrease of cell
 viability, increase of apoptosis, and release of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6
 and IL-8 were attenuated by miR-210 overexpression. We found that
 hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-3alpha was a target of miR-210, and HIF-3alpha
 overexpression partly reversed the effects of miR-210 up-regulation on cell
 viability, cell apoptosis and inflammation factors expression in LPS-treated
 PDLCs. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of key kinases in the NF-kappaB
 and p38MAPK pathways were reduced by miR-210 via targeting HIF-3alpha in
 LPS-treated PDLCs. MiR-210 attenuated LPS-induced periodontitis, and the
 LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways was attenuated
 by miR-210 via targeting HIF-3alpha in PDLCs.",
