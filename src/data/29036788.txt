    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Colon cancer-associated transcript 2 (CCAT2), a novel
 lncRNA has been reported as an oncogene in several cancers. This study was
 aimed to explore whether CCAT2 also exerted oncogenic roles in endometrial
 cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of CCAT2 in 30 pairs of
 endometrial cancer and matched non-cancerous tissues were detected by
 qRT-PCR. Two endometrial cancer cell lines HEC-1-A and RL95-2 were used
 throughout this study. CCAT2 in cells was silenced by transfection with shRNA
 targeted CCAT2, then cell growth and metastasis were assessed by performing
 trypan blue staining, Transwell assay, and flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase
 reporter assay was used to detect the combination of miR-216b and CCAT2.
 Besides, the expression of miR-216b and Bcl-2 in cells were overexpressed or
 suppressed by transfection with their correspondingly mimic/vector or
 inhibitor/shRNA. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were performed to detect
 the expression of Bcl-2 and main factors in PTEN/PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling
 pathways. RESULTS: CCAT2 was highly expressed in endometrial cancer tissues
 when compared to non-cancerous endometrial tissues. Knockdown of CCAT2
 inhibited HEC-1-A and RL95-2 cells viability, migration, invasion, but
 induced apoptosis. CCAT2 was an endogenous sponge by competing for miR-216b,
 and miR-216b suppression alleviated CCAT2 silence-diminished cell growth and
 metastasis. miR-216b negatively regulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 could further
 active PTEN/PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude,
 these results demonstrated lncRNA CCAT2 was highly expressed in endometrial
 cancer tissues. Knockdown of CCAT2 inhibited cell growth and metastasis of
 endometrial cancer cells by sponging miR-216b.",
