    abstract "BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy in
 human endocrine system. This study aimed to investigate the effects of
 microRNA-625-3p (miR-625-3p) on thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration,
 invasion and apoptosis, as well as underlying potential mechanism. METHODS:
 The relative expressions of miR-625-3p in tumor tissues and adjacent normal
 tissues of 20 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) were assessed
 using qRT-PCR. Cell transfection was used to up-regulate or down-regulate the
 expressions of miR-625-3p in thyroid cancer SW579 and TPC-1 cells. Effects of
 miR-625-3p overexpression or suppression on SW579 and TPC-1 cell viability,
 migration, invasion and apoptosis were detected respectively. The regulatory
 effect of miR-625-3p on astrocyte elevated gene 1 (AEG-1) expression was also
 analyzed. Then, the roles of AEG-1 in SW579 and TPC-1 cell proliferation,
 migration, invasion and apoptosis, as well as Wnt/beta-catenin and c-Jun
 N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways activation, were evaluated. RESULTS:
 miR-625-3p had high expressions in tumor tissues, compared to adjacent normal
 tissues. Overexpression of miR-625-3p significantly promoted SW579 and TPC-1
 cell proliferation, migration and invasion but had no influence on cell
 apoptosis. Knockdown of miR-625-3p had opposite effects, but induced cell
 apoptosis. AEG-1 was up-regulated by miR-625-3p overexpression and
 participated in the effects of miR-625-3p on SW-579 and TPC-1 cells. In
 addition, overexpression of AEG-1 induced the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin
 and JNK pathways in SW579 and TPC-1 cells. CONCLUSION: miR-625-3p promoted
 proliferation, migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells by enhancing
 the expression of AEG-1 and activating downstream Wnt/beta-catenin and JNK
 pathways.",
