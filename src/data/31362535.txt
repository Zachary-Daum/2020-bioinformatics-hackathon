    abstract "The aberrant scar is a challenging problem. Baicalein has
 effects in attenuating hypertrophic scar formation. Herein, the roles of
 baicalein in NIH-3T3 were obtained. Cells were treated by baicalein. CCK-8
 method and western blot were used to detect cell viability and
 proliferation-related factors. Furthermore, collagen 1, collagen 3 and
 alpha-SMA expression were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. Besides,
 total soluble collagen was detected by Sircol assay. In addition, the levels
 of NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathways related factors were
 determined by western blot. The relationship between miR-9 and insulin-like
 growth factor (IGF)-1 were tested by luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and
 western blot. We found baicalein cell restrained proliferation and collagen
 production. Besides, baicalein increased expression of miR-9 and further
 experiments validated that transfection with miR-9 inhibitor reversed the
 results led by baicalein. Moreover, baicalein decreased the phosphorylation
 of pathway-related proteins while transfection with miR-9 inhibitor revised
 this result. Otherwise, IGF-1 was authenticated as a target of miR-9 and
 si-IGF-1 reversed the miR-9 inhibitor-induced change in cell proliferation
 and collagen production. In conclusion, baicalein restrained cell
 proliferation and collagen production by regulating miR-9/IGF-1 axis through
 NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathways. Highlights: Baicalein
 restrains NIH/3T3 cell proliferation and collagen production. Baicalein
 restrains NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathways. IGF-1 is a target
 of miR-9. Baicalein exerts its functions by regulating miR-9/IGF-1 axis.",
