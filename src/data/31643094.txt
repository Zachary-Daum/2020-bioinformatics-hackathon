    abstract "Kidney cancer (KC) seriously impacts public health. We detected
 the function and mechanism of circular RNA C3P1 (circC3P1) in KC cells.
 CCK-8, flow cytometry, migration, and invasion assay were respectively used
 to investigate the efficacies of circC3P1 and microRNA (miR)-21 on cell
 viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Phosphatase and tensin
 homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), circC3P1, and miR-21 expression
 were changed by cell transfection and detected by quantitative
 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, the
 apoptosis/pathways-related proteins and proteins were detected by western
 blot analysis. Besides, the relation between PTEN and miR-21 was detected by
 luciferase assay. circC3P1 and PTEN were downregulated while miR-21 was
 upregulated in KC tissues. circC3P1 declined cell viability, migration, and
 invasion and caused apoptosis. Furthermore, circC3P1 negatively regulated
 miR-21; miR-21 mimic could reverse the efficacies of circC3P1. Besides,
 circC3P1 restrained the PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways by downregulating
 miR-21. Finally, PTEN was authenticated as a target of miR-21. circC3P1
 restrained KC cell growth, migration, and invasion by regulating miR-21/PTEN
 axis and inactivating PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB signaling pathways.",
