    abstract "Icariin (ICA) is obtained from Epimedium brevicornu maxim and
 exploited to remedy miscellaneous cancers. But the role of ICA in
 medulloblastoma remains hazy. The research delved into the antitumor activity
 of ICA in medulloblastoma DAOY cells. ICA with diverse concentrations was
 utilized to stimulate DAOY cells, and the biological functions of ICA in
 medulloblastoma DAOY cells were examined. Then, the relative SPARC expression
 was determined in ICA-managed DAOY cells, and the pc-SPARC vector was
 transfected into DAOY cells to further probe the influence of SPARC and
 JAK1/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT pathways in ICA-managed DAOY cells. A xenograft model
 was established to investigate the function of ICA in vivo. ICA restrained
 cell viability, expedited apoptosis, prohibited cell migration and invasion,
 and meanwhile affected the associative factors expression in DAOY cells.
 Additionally, SPARC expression was declined in ICA-stimulated DAOY cells.
 Overexpressed SPARC reversed the functions of ICA in above-involved cell
 behaviors of DAYO cells and the correlative protein levels. Besides, ICA
 notably frustrated JAK1/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT activations in DAOY cells. Beyond
 that, ICA prohibited tumor formation in vivo. The results concluded that ICA
 exhibited the antitumor activity in DAOY cells via decreasing SPARC and
 inactivating JAK1/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT pathways.",
