    abstract "Osteosarcoma (OS) is a conversant malignant bone tumor, commonly
 occurs in children and adolescents. Nimotuzuma is an epidermal growth factor
 receptor (EGRF) monoclonal antibody agent, which has been exploited in varied
 solid tumors. Nevertheless, the functions of Nimotuzuma in OS remain blurry.
 We attempted to disclose the impacts of Nimotuzuma on OS cells proliferation
 and apoptosis. OS MG-63 and U2OS cells were stimulated with the disparate
 doses of Nimotuzuma. Then, cell viability, cell cycle, and apoptosis were
 appraised through executing CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays. Moreover, the
 change of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) was estimated via JC-1
 fluorescent probe to further probe the impacts of Nimotuzuma on cell
 apoptosis. The proteins of cell apoptosis, cell cycle, and EGFR/PI3K/AKT were
 appraised via western blot. Eventually, Nimotuzuma together EGRF or PI3K
 inhibitor (LY294002) were utilized to dispose MG-63 to further uncover the
 latent mechanism. We found that Nimotuzuma remarkably repressed cell
 viability at a time- and dose-dependent manners in MG-63 and U2OS cells. The
 percentage of the S phase cells was evidently reduced by Nimotuzuma through
 regulating P21, Cyclin E1, and Cyclin D1. In addition, Nimotuzuma obviously
 evoked cell apoptosis, meanwhile elevated Bid, Bax, and cleaved-caspase-3.
 Further exploration showed that Nimotuzuma decreased DeltaPsim in a
 dose-dependent manner in MG-63 and U2OS cells. Besides, we discovered the
 repressive functions of Nimotuzuma in OS cells proliferation and apoptosis
 via hindering the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway. These investigations testified that
 Nimotuzuma repressed cell growth by restraining the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway in
 OS cells, hinting the antitumor activity of Nimotuzuma in OS.",
