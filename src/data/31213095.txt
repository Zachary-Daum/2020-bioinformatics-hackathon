    abstract "Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is a traditional Chinese medicine with
 anti-inflammation and immunomodulatory effects. In this context, our purpose
 was to investigate the associated regulatory mechanisms of TMP against
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-caused pancreatic beta cell Min6 injury. The injury
 of Min6 cells was induced by 10 mug/mL of LPS. Viability of Min6 cells was
 detected through CCK-8 assay, apoptosis process through flow cytometry, and
 the proteins involved in apoptosis through western blot. Insulin secretion
 was valued through the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assay.
 microRNA-101 (miR-101) was measured through qRT-PCR. Mitogen-activated
 protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and signaling regulators was measured
 through western blot. We found that, TMP treatment effectively attenuated
 LPS-induced injury in Min6 cells by suppressing cell apoptosis and promoting
 insulin secretion. Further investigation revealed that TMP exerted protective
 effect through down-regulating miR-101, and MKP-1 was demonstrated as a
 target of miR-101. Moreover, TMP attenuated LPS-triggered inflammation by
 inactivating the JNK1/2 and NF-kappaB through the down-regulation of miR-101.
 In conclusion, our present study revealed that TMP alleviated LPS-induced
 injury in pancreatic beta-cell Min6 injury via regulation of miR-101/MKP-1
 with the bluntness of JNK1/2 and NF-kappaB pathways.",
