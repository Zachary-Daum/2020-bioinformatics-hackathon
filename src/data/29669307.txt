    abstract "This study aimed to explore the role of long non-coding RNA
 NEAT1 in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). The expression levels of
 NEAT1 in sepsis-induced AKI patients were detected. The rat mesangial cells
 (RMCs) were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cell injury.
 Then, the effects of NEAT1 suppression on the cell viability, apoptosis,
 cytokines expression, and oxidative stress in the LPS-stimulated RMCs were
 tested. The regulatory miRNA of NEAT1, as well as the target genes of this
 miRNA, were investigated. Moreover, the regulatory relationship between NEAT1
 and the NF-kappaB pathway was explored. The results demonstrated that NEAT1
 was significantly upregulated in the sepsis-induced AKI patients. Moreover,
 the upregulation of NEAT1 was associated with the serious degrees of AKI in
 sepsis patients. In addition, the suppression of NEAT1 alleviated LPS-induced
 injury in RMCs. MiR-204 was negatively regulated by NEAT1. Suppression of
 NEAT1 alleviated LPS-induced injury by overexpression of miR-204. Moreover,
 IL-6R was a target of miR-204, and the effects of the suppression of NEAT1 on
 LPS-induced cell injury were caused by inactivating the NF-kappaB pathway. In
 conclusion, upregulation of NEAT1 may aggravate the LPS-induced injury by
 targeting miR-204 and activating the NF-kappaB pathway. NEAT1 may serve as an
 important diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in sepsis-induced AKI.",
