    abstract "Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor of the skeletal system. The
 zinc finger transcription factor ZIC2 has been reported to be highly
 expressed in human cancers. The present study evaluated the effects of ZIC2
 and the possible underlying mechanisms in the human osteosarcoma cells. The
 expression levels of ZIC2 in human fetal osteoblastic cell line (hFOB1.19),
 osteosarcoma cell lines (U-2OS, SaoS2, and MG63), normal bone tissue, and
 osteosarcoma tumor were analyzed by Western blot, and real-time quantitative
 RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Osteosarcoma cells with either overexpressed ZIC2 or
 suppressed ZIC2 were analyzed to determine cell viability, colony formation,
 and cell invasion. The expressions of SHIP2 and PI3K/AKT signal
 pathway-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot and qRT-PCR. We first
 showed that ZIC2 is highly expressed in osteosarcoma cells and tissues. Then
 we demonstrated that overexpression of ZIC2 promoted viability, migration,
 and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, whereas suppression of ZIC2 showed
 opposite effects. Furthermore, SHIP2 expression was negatively regulated by
 ZIC2. Importantly, ZIC2 overexpression activated the PI3K/AKT signal pathway;
 however, overexpressed SHIP2 inhibited these effects. Lastly, we showed that
 activation of the PI3K/AKT signal pathway is essential for the effects of
 ZIC2 on osteosarcoma cells, as the effects of ZIC2 on the osteosarcoma cells
 were reversed by a PI3K/AKT inhibitor. Overall, ZIC2 is highly expressed in
 osteosarcoma cells and tissues, and its overexpression promotes viability,
 invasion of osteosarcoma cells via SHIP2 suppression, and PI3K/AKT
 activation. Thus, ZIC2 can be considered as a novel drug target for
 osteosarcoma management.",
