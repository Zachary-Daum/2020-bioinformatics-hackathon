    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acetylation of H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) has
 been well-characterized as an acetylated mark, and the expression of which is
 closely associated with the tumorigenesis of human cancers. This study aimed
 to reveal whether KRas mutation drives the initiation and progression of
 glioma via modulation of H4 acetylation. METHODS: Changes of H4K16
 acetylation in human glioblastoma A172 cells following transfection with a
 plasmid for expression of mutant KRas were tested by western blot analysis.
 MTT assay, transwell assay, soft-agar colony formation assay, RT-PCR and
 chromatin immunoprecipitation were carried out to evaluate the effect of
 H4K16ac on A172 cells growth and migration. Furthermore, the enzymes
 participating in the deacetylation of H4K16ac were studied by using RT-PCR
 and western blot analysis. RESULTS: H4K16ac was found to be deacetylated by
 KRas-ERK1/2 activation. H4K16Q (a plasmid for mimicking H4K16ac) repressed
 A172 cells viability, colony formation, and migratory capacity. Besides,
 H4K16ac was capable of regulating the transcription of several ERK1/2 pathway
 downstream genes. KRas-ERK1/2 signaling repressed H4 acetylation at K16 via
 modulation of a histone deacetylase Sirt2, as well as a histone
 acetyl-transferase TIP60. Moreover, KRas-ERK1/2 inhibited TIP60 via an
 MDM2-dependnet fashion. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that activation of
 KRas-ERK1/2 signaling participates in the onset and progression of glioma at
 least partially through modulating acetylation of H4 at K16. KRas-ERK1/2
 signaling mediates the acetylation of H4K16 via Sirt2 and MDM2-dependnet
 degeneration of TIP60.",
