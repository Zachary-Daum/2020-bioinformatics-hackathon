    abstract "Valvulopathy is a familiar heart disease, which fearfully harms
 the health of the body. We studied the effects and mechanism of long
 noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (lncMEG3) on MVICs cell in
 inflammatory damage. Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry were respectively
 used to detect the effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), MEG3
 and microRNA (miR)-101a on cell viability and apoptosis. Moreover, MEG3 and
 miR-101a expression were changed by cell transfection and investigated by
 reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore,
 Western blot was used to investigate the levels of Bax, pro-caspase-3,
 cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-9, interleukin (IL)-1beta,
 IL-6 and related-proteins of cell pathways. Otherwise, the levels of IL-1beta
 and IL-6 were also investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.
 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was examined by ROS assay. We found TNF-alpha
 caused inflammatory damage and upregulated MEG3. MEG3 was overexpressed and
 silenced in cells. Besides, MEG3 deteriorated inflammatory damage.
 Furthermore, MEG3 negatively regulated miR-101a and miR-101a mimic could
 reverse the effect of pc-MEG3. Besides, MEG3 enhanced the JNK and NF-kappaB
 pathways by downregulating miR-101a. In conclusion, MEG3 deteriorated cell
 inflammatory damage by downregulating miR-101a via JNK and NF-kappaB pathways.",
