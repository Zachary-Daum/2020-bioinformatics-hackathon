    abstract "Bronchopneumonia is a common multiple infection disease under 2
 years old. Luteolin is a natural flavonoid widely distributed in plants with
 anti-inflammatory effect. This study aimed to explore the effects of luteolin
 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bronchopneumonia injury in vitro and in
 vivo. Firstly, the viability and apoptosis of human bronchial epithelial
 BEAS-2B cells after luteolin treatment were assessed. Then, cells were
 treated with 10 muM LPS to simulate inflammatory injury. The potential
 protective effects of luteolin on LPS-induced BEAS-2B cell inflammatory
 injury were detected. Moreover, after LPS and/or luteolin treatment, the
 expression of microRNA-132 (miR-132) in BEAS-2B cells was measured. The roles
 of miR-132 in protective activity of luteolin were investigated. Finally, the
 LPS-induced bronchopneumonia murine model was established and the
 anti-inflammatory effects of luteolin in vivo were analyzed. The results
 showed that LPS decreased BEAS-2B cell viability, increased cell apoptosis
 and enhanced inflammatory cytokines expression. Luteolin alleviated the
 LPS-induced viability loss, apoptosis and elevated expression of inflammatory
 cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, luteolin alleviated the
 LPS-induced miR-132 expression increase in BEAS-2B cells. Overexpression of
 miR-132 reversed the protective effects of luteolin on LPS-induced
 inflammatory injury. Mechanistically, luteolin mitigated LPS-induced
 activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway by down-regulation of miR-132.
 Furthermore, we also found that luteolin alleviated LPS-induced
 bronchopneumonia model in vivo. In conclusion, this study revealed that
 luteolin alleviated LPS-induced bronchopneumonia injury in vitro and in vivo
 through down-regulating miR-132. These findings provide theoretical basis for
 deeply exploring the treatment of bronchopneumonia in children by using
 luteolin.",
