    abstract "Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported as oncogenes or
 tumor suppressors in many cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). However,
 the role and molecular mechanism of miR-3129 in GC is largely unknown. We
 aimed to explore the function and the underlying molecular mechanism of
 miR-3129 in GC. Cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues were
 collected from 50 patients with GC, and the expression of miR-3129 was
 detected by RT-qPCR. The expression of miR-3129 and pRb in human GC cell line
 SCG7091 was altered by transient transfection. Thereafter, MTT and flow
 cytometry assays were used to analyze cell viability and cell cycle. The
 expression of cyclin E, CDK2, CDK2 inhibitors (p16 and 21), and pRb were
 detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. A significant up-regulation of miR-3129
 was observed in GC tissues compared to adjacent tissues. Overexpression of
 miR-3129 significantly improved cell viability after 4 days of
 post-transfection. Flow cytometry assay results showed that the miR-3129
 overexpression arrested more SGC7901 cells at S phase. Moreover,
 overexpression of miR-3129 down-regulated the expression of CDK2 inhibitors
 while it up-regulated the expression levels of cyclin E, CDK2, and pRb.
 Interestingly, we found that pRb inhibition reversed the effect of miR-3129
 inhibitor on cell proliferation in SGC7901 cells, increased cell viability,
 reduced cells at G0/1 phase, and modulated the expression of
 proliferation-related factors. Our results revealed that miR-3129 functioned
 as an oncogene through positive regulation of pRb and may prove to be a
 promising option for molecular therapy of GC.",
