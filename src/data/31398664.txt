    abstract "BACKGROUND: Fracture healing is a complex process, and patients
 with fracture will undergo non-union or compromised regeneration. MicroRNA
 (miR)-342-5p is a Notch downstream molecule, and its roles in fracture
 healing remain unclear. We aimed to explore the functional roles of
 miR-342-5p in osteoblasts as well as the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The
 expression of miR-342-5p in differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells or hMSCs was
 examined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The effects of
 aberrantly expressed miR-342-5p on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration,
 and expressions of proteins associated with proliferation and osteogenic
 differentiation were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8, trypan blue staining,
 flow cytometry, Transwell assay, Western blot and qRT-PCR assays,
 respectively. The downstream factor and the target genes of miR-342-5p as
 well as the involvements of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
 (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway were finally
 assessed. RESULTS: miR-342-5p level was decreased during differentiation of
 MC3T3-E1 cells or hMSCs. After cell transfection, miR-342-5p overexpression
 significantly reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis, inhibited
 proliferation, migration and differentiation, and down-regulated Bmp7
 expression. Subsequent experiments showed the effects of miR-342-5p
 inhibition on MC3T3-E1 cells were abrogated by Bmp7 knockdown. Additionally,
 COL4A6 and Bmp2 were predicated as target genes of miR-342-5p. Finally,
 phosphorylated levels of MEK and ERK were increased by miR-342-5p inhibition
 via up-regulating Bmp7 expression. CONCLUSION: miR-342-5p inhibition promoted
 proliferation, migration and differentiation of osteoblasts via regulating
 Bmp7, along with activation of the MEK/ERK pathway.",
