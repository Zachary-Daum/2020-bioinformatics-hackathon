    abstract "Since DNA damage is a first incident occurred during a tumour
 attack, it is rational that histone H2A.X phosphorylation on tyrosine 39
 (H2A.X(Y39ph)) may act as a tumour-relevant factor. This study was aimed to
 test the authenticity of the hypothesis. Uveal melanoma MP65 cells were
 transfected for expression of KRas mutated. H2A.X phosphorylation and ERK1/2
 was measured, and transwell experiment was performed to examine the
 consequents of H2A.X(Y39ph) on MP65 cells developing and migration.
 Regulatory relationship between H2A.X(Y39ph) and ERK1/2 downstream genes were
 measured. Moreover, whether JMJD6 and MDM2 are involved in H2A.X
 phosphorylation was studied. Mutation of Ras activated ERK1/2 signalling and
 inhibited H2A.X phosphorylation at Y39. Silence of H2A.X(Y39ph) contributed
 to the regulation of MP65 cells growth, migration and transcription of ERK1/2
 downstream genes, including CYR61, IGFBP3, WNT16B, NT5E, GDF15 and CARD16.
 The repressed H2A.X phosphorylation through Ras-ERK1/2 signalling might be
 through MDM2-mediated JMJD6 degradation. Our study suggested that Ras-ERK1/2
 signalling inhibited H2A.X phosphorylation at Y39, which led to the
 uncontrolled developing and migration of uveal melanoma cells. In addition,
 H2A.X phosphorylation was mediated possibly through JMJD6 which could be
 degraded by MDM2.",
