    abstract "AIMS: The therapeutic strategies for diabetic retinopathy (DR)
 are disappointing. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) extracted from Panax ginseng can
 induce glucose uptake and lower oxidative stress. We aimed to explore the
 effect of Rg1 on DR using human retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19).
 MAIN METHODS: ARPE-19 cells were grown in high glucose (HG) to simulate DR.
 Cell viability, apoptosis, ROS generation and miR-26a level were examined by
 CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry assay, DCFH-DA staining and RT-qPCR,
 respectively. Expression of proteins associated with viability, apoptosis and
 oxidative stress was measured by Western blot analysis. Effects of Rg1 on
 HG-induced alteration were assessed. Moreover, whether miR-26a was involved
 in Rg1-associated modulation was verified. Finally, the involvements of the
 ERK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were analyzed by Western blot analysis. KEY
 FINDINGS: HG reduced cell viability while promoted apoptosis and oxidative
 stress in ARPE-19 cells. Rg1 ameliorated HG-induced cell injury. The
 expression of miR-26a was up-regulated by Rg1 in HG-treated cells, and
 miR-26a inhibition obviously reversed the effects of Rg1 on HG-treated cells.
 Finally, we found the ERK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were inhibited by Rg1
 through up-regulation of miR-26a. SIGNIFICANCE: Rg1 protected ARPE-19 cells
 against HG-induced injury through up-regulating miR-26a, along with
 inhibition of the ERK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Rg1 might be a potential
 therapeutic drug for DR.",
