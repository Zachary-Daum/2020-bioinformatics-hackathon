    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has been
 clarified to possess antibacterial, antiviral and other activities.
 MicroRNA-152 (miR-152) is a tumor suppressor, which has been testified to be
 involved in promoting osteogenic differentiation of marrow mesenchymal stem
 cells (MSCs). However, whether APS can affect BMSCs proliferation and
 osteogenic differentiation via mediating miR-152 remains uninvestigated.
 METHODS: After treatment with APS or transfection with pre-miR-152 and
 anti-miR-152, cell viability, cell proliferation-associated factors,
 differentiation of BMSCs-related genes, and the relative miR-152 expression
 was determined by CCK-8, Western blot and qRT-PCR assays. The relationship
 between miR-152 and BMP9 was assessed by qRT-PCR and dual luciferase activity
 assay. The effects of BMP9 on cell proliferation and osteogenic
 differentiation were determined in BMSCs after transfection with pEX-BMP9 and
 sh-BMP9. The key components in PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were
 analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: APS promoted proliferation and
 differentiation of BMSCs by increasing viable cells, up-regulating CyclinD1,
 down-regulating p21, and increasing expressions of Runx2, OCN, OPN, and
 Col-1. miR-152 was down-regulated by APS and miR-152 suppression exhibited
 the similar promoting effects on BMSCs, whereas miR-152 overexpression
 inhibited proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. BMP9 was a direct
 target of miR-152 and was involved in mediating the function of miR-152 in
 BMSCs. BMP9 up-regulation enhanced proliferation and differentiation of
 BMSCs. BMP9 was observed to activate PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways
 in BMSCs. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that APS promoted
 proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by down-regulating
 miR-152 and further up-regulating BMP9 and activating PI3K/AKT and
 Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.",
