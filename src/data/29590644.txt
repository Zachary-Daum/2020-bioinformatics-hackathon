    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: GATA4, a protein related to osteoblast
 differentiation and mineralization, whose acetylation is essential for
 cardiac defects. Here, we aimed to explore the functional impacts of GATA4
 acetylation on osteoporosis (OS). METHODS: GATA4 acetylation in hFOB1.19 and
 293T cells was detected after exposure of HDAC inhibitors (TSA and SAHA).
 Co-immunoprecipitation was conducted to determine which HATs and HDACs was
 involved in the modulation of GATA4 acetylation/deacetylation, and to
 identify the acetylation site. The transcriptional activity of GATA4 was
 measured in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. Furthermore, hFOB1.19
 cells viability and apoptosis were evaluated after transfection with
 acetylation-defective mutant of GATA4. RESULTS: As a result, GATA4
 acetylation was identified as a pivotal event in hFOB1.19 cells. GATA4 can be
 acetylated by P300/CBP, and the acetylation site was on lysine residue K313.
 Besides, the acetylation of GATA4 can be impaired by HDAC1, rather than by
 HDAC2-5. GATA4 acetylation contributed to the stability and transcription of
 GATA4. Moreover, GATA4 acetylation activated CCND2 transcription, and
 mutation of GATA4 on K-313 reduced cell viability and increased a
 mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in hFOB1.19 cells. CONCLUSION: Our data
 suggest that GATA4 exists as an acetylated protein in hFOB1.19 cells.
 Acetylation regulates the stability and transcription of GATA4, and activates
 CCND2 transcription, which may explain the growth-promoting functions of
 GATA4 in hFOB1.19 cells.",
