    abstract "Aims: microRNAs (miRNAs) occupy a vital position in diseases.
 This research aims to detect miR-103 influence on LPS-resulted HK-2 cells
 inflammation damage. Methods: Cells were exposed to LPS for inducing injury.
 CCK-8 and flow cytometry were introduced to detect cell viability and
 apoptosis rate, respectively. ELISA, qRT-PCR and western blot were
 respectively used to explore inflammation factors production and relative
 proteins expression. The relationship between miR-103 and c-Myc was analysed
 through luciferase reporter assay. Results: LPS led to significant inhibition
 of cell viability (p < .05) and proliferation-related proteins expression. It
 also increased the apoptosis rate (p < .05) and promoted inflammation
 cytokines overproduction (p < .001). Besides, miR-103 was elevated by LPS (p
 < .01), and aggravated LPS-induced damage above, while miR-103 inhibitor
 attenuated this impairment (p < .05, p < .01 or p < .001). However, c-Myc
 silence abolished miR-103 inhibitor protective effect on cell proliferation
 (p < .05), apoptosis (p < .01) and inflammation factors expression (p < .05
 or p < .01), representing a negative relationship between them. Besides, the
 activity of NF-kappaB as well as JAK/STAT pathways was controlled by miR-103,
 also, mediated through c-Myc. Conclusions: miR-103 mimic enhanced LPS-caused
 inflammation damage by silencing c-Myc in HK-2 cell line.",
