    abstract "The damage of vascular endothelial cells has become an
 indispensable factor in the occurrence and advancement of cardiovascular
 diseases. In the current study, we investigated the effect of Astragalus
 Polysacharin (APS) on H2O2-evoked oxidative injury in HUVECs. HUVECs cells
 were treated by H2O2 to induce oxidative damage. Cells viability, apoptosis
 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were detected through CCK8 assay and
 flow cytometry. The cell growth-related proteins and heme oxygenase-1(HO-1)
 and KLF2 expression were evaluated via Western blot assay. The functions of
 KLF2 in APS and H2O2 co-disposed HUVECs were explored after si-KLF2
 transfection. MEK/ERK pathway was finally measured through Western blot. We
 found that H2O2 stimulation-evoked HUVECs oxidative damage meanwhile impeded
 HO-1 expression. APS treatment effectively suppressed H2O2-induced oxidative
 injury in HUVECs. KLF2 and Nrf2 expression were elevated by APS and KLF2
 repression abolished the protective action of APS in H2O2-triggered cell
 injury. MEK/ERK pathway was activated by APS treatment. Furthermore, the
 MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor weakened the promoting effect of APS on the
 expression of KLF2. In conclusion, our study reveals that APS alleviates
 H2O2-triggered oxidative injury in HUVECs via elevating the expression of
 KLF2 via the MEK/ERK pathway.",
