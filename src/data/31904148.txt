    abstract "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a life-threatening cardiovascular
 disease, and the prognosis is far from satisfied. It is reported that the
 protective role of intermedin (IMD), a bioactive peptide, in cardiomyocytes.
 Nevertheless, its mechanism remains unclear. In vitro hypoxia cell model was
 established according to the alteration of cell survival. Cell counting
 kit-8, Western blot, and flow cytometry assay were used to test cell
 viability, proliferation and apoptosis. Then, the toxicity of IMD was
 analyzed, the functions of IMD on hypoxia-injury were explored. Reverse
 transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized
 for measurements of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1
 (MALAT1) expression in cells under hypoxia with or without IMD pretreatment.
 Whether IMD affected H9c2 cells through regulating MALAT1 was studied, and
 the possible involved signaling pathways were investigated. We found that
 hypoxia-caused decline of proliferation and the rise of apoptosis were
 remitted by IMD pretreatment. Hypoxia enhanced MALAT1 expression. MALAT1
 expression was upregulated by IMD pretreatment. It was proved that functions
 of IMD pretreatment in hypoxia-induced H9c2 cells could be reversed by MALAT1
 inhibition. Western blot analysis investigated IMD pretreatment elevated
 phosphorylated levels of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT as well
 as beta-catenin levels through upregulating MALAT1. It was the first time
 found that IMD pretreatment could effectively remit H9c2 cell hypoxia-caused
 injury via the upregulation of MALAT1and PI3K/AKT and beta-catenin pathways.",
