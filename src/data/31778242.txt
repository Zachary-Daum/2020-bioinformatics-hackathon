    abstract "Breast cancer is a common cancer and becomes a severe healthy
 problem among females. Ras-ERK pathway and H2B phosphorylation at serine 14
 (H2BS14ph) was involved in some cancers. Our research probed the feasible
 relationship between Ras-ERK1/2 and H2BS14ph in breast cancer cells and the
 underlying mechanism. MCF7 cells were transfected with Ras(G12V/T35S)
 plasmid, and H2BS14ph, ERK1/2, Mst1, and MDM2 expression were evaluated
 through executing western blot. MTT, soft-agar colony formation, flow
 cytometry, and Transwell assays were applied for delving the functions of
 H2BS14 in MCF7 cells behavior. ERK1/2 pathway downstream factors and Mst1
 expression was appraised via RT-PCR. The ChIP assay was utilized for
 detecting the relation between Ras and ERK1/2-downstream factors. We found
 that, Ras(G12V/T35S) inhibited H2BS14ph expression while upregulated
 phospher-ERK1/2. In addition, Ras(G12V/T35S) promoted MCF7 cell viability,
 colony numbers and migration, while H2BS14ph presented the opposite results.
 Transfection with Ras(G12V/T35S) and cotransfection with Ras(G12V/T35S) and
 H2BS14ph altered the expression of ERK1/2 downstream factors in an opposite
 direction. Additionally, Ras(G12V/T35S) -ERK1/2 triggered H2BS14ph repression
 was concerned with MDM2-adjusted Mst1 degradation. Conclusions,
 Ras(G12V/T35S) -ERK1/2 accelerated the development of breast cancer via
 mediating H2BS14ph by MDM2-modulated Mst1 degradation.",
