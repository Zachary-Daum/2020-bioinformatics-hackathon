    abstract "We planned to investigate the possible influences of long
 non-coding RNA (opioid growth factor receptor pseudogene 1) OGFRP1 in
 endometrial cancer and its potential regulatory mechanism. We measured the
 level of OGFRP1 in endometrial cancer tissues and evaluated the influences of
 OGFRP1 dysregulation on the tumour cell biological processes of endometrial
 cancer cells. Further, the regulatory relationships between OGFRP1 and
 miR-124-3p, between miR-124-3p and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) were, respectively,
 investigated. The interaction between OGFRP1 dysregulation and activation of
 PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway was revealed by Western blotting. OGFRP1 was
 up-regulated in endometrial cancer tissues and cells. OGFRP1 suppression
 inhibited the malignant behaviour (inhibited cell viability, promoted cell
 apoptosis, and suppressed cell migration and invasion) of the Ishikawa cells
 via negatively regulating miR-124-3p. SIRT1 was a target gene of miR-124-3p,
 and miR-124-3p regulated tumour growth and metastasis by the down-stream
 signal of SIRT1. Moreover, suppression of OGFRP1 restrained the activation of
 PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta signals in the Ishikawa cells via miR-124-3p/SIRT1 axis.
 Our experiments revealed that upregulation of OGFRP1 may enhance the
 progression of endometrial cancer by regulating miR-124-3p/SIRT1 axis and by
 activating PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway. OGFRP1 may be of significance in
 illustrating the biology of endometrial cancer.",
