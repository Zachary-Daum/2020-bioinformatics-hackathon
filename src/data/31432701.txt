    abstract "Circular antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (cANRIL)
 participated in inflammation of endothelial cells. However, whether cANRIL is
 associated with inflammatory injury of HK-2 cells, thereby affecting chronic
 kidney disease has not been investigated. We tested the hypothesis that
 cANRIL participated in inflammatory response in vitro. HK-2 cells were
 stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). RT-qPCR was executed for cANRIL
 expression assessment. After transfection, cell viability, apoptosis,
 inflammatory cytokines and ROS generation were appraised to evaluate the
 impact of silencing cANRIL on LPS-induced inflammatory injury. The regulatory
 relationship between cANRIL and microRNA-9 (miR-9) was verified. In addition,
 whether miR-9 affected LPS-induced inflammatory injury was measured after
 miR-9 inhibitor transfection. Western blot was utilized to detect NF-kappaB
 and JNK/p38 pathway-related proteins. The results showed that LPS promoted
 cANRIL expression and cell injuries in HK-2 cells. Furthermore, silencing
 cANRIL alleviated inflammatory injuries by promoting viability, suppressing
 apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines and ROS generation in HK-2 cells. In
 addition, miR-9 expression was accelerated by silencing cANRIL. Meanwhile,
 miR-9 down-regulation invalidated the effect of silencing cANRIL on
 inflammation and NF-kappaB and JNK/p38 pathways. The study clarified that
 silencing cANRIL hindered NF-kappaB and JNK/p38 pathways by positively
 regulating miR-9, thereby protecting HK-2 cells from LPS-induced injury.",
