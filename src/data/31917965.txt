    abstract "Luteolin has been reported to impede migration via repressing
 tumor-associated macrophage-secreted chemokine ligand 2 expression. However,
 it's still unexplored whether luteolin represses the metastasis progression
 of leukemia cells via regulating the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine
 receptor 4 (CXCR4). Jurkat cells were stimulated by lactacystin and
 chloroquine after luteolin preincubation. C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12
 (CXCL12) was applied to induce migration of Jurkat cells after the cells were
 pre-incubated with luteolin (50, 100, 150, and 200 muM). CXCR4 was quantified
 by Western blot assay. Next, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to detect
 cell viability. Apoptotic cells were observed with flow cytometry after
 staining. Migration assay was performed using a modified Boyden's chamber. We
 found that luteolin repressed CXCR4 expression at mRNA levels and restrained
 CXCL12-induced proliferation as well as migration. Furthermore, luteolin
 facilitated Jurkat cells apoptosis which was associated with the cleavage of
 caspase. Additionally, luteolin impeded the phosphorylated expression of
 PI3K, AKT, and ERK1 which was enhanced by CXCL12. In conclusion, luteolin
 exhibited anti-proliferation and anti-metastasis functions in CXCL12-treated
 Jurkat cells and inactivated PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways via
 repressing the transcription of CXCR4.",
