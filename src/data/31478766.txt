    abstract "Background: Myocardial ischemia is the main reason for ischemic
 heart disease. Baicalin is a plant-derived flavonoid with cardio-protective
 activity. Herein, we tested the influences of baicalin on cardiomyocytes H9c2
 apoptosis aroused by hypoxia stimulation. Methods: Firstly, H9c2 cells were
 subjected to hypoxia and/or baicalin exposure. Cell viability and apoptosis,
 along with hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) and Bcl-2/adenovirus
 E1B 19-KDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) expressions were tested
 respectively. Then, si-HIF1alpha was transfected into H9c2 cells to probe
 whether up-regulation of HIF1alpha attended to the influences of baicalin on
 hypoxia-stimulated H9c2 cells. Finally, the regulatory effect of nuclear
 factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway on
 HIF1alpha expression was analyzed. Results: Hypoxia exposure aroused H9c2
 cell viability reduction and apoptosis. Baicalin mitigated H9c2 cell
 viability reduction and apoptosis aroused by hypoxia. Moreover,
 HIF1alpha/BNIP3 pathway was further activated by baicalin in hypoxia-exposed
 H9c2 cells. Silencing HIF1alpha lowered the functions of baicalin on
 hypoxia-exposed H9c2 cells. Besides, baicalin enhanced hypoxia-caused
 activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway was
 associated with the up-regulation of HIF1alpha and protective functions of
 baicalin on hypoxia-exposed H9c2 cells. Conclusion: Baicalin relieved
 cardiomyocytes H9c2 apoptosis aroused by hypoxia might be achieved through
 activating Nrf2/HO-1-mediated HIF1alpha/BNIP3 pathway. Highlights Baicalin
 mitigates H9c2 cell viability loss and apoptosis aroused by hypoxia; Baicalin
 activates HIF1a/BNIP3 pathway in hypoxia-exposed H9c2 cells; Silencing
 HIF1alpha weakens the influences of baicalin on hypoxia-exposed H9c2 cells;
 Baicalin promotes Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in hypoxia-exposed H9c2 cells; Promotion
 of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is related to the up-regulation of HIF1alpha.",
