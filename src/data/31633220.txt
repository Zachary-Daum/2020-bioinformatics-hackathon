    abstract "The study was designed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of
 long noncoding RNA human metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript
 1 (MALAT1) in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-caused inflammation injury in human
 lung fibroblasts WI-38. WI-38 cells were stimulated with LPS to construct
 acute pneumonia cell model. MALAT1 in LPS-stimulated WI-38 cells was
 examined. LPS-induced inflammation injury was estimated using viability,
 apoptosis, and cytokine secretion including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and
 IL-6. Furthermore, the modulatory relations of MALAT1 and nuclear
 factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling were explored. We found that the
 sensitivity of WI-38 cells to apoptosis was enhanced by LPS-caused
 inflammation. Moreover, LPS promoted MALAT1 expression which was found to
 alleviate LPS-caused damages. Besides, NF-kappaB p65 overexpression resulted
 in an increased expression of MALAT1, and MALAT1 was identified as a target
 gene of p65. Furthermore, overexpression of MALAT1 reduced NF-kappaB
 activation. Pulldown assay showed that MALAT1 could directly interact with
 p65. Taken together, our findings revealed that MALAT1 was upregulated in
 LPS-stimulated WI-38 cells. Through directly interacting with p65, MALAT1
 blocked LPS-caused activation of NF-kappaB and repressed LPS-induced
 inflammation injury. MALAT1 may serve as a potential diagnostic indicator or
 therapeutic target for pneumonia.",
