    abstract "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a troublesome disease
 with high morbidity and mortality. Ginsenoside Rg3 possesses anti-cancer
 properties. Colon Cancer Associated Transcript 1 (CCAT1) participates in the
 genesis, development, invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer. In our
 study, we explored the effects of Rg3 on CRC cell line Caco-2 by regulating
 CCAT1. METHODS: CRC tissue was obtained from hospital and Caco-2 cells were
 purchased. Caco-2 cells were treated with Rg3 and/or transfected with pc-
 CCAT1 or pcDNA3.1. The group without Rg3 treatment was treated as control.
 Cell viability, cell apoptosis, cell migration and invasion were detected by
 Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry and Transwell chamber
 migration/invasion assay, respectively. The expression of CyclinD1, apoptosis
 related proteins (p53, Bcl-2, Bax, pro-/Cleaved-Caspase-3), migration and
 invasion related proteins (MMP-9 and vimentin), and phosphatidylinositol 3
'-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) related proteins (p/t-PI3K, p/t-AKT)
 were examined by western blot. The expression of CCAT1 was measured by
 quantitative real time RCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Rg3 significantly decreased
 cell viability, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. Meanwhile,
 the expression of Cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and vimentin
 was downregulated. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins p53, Bax, and
 Cleaved-Caspase-3 were upregulated while Bcl-2 was downregulated by the
 treatment of Rg3 compared with control. Furthermore, CCAT1 was upregulated in
 CRC tissue and Rg3 negatively regulated CCAT1 expression. Transfection with
 pc-CCAT1 led to the opposite results as compared with transfection with
 pcDNA3.1 in Rg3 treated cells. In addition, Rg3 decreased the phosphorylation
 of PI3K and AKT. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits migration and invasion,
 and promotes apoptosis of Caco-2 cells by suppression expression of LncRNA
 CCAT1.",
