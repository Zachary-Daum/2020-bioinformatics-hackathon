    abstract "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the commonest male
 urinary and reproductive system malignancies with high morbidity and
 mortality. circLMTK2 was reported as a tumor suppressor, therefore, we
 attempted to investigate the potential mechanism of circLMTK2 in PCa.
 METHODS: qRT-PCR was employed to examine the expressions of circLMTK2 and
 miR-183. Afterwards, cell transfection was conducted for overexpressing
 circLMTK2 and miR-183 in LNCaP and PC3 cells, and silencing circLMTK2 in
 RWPE1 cells. Then, CCK-8 assay, BrdU, transwell assay, flow cytometry and
 western blot were respectively conducted to examine the variations of cell
 growth and metastasis, as well as apoptosis. The expressions of key proteins
 involved in Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT pathways were further investigated
 utilizing western blot. RESULTS: circLMTK2 was lowly expressed in tumor
 tissues. circLMTK2 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation and
 metastasis, however promoted cell apoptosis in LNCaP and PC3 cells. circLMTK2
 knockdown enhanced cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion,
 while had no significant influences on apoptosis of RWPE1 cells. Further
 experiments verified that miR-183 up-regulation counteracted the influences
 triggered by circLMTK2 overexpression in LNCaP and PC3 cells. Besides, it
 markedly promoted the viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of
 LNCaP cells, however had no significant influence on cell apoptosis.
 Moreover, the inhibitory effects on Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT pathways
 evoked by circLMTK2 overexpression were diminished by miR-183 up-regulation
 in LNCaP and PC3 cells. CONCLUSION: These outcomes illustrated that circLMTK2
 overexpression exerts an anti-tumor effects through down-regulating the
 expression of miR-183.",
