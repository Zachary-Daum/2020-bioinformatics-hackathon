    abstract "Background: CircRNA circ_0026344 was previously revealed as a
 tumour-suppressive gene in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. The purpose
 of this research was to investigate the role of circ_0026344 in CRC cells
 metastasis induced by chemokines. Methods: Two human CRC cell lines SW480 and
 Caco-2 were treated by CCL20 and CXCL8. Cell proliferation,
 migration/invasion, expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
 inducers and the expression of circ_0026344 were measured using
 sulforhodamine B assay, Transwell chamber, western blot and qRT-PCR,
 respectively. The effects of circ_0026344 on CRC cells migration/invasion and
 the expression of EMT inducers were evaluated. Moreover, the downstream miRNA
 and signalling pathways of circ_0026344 were studied. Results: CCL20 and
 CXCL8 synergized to facilitate the proliferation, migration and invasion of
 CRC cells. At the meantime, E-cadherin was downregulated, whereas N-cadherin,
 Vimentin and Snail were up-regulated by CCL20 and CXCL8 co-stimulation, which
 was accompanied by the mobilization of PI3K/AKT/ERK signalling. More
 interestingly, the expression of circ_0026344 was down-regulated by CCL20 and
 CXCL8 co-stimulation. Silence of circ_0026344 increased the migratory and
 invasive capacities of CRC cells and increased EMT process as well.
 Overexpression of circ_0026344 led to a contrary impact. miR-183 was
 negatively regulated by circ_0026344, and the inhibitory effects of
 circ_0026344 overexpression on Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were reversed when
 miR-183 was overexpressed. Conclusion: Overexpression of circ_0026344
 restrained CRC metastasis and EMT induced by CCL20 and CXCL8 synergistical
 treatment. miR-183 was a downstream effector of circ_0026344, and the
 anti-tumour function of circ_0026344 might be involved in the repressed
 Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Highlights CCL20 and CXCL8 synergize to decrease
 the expression of circ_0026344; Silence of circ_0026344 promotes CRC cells
 migration, invasion and EMT process; miR-183 is a downstream effector of
 circ_0026344.",
