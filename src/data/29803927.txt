    abstract "Ultraviolet radiation b (UVB) is a common high-energy radiation
 which can lead to cell damage and even skin cancer. The mechanisms of lncRNAs
 in various diseases have attracted much attention of researchers. Herein, we
 investigated the effects and regulations of lncRNA highly up-regulated in
 liver cancer (HULC) on UVB-induced injury in HaCaT cells. The HaCaT cells
 were exposed to UVB at a wavelength of 280-320nm. Cell viability was detected
 at different times (0, 3, 6, 12 and 24h) after UVB treatment. Cells were
 transfected with sh-HULC, pc-HULC, sh-BNIP3 (Bcl-2 interacting protein 3) or
 pc-BNIP3, respectively. ZM 39,923 HCl was used as JAK/STAT(1/3) inhibitor.
 Cell viability and apoptosis were tested by trypan blue dye and flow
 cytometry analysis, respectively. The expression levels of autophagy-related
 factors were analyzed by Western blot assay. The expression changes of HULC
 and BNIP3 were measured by qRT-PCR. We found that UVB decreased cell
 viability, increased apoptosis and autophagy, and up-regulated the expression
 of HULC in HaCaT cells. Overexpression of HULC reduced cell viability,
 enhanced apoptosis and autophagy, and up-regulated BNIP3 expression by
 activating JAK/STAT(1/3) signaling pathway. Finally, BNIP3 suppression
 increased cell viability, reduced apoptosis and autophagy via the
 deactivation of mTOR signaling pathway. The results demonstrated that lncRNA
 HULC up-regulated BNIP3 and activated JAK/STAT(1/3) signaling pathway to
 accelerate UVB-induced cell damage in HaCaT cells. This study provides a
 possible target for the clinical treatment of UVB-induced keratinocyte injury.",
