    abstract "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are effector molecules that exert
 functions in cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the effects of circRNAs
 on myocardial ischemia remain uninvestigated. This paper aimed to explore the
 functions of circ_0010729 in oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD)-caused injury
 of human cardiomyocytes (HCM). HCM were exposed to OGD environment for 4 h.
 Then the expression of circ_0010729 was evaluated by RT-qPCR. After
 transfection, cell viability, apoptosis, and migration were examined to
 evaluate the impact of overexpression and knockdown of circ_0010729 on
 OGD-induced cell injury. The regulation between circ_0010729 and
 microRNA-145-5p (miR-145-5p) was verified. After miR-145-5p inhibitor
 transfection, whether aberrant miR-145-5p expression affected the modulation
 of circ_0010729 in OGD-induced cell injury was measured. Western blot was
 utilized to analyze mTOR and MEK/ERK pathway-related proteins. OGD treatment
 enhanced circ_0010729 expression and evoked cell injury in HCM. Moreover,
 OGD-induced injury was aggrandized by circ_0010729 overexpression via
 suppressing cell growth and migration in HCM. Knockdown of circ_0010729
 attenuated OGD-induced injury. In addition, circ_0010729 negatively regulated
 miR-145-5p expression. MiR-145-5p inhibition reversed the effects of
 silencing circ_0010729 on OGD-induced injury and mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways.
 We demonstrated that silencing circ_0010729 activated mTOR and MEK/ERK
 pathways by up-regulating miR-145-5p, thereby protecting HCM from OGD-induced
 injury.",
