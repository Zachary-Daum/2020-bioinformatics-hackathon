    abstract "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is an age-related disorder of
 bone-joint that causes pain and disability in middle and older people. This
 study aimed to investigate the potential effects of long non-coding RNA
 (lncRNA) THRIL on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced osteoarthritis cell injury
 model (ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury), as well as the possible internal
 molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed
 using CCK-8 assay and Guava Nexin assay, respectively. Cell transfection was
 conducted to change the expression of THRIL and microRNA-125b (miR-125b) in
 ATDC5 cells. qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of THRIL,
 miR-125b and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha and monocyte
 chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) in ATDC5 cells. ELISA was used to measure the
 concentrations of IL-6, TNF-alpha and MCP-1 in culture supernatant of ATDC5
 cells. Finally, the protein expression of key factors involved in cell
 apoptosis, inflammatory response, JAK1/STAT3 and NF-kappaB pathways were
 evaluated using western blotting. RESULTS: LPS significantly induced ATDC5
 cell inflammatory injury and up-regulated the expression of THRIL.
 Overexpression of THRIL aggravated the LPS-induced ATDC5 cell inflammatory
 injury. Suppression of THRIL had opposite effects. Moreover, THRIL negatively
 regulated the expression of miR-125b in ATDC5 cells. miR-125b participated in
 the effects of THRIL overexpression on LPS-induced ATDC5 cell inflammatory
 injury. Furthermore, overexpression of THRIL enhanced the LPS-induced
 JAK1/STAT3 and NF-kappaB pathways activation by down-regulating miR-125b.
 CONCLUSION: THRIL exerted pro-inflammatory roles in LPS-induced
 osteoarthritis cell injury model. Overexpression of THRIL promoted
 LPS-induced ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury by down-regulating miR-125b and
 then activating JAK1/STAT3 and NF-kappaB pathways.",
