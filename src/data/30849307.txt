    abstract "BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a common respiratory disease in
 pediatrics. Quercetin is a natural flavonoid widely distributed in many foods
 and drinks. Herein, we focused our investigation on the possible protective
 activity of quercetin in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-caused inflammatory damage
 of WI-38 lung fibroblasts. METHODS: Viability and apoptosis of WI-38 were
 respectively tested using CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. qRT-PCR
 was used to measure the expression levels of microRNA-221 (miR-221), IL-6 and
 TNF-a in WI-38. ELISA was conducted to determine the concentrations of IL-6
 and TNF-a in culture supernatant of WI-38. miR-221 mimic was transfected to
 increase miR-221 expression. The protein levels of key molecules involving in
 cell apoptosis, inflammation, NF-kappaB and JNK pathways were assessed using
 western blotting. RESULTS: LPS stimulation caused inflammatory damage of
 WI-38 lung fibroblasts via suppressing cell viability, inducing cell
 apoptosis and enhancing the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and
 TNF-a. Quercetin treatment mitigated the LPS-caused inflammatory damage of
 WI-38 lung fibroblasts via enhancing cell viability, inhibiting cell
 apoptosis and reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and
 TNF-a. Moreover, quercetin ameliorated LPS-caused up-regulation of miR-221 in
 WI-38. The effects of quercetin on LPS-caused inflammatory damage of WI-38
 were reversed by miR-221 overexpression. Furthermore, quercetin inactivated
 NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in LPS-treated WI-38 via down-regulation of
 miR-221. CONCLUSION: This research verified the protective effects of
 quercetin on lung fibroblasts inflammatory damage. We revealed that quercetin
 ameliorated LPS-caused inflammatory damage of WI-38 lung fibroblasts might be
 through down-regulation of miR-221 and inactivation of NF-kappaB and JNK
 pathways.",
