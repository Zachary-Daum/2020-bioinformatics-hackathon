    abstract "Nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), a vital long
 noncoding RNA (lncRNA), exhibits the functions in disparate cancers.
 Nevertheless, the influences of NEAT1 in congenital heart disease (CHD)
 remain unreported. The research delves into whether NEAT1 affects H9c2 cells
 apoptosis and autophagy under the hypoxia condition. Overexpressed NEAT1
 vector was transfected into H9c2 cells; then, functions of NEAT1 in cell
 viability, apoptosis, autophagy, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways were
 detected in H9c2 cells under hypoxia condition. Expression of NEAT1 and
 miR-181b in hypoxia and blood samples from CHD was evaluated. After miR-181b
 inhibitor transfection, functions of miR-181b repression in the
 above-mentioned cell behavior and PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways were
 reassessed. Overexpressed NEAT1 clearly allayed hypoxia-triggered H9c2 cells
 apoptosis and autophagy. The decreased NEAT1 and miR-181b were showcased in
 hypoxia and blood samples from CHD; meanwhile, elevated miR-181b evoked by
 overexpressed NEAT1 was observed in hypoxia-managed H9c2 cells. More
 importantly, miR-181b inhibition obviously overturned the influences of NEAT1
 in hypoxia-affected H9c2 cells apoptosis and autophagy. Besides,
 overexpressed NEAT1 facilitated PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 activations via
 enhancing miR-181b. The research exposed that NEAT1 eased hypoxia-triggered
 H9c2 cells apoptosis and autophagy by expediting PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3
 pathways via elevating miR-181b.",
