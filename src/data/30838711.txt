    abstract "Effects of ganoderic acid A (GAA), a lanostane triterpene, on
 hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy (HIE) remain unclear. We aimed to figure out
 the specific role of GAA in hypoxia-treated neural stem cells (NSCs) as well
 as the regulatory mechanisms. Primary rat NSCs were incubated under hypoxia
 to simulate HIE. Viability and apoptosis of hypoxia-injured NSCs were
 measured by cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively.
 Proteins related to apoptosis, autophagy, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways were
 evaluated by Western blot analysis. LY294002 and rapamycin were added to
 inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway and mTOR pathway, respectively. Enzyme-linked
 immunosorbent assay was carried out to test the release of proinflammatory
 cytokines. We found that hypoxia-induced decrease of cell viability,
 increases of apoptotic cells and autophagy, and the release of IL-6,
 IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha were all attenuated by GAA stimulation. Activation of
 caspases induced by hypoxia was alleviated by GAA. Furthermore, we found that
 inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway eliminated the effects of GAA on apoptosis
 and proinflammatory cytokines release in hypoxia-injured NSCs. Meanwhile,
 inhibition of the mTOR pathway abrogated the effects of GAA on cell autophagy
 in hypoxia-injured NSCs. In conclusion, GAA alleviated hypoxia-induced injury
 in NSCs might be through activating the PI3K/AKT and mTOR pathways.",
