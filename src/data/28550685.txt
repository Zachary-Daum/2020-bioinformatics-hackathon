    abstract "Breast cancer is a serious threat to women's physical and
 psychological health. Long noncoding RNA CAMTA1 (lncCAMTA1) was believed to
 be related with tumor progression, but its role in breast cancer is not
 clear. The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was used to investigate
 the effect of lncCAMTA1 on cell viability, migration/invasion, and apoptosis.
 The expression of lncCAMTA1, miR-20b, and VEGF in MDA-MB-231 were measured
 after corresponding transfections. Binding effects between lncCAMTA1 and
 miR-20b, miR-20b, and VEGF 3'-UTR were measured. The effects of miR-20b and
 VEGF on breast cancer cells were also assessed after transfections. The
 phosphorylation levels of the MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT3 pathways were determined
 to assess the effect of VEGF. The results showed that lncCAMTA1 expression
 promoted cell viability and migration/invasion, while knockdown of lncCAMTA1
 promoted cell apoptosis via binding with miR-20b. lncCAMTA1 negatively
 regulated miR-20b expression. VEGF was a target of miR-20b, leading to the
 modification of the phosphorylation levels of MAPK, ERK, JAK, STAT1, and
 STAT3. Our findings suggested that lncCAMTA1 might promote proliferation and
 mobility of human breast cancer cells via binding with miR-20b. VEGF was a
 direct target of miR-20b and regulated activation of the MAPK/ERK and
 JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. Therefore lncCAMTA1 has potential as a novel
 cancer diagnostic marker and as a putative novel therapeutic target for
 breast cancer treatment.",
