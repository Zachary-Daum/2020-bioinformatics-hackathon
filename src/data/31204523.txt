    abstract "The over-expanding role of lncRNA myocardial infarction
 associated transcript (MIAT) in various human diseases has been recently
 revealed. This study attempted to see the role of MIAT in a cell model of
 osteoarthritis (OA). ATDC5 cells were subjected to lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
 to mimic a cell model of OA. The effects of MIAT on the model were tested by
 performing CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, western blot and ELISA. The
 downstream miRNA and signalling pathways were studied by utilizing qRT-PCR
 and western blot. Transfection of ATDC5 cells with the shRNA specific against
 MIAT significantly attenuated LPS-evoked apoptosis and cytokines release. At
 the meantime, the viability loss and the cleavage of caspases were
 ameliorated as well. MIAT overexpressed lead to the opposite result. Further,
 miR-132 was found to be negatively regulated by MIAT. The protective effects
 of MIAT silence were flattened when miR-132 expression was suppressed.
 Besides that the inhibitory effects of MIAT silence on LPS-evoked NF-kappaB
 and JNK activation were eliminated by miR-132 silence. This study illustrated
 that silence of MIAT protected ATDC5 cells against LPS challenge. The
 chondroprotective effects of MIAT silence may be via up-regulation of miR-132
 and inhibition of NF-kappaB and JNK pathways.",
