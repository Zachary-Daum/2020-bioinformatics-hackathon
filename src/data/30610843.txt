    abstract "BACKGROUND: Acoustic neuroma is a benign and usually slow
 growing tumor. Brazilein is a natural compound extracted from hematoxylin.
 However, there has been no study of the mechanism of brazilein in acoustic
 neuroma cells. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanism of
 brazilein on human VS cells in this study. METHODS: The vestibular schwannoma
 (VS) cells were collected from patient tissues and used in this study.
 Different concentrations of brazilein (0, 10, 20 and 30muM) were used to
 treat VS cells. The expression of miR-133a was altered by transfection with
 miR-133a inhibitor. Further, cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, the mRNA
 and phosphorylation levels of cell cycle, apoptosis-related proteins and main
 factors in MAPK and JNK pathways were detected using CCK-8 assay, flow
 cytometry analysis, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS:
 The results showed that brazilein decreased cell viability, increased
 apoptosis and induced G1/G0 cell cycle arrest in VS Cells. Further, miR-133a
 expression was up-regulated in the brazilein-treated cells. Brazilein
 promoted apoptosis and induced G1/G0 cell cycle arrest via up-regulation of
 miR-133a. In addition, brazilein inhibited the activations of MAPK and JNK
 pathways by up-regulating miR-133a expression. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our
 study demonstrated that brazilein could induce apoptosis and G1/G0 phase cell
 cycle arrest, and deactivate MAPK and JNK signaling pathways via
 up-regulation of miR-133a in human VS cells. These results provide
 theoretical evidence for the clinical application of brazilein and a new
 strategy for the treatment of acoustic neuroma.",
