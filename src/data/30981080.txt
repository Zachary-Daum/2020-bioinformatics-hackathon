    abstract "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a familiar joint degenerative
 disease. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in the pathogenesis
 of OA. Nevertheless, the regulatory impacts of lncRNA highly up-regulated in
 liver cancer (lncRNA-HULC) on OA remain dimness. The study tried to probe the
 protective effect of HULC on ATDC5 cells against tumor necrosis factor-alpha
 (TNF-alpha)-induced inflammatory injury. METHODS: Relative expression levels
 of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1) and HULC in OA cartilage
 tissues and normal cartilage tissues were determined by RT-qPCR. TNF-alpha
 induced inflammatory injury model in ATDC5 cells was constructed, and the
 biological functions of HULC overexpression or suppression in
 TNF-alpha-injured ATDC5 cells were assessed. The relevancy between miR-101
 and HULC was investigated by utilizing bioinformatics prediction, luciferase
 reporter assay, RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation. MiR-101 mimic and
 inhibitor were transfected into ATDC5 cells, and its regulatory effect on
 TNF-alpha-injured ATDC5 cells was examined. Further, NF-kappaB and MAPK
 signaling pathways were finally detected by western blot. RESULTS:
 Enhancement of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 were observated in OA cartilage tissues,
 but repression of HULC was discovered in OA cartilage tissues. HULC
 expression was decreased by TNF-alpha treatment, and overexpressed HULC
 significantly relieved TNF-alpha-induced ATDC5 cells injury. Additionally,
 miR-101 was mutual repressed with HULC, and overexpressed miR-101 reversed
 the protective effect of HULC in TNF-alpha-injured ATDC5 cells. Besides, HULC
 blocked NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways via repression of miR-101. CONCLUSIONS:
 The discoveries testified that HULC protected ATDC5 cells against
 TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory injury by repression of miR-101.",
