    abstract "Kaempferol is a kind of bioflavonoid exerts diverse
 pharmacological activities, including anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory
 activities. Kaempferol has been recognized as an effective agent for
 alleviating the clinical symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA). This study aimed to
 provide evidence that Kaempferol has potential in the management of OA.
 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation induced a significant cell death and
 inflammatory injury in ATDC5 cells, as evidenced by the decreased cell
 viability, the induced apoptosis, the activated caspase-3, and the excessive
 production of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Precondition of cells with Kaempferol
 prevented apoptosis and the release of proinflammatory cytokines triggered by
 LPS. miR-146a was down-regulated by Kaempferol treatment, and Decorin was
 up-regulated by miR-146a overexpression. Consistently, both silence of
 miR-146a and Decorin exhibited Kaempferol-like effects towards ATDC5 cells
 stimulated by LPS. Moreover, Decorin silence activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR
 signaling pathway. In rat model of OA, the expression of miR-146a and Decorin
 in cartilage tissues was repressed by Kaempferol. Also, the activated
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in OA animal model was enhanced by Kaempferol
 administration. These data suggested that Kaempferol exerted potential
 anti-OA effects through down-regulation of miR-146a, and thus repressing the
 expression of Decorin.",
