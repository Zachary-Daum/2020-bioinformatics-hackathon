    abstract "Breast cancer is a common malignant tumor with a high incidence
 of recurrence and metastasis. It has been reported that propofol has certain
 anti-breast cancer effects, but the intrinsic molecular mechanism remains
 unclear. This study investigated the effect of propofol on breast cancer
 MCF-7 cells and its possible regulatory mechanisms. MCF-7 cells were treated
 by propofol, and then the effects of propofol on cell growth and
 epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were studied. We subsequently
 testified whether miR-21 was a downstream effector of propofol. As a result,
 propofol repressed the proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells, but
 significantly induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, miR-21 expression and EMT were
 inhibited by propofol stimulation. The effects of propofol on MCF-7 cells
 proliferation, apoptosis and EMT were all attenuated when miR-21 was
 overexpressed. Besides this, the activation of PI3K/AKT and
 Wnt3a/beta-catenin pathways was reduced by propofol stimulation in a
 miR-21-depedent manner. In conclusion, propofol can inhibit the proliferation
 and EMT of MCF-7 cells by down-regulating miR-21 expression. Moreover, miR-21
 can further regulate PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.",
