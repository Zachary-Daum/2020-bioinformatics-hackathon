    abstract "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the
 pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, especially in myocardial infarction
 and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). However, the underlying molecular mechanism
 remains unclear. In this study, we determined the role and the possible
 underlying molecular mechanism of lncRNA-ROR in myocardial I/R injury. H9c2
 cells and human cardiomyocytes (HCM) were subjected to either
 hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), I/R or normal conditions (normoxia). The
 expression levels of lncRNA-ROR were detected in serum of myocardial I/R
 injury patients, H9c2 cells, and HCM by qRT-PCR. Then, levels of lactate
 dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and
 glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were measured by kits. Cell viability,
 apoptosis, apoptosis-associated factors, and p38/MAPK pathway were examined
 by MTT, flow cytometry, and western blot assays. Furthermore, reactive oxygen
 species (ROS) production was determined by H2DCF-DA and MitoSOX Red probes
 with flow cytometry. NADPH oxidase activity and NOX2 protein levels were
 measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence and western blot. Results showed that
 lncRNA-ROR expression was increased in I/R patients and in H/R treatment of
 H9c2 cells and HCM. Moreover, lncRNA-ROR significantly promoted H/R-induced
 myocardial injury via stimulating release of LDH, MDA, SOD, and GSH-PX.
 Furthermore, lncRNA-ROR decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and
 regulated expression of apoptosis-associated factors. Additionally,
 lncRNA-ROR increased phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 expression and
 inhibition of p38/MAPK, and rescued lncRNA-ROR-induced cell injury in H9c2
 cells and HCM. ROS production, NADPH oxidase activity, and NOX2 protein
 levels were promoted by lncRNA-ROR. These data suggested that lncRNA-ROR
 acted as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury.",
