    abstract "Background: Colon cancer is the most frequently lethal cancer in
 digestive system. Herein, we tested the influences of UNC5B antisense lncRNA
 1 (UNC5B-AS1) on colon cancer cell growth and metastasis, along with the
 regulatory function of UNC5B-AS1 in microRNA-622 (miR-622)
 expression.Methods: Firstly, UNC5B-AS1 expression in colon cancer tissues and
 corresponding normal tissues were tested. Then, the influences of silencing
 UNC5B-AS1 by sh-UNC5B-AS1 transfection on colon cancer HCT116 and Caco-2 cell
 viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis, as well as
 miR-622 expression were assessed, respectively. Subsequently, whether miR-622
 attended to the influences of silencing UNC5B-AS1 on HCT116 and Caco-2 cells
 were probed. Finally, the activities of AMPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in cells
 were analysed.Results: UNC5B-AS1 had high expression level in colon cancer
 tissues. Silencing UNC5B-AS1 repressed HCT116 and Caco-2 cell proliferation,
 migration and invasion, but boosted cell apoptosis. Moreover, silencing
 UNC5B-AS1 raised miR-622 expression in HCT116 and Caco-2 cells. miR-622
 inhibitor transfection weakened the influences of silencing UNC5B-AS1 on
 HCT116 and Caco-2 cells. Besides, Silencing UNC5B-AS1 suppressed AMPK and
 PI3K/AKT pathways via raising miR-622.Conclusion: Silencing UNC5B-AS1
 repressed colon cancer growth and metastasis might be through raising miR-622
 expression and suppressing AMPK and PI3K/AKT pathways.",
