    abstract "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious threat for health and lives
 worldwide. Recently, lncRNA MEG3 has been well studied to participate in lung
 cancer, making us speculate that it may be essential for ALI. ALI was
 simulated by treatment of LPS in human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells and human
 PMVECs. Cell viability, migration, apoptosis and MEG3 level were assessed by
 CCK-8, Transwell, flow cytometry/Western blot and qRT-PCR assays,
 respectively. Utilizing bioinformatics methods, luciferase activity assay and
 assessments of cell viability, migration and apoptosis, the possible
 interacted microRNA were explored. We found that, LPS induced decreases of
 cell viability, migration and MEG3 expression but promoted cell apoptosis.
 MEG3 knockdown aggravated LPS-induced injury of WI-38 cells and PMVECs. MEG3
 acted as a sponge of miR-4262 and effects of MEG3 knockdown could be
 alleviated by miR-4262 inhibition. Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) was
 negatively regulated by miR-4262, and its overexpression ameliorated
 LPS-induced cell injury. LPS-induced alterations of key kinases in the
 PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways were reversed by KLF4 overexpression. In
 conclusion, MEG3 was down-regulated by LPS and its knockdown aggravated
 LPS-induced injury of human lung cells through miR-4262-mediated
 down-regulation of KLF4. The PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways were implicated.",
