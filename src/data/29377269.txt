    abstract "This study aimed to investigate the effects of ginsenoside Rh2
 on proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of the human medulloblastoma cell
 line Daoy, as well as to explore the potential mechanisms of the effects. The
 human medulloblastoma cell line Daoy was cultured in vitro and treated with
 or without ginsenoside Rh2. CCK-8 assay was performed to investigate the
 effect of Rh2 on cell survival using a cell counting Kit-8. Cell
 proliferation was assessed by BrdU assay. Cell apoptosis was determined using
 flow cytometry analysis. Cell migration was detected using a modified
 two-chamber migration assay. MiR-31 mimic and the NC control were transfected
 into Daoy cells and detected by qRT-PCR. The expression of Wnt3a, Wnt5a, and
 beta-catein was detected by Western blot analysis. Rh2 efficiently suppressed
 the proliferation and migration, and promoted the apoptosis of Daoy cells.
 Additionally, Rh2 could down-regulate miR-31. miR-31 overexpression reversed
 the effects of Rh2 on proliferation, apoptosis and migration of Daoy cells,
 and activated the Wnt/beta-catein signaling pathways in Daoy cells. Rh2 could
 inhibit the proliferation and migration, and induce apoptosis of Daoy
 medulloblastoma cells through down-regulation of miR-31 to inactivate the
 Wnt/beta-catein signaling pathway. Therefore, Rh2 may have a utility in
 clinical applications for the treatment of medulloblastoma.",
