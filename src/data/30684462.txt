    abstract "BACKGROUND: Triptolide (TPL) is the active component of
 Tripterygium wifordii Hook F, which has been reported to exert anti-tumor
 efficacies. Herein, we aimed to examine the efficacy of TPL in colorectal
 cancer (CRC) cells and to reveal its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Human
 CRC cell lines HT-29 and SW480 were treated by TPL for 24h in the presence or
 absence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer TGF-beta1. The
 expression of miR-191 in cell was overexpressed by miRNA transfection.
 Thereafter, cell viability, migration, apoptosis, EMT-related protein
 expressions, and the activation of NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways
 were respectively assessed. Moreover, a mouse model of CRC was established
 and the effects of TPL on the growth of primary tumors were tested. RESULTS:
 TPL (50 and 100nM) significantly reduced cell viability and migration, but
 increased apoptotic cell rate. TPL up-regulated Bax, increased the cleavage
 of caspase-3 and -9, and neutralized TGF-beta1-induced alterations of EMT
 indicators, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail. At the
 meantime, TPL treatment down-regulated miR-191 expression, and the effect of
 TPL on miR-191 expression was mediated by EZH2. More interestingly, anti-CRC
 properties and the inhibitory effects of TPL on NF-kappaB and
 Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were reversed by miR-191 up-regulation. In vivo
 data showed that, TPL treatment decreased the growth of primary tumor
 xenografts and the expression of miR-191. CONCLUSION: TPL is effective in
 killing CRC cells and suppressing the migratory capacity. TPL exerts anti-CRC
 properties possibly via down-regulating miR-191, and blocking the activation
 of NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.",
