    abstract "BACKGROUND: Scars affects the appearance and results in tissue
 damage. In this research, we preliminarily studied the function and mechanism
 of curcumin (CUR) on cell proliferation and soluble collagen synthesis in
 NIH-3T3 cells. METHODS: CCK-8 was used to detect the IC50 of CUR. Moreover,
 Western blot was used to measure the expression of cell
 proliferation-related, soluble collagen synthesis and pathway-related
 proteins. Sircol assay was determined the expression of soluble collagen.
 Furthermore, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to
 determined miR-29a, alpha-smooth muscle aorta (alpha-SMA), soluble collagen 1
 (Col 1) and Col 3 expression. RESULTS: CUR inhibited cell viability and
 proliferation-related proteins expression. Transforming growth factor-beta
 (TGFbeta1)-induced heightened the expression of proliferation-related
 proteins and soluble collagen synthesis-related proteins. CUR inhibited
 TGFbeta1-induced proliferation and soluble collagen synthesis. Furthermore,
 CUR positively related miR-29a and miR-29a mimic inhibited TGFbeta1-induced
 proliferation and soluble collagen synthesis. Besides, transfection with
 miR-29a inhibitor could partly reverse the effects of CUR. CUR inhibited the
 ERK1/2 and beta-catenin pathways and the miR-29a inhibitor reversed the above
 results. Otherwise, soluble collagen 1 (Col 1) partly reversed the effects of
 CUR on proliferation and soluble collagen synthesis and silenced Col 1/3
 could inhibit ERK1/2 and beta-catenin signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: CUR
 restrained TGFbeta1-induced proliferation and soluble collagen synthesis in
 NIH-3T3 cells by up-regulation of miR-29a via ERK1/2 and beta-catenin
 signaling pathways.",
