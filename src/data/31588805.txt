    abstract "Objective: This research was aimed to detect the functions of
 Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) on oxygen and glucose deprivation
 (OGD) injury and potential mechanisms at PC-12 cells. Methods: CCK-8, flow
 cytometry and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were used to detect OGD,
 LBPs and miR-24 effects on cell viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress.
 MiR-24 was transfected and texted by transfection and qRT-PCR. Moreover, the
 related-protein levels of apoptosis, autophagy and pathways were tested by
 Western blotting. Results: LBPs significantly enhanced cell viability ,
 inhibited cell apoptosis, autophagy and ROS level in OGD injury. In addition,
 miR-24 expression was declined in OGD-treated cells, while it was elevated
 when added LBPs. The preventive effects of LBPs on PC-12 cell damage induced
 by OGD were reversed by down-regulating miR-24. Furthermore, miR-24 inhibitor
 declined LBPs-induced change in Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK1/STAT3 pathways in
 OGD-injuried cells. Conclusions: LBPs exhibited preventive effects via
 up-regulating miR-122 and activating Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK1/STAT3 pathways
 in OGD-induced PC-12 cells.",
