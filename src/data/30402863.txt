    abstract "OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small single-stranded RNAs in
 eukaryotic cells, which play important regulatory roles in the pathogenesis
 of various diseases. We aimed to investigate the effects of miRNA-101
 (miR-101) on hypoxia-induced myocardial infarction (MI) cell injury model
 (myocardial H9c2 cell injury model). The possible target gene of miR-101 was
 also analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H9c2 cells were exposed to hypoxia
 treatment. Cell viability, migration, invasion, apoptosis and the expression
 of miR-101 were detected using CCK-8 assay, transwell assay, flow cytometer
 analysis, Western blotting and qRT-PCR, respectively. Then, the effects of
 miR-101 overexpression or suppression on the cell injury induced by hypoxia
 were assessed. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to analyze the
 possible target gene of miR-101. Finally, the effects of dimethyladenosine
 transferase 1 homolog (DIMT1), the possible target gene of miR-101, on H9c2
 cell injury were investigated. RESULTS: Hypoxia significantly induced H9c2
 cell injury. miR-101 was up-regulated after hypoxia induction.
 Hypoxia-induced cell injury was significantly reversed by miR-101 suppression
 and exacerbated by miR-101 overexpression. DIMT1 was a direct target gene of
 miR-101. Knockdown of DIMT1 markedly inhibited the protective effects of
 miR-101 suppression on hypoxia-induced cell injury by suppressing specific
 protein 1 (Sp1)/Survivin pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We verified the critical roles
 of miR-101 in regulating myocardial cell injury induced by hypoxia.
 DIMT1-mediated the Sp1/Survivin pathway was also involved in this process.
 Our findings replenished the understanding of the regulatory roles of miRNAs
 in hypoxia-induced MI cell injury and provided new molecular target for
 therapy and diagnosis of MI.",
