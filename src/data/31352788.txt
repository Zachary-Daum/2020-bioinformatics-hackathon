    abstract "Gastric cancer (GC) remains to be a familiar malignant tumor
 with poor prognosis and daunting impacts on global health. We planned to grab
 the latent impacts of microRNA-183 in regulating cell autophagy, thus to
 clarify its possible regulatory principle in GC. The miR-183 level in GC
 tissues and cell lines was investigated. The impacts of miR-183 dysregulation
 on cell biological performances including viability, apoptosis and autophagy
 of GC cell lines including SGC-7901 were detected. Also, cells were disposed
 with 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibition) before dysregulation of
 miR-183 to further investigate the correlation between cell autophagy and
 viability or apoptosis. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanisms between
 miR-183 and metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1),
 silent mating type information regulation 1 (SIRT1) or PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
 were explored. miR-183 was under-expressed both in GC tissues and in cell
 lines. miR-183 mimic alone depressed SGC-7901 cell viability and enhanced
 cell apoptosis and autophagy, whereas miR-183 inhibitor exhibited opposite
 effects. Moreover, the impacts of miR-183 on SGC-7901 cell viability and
 apoptosis were mediated by affecting the activation of autophagy. Our results
 indicate that miR-183 is under-expressed in GC cells and depression of
 miR-183 may enhance GC cell viability and inhibit cell apoptosis by affecting
 the activation of cell autophagy. MALAT1-miR-183-SIRT1 axis and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
 pathway may be mechanisms to mediate autophagy in GC. miR-183 may serve as a
 towardly therapeutic target for GC.",
