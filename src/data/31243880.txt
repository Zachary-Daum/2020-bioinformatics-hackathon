    abstract "Gastric carcinoma (GC) is a pernicious neoplasm with high
 morbidity and mortality. Sinomenine (SIN) has long been exploited to heal
 rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, SIN has been discovered to exert the
 antitumour functions in diverse cancers. However, the impacts of SIN on GC
 remain indistinct. We attempted to expose the antitumour effect of SIN on GC.
 MKN45 and SGC-7901 cells were administered with SIN for 24 hours, cell
 viability, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and the associated
 proteins in the above processes were examined via exploiting CCK-8, BrdU,
 flow cytometry, Transwell and Western blot. MiR-204 expression in GC tumour
 tissues, different GC cell lines and SIN-stimulated GC cells was investigated
 by executing RT-qPCR. The above cell biological processes were reassessed
 after transfection with miR-204 inhibitor. The latent mechanisms were probed
 by examining AMPK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. We found that SIN memorably
 repressed cell proliferation, evoked apoptosis and affected CyclinD1, Bcl-2,
 Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 expression in MKN45 and SGC-7901 cells. Cell
 migration, invasion and expression of MMP-9 and Vimentin were all restrained
 by SIN stimulation. The increase of miR-204 was discovered in GC tissues and
 SIN-treated MKN45 and SGC-7901 cells. But suppression of miR-204 was observed
 in AGS, MKN28, MKN45 and SGC-7901 cells. Suppression of miR-204 overturned
 the inhibitory functions of SIN in MKN45 and SGC-7901 cells. Besides, SIN
 prohibited AMPK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways via enhancement of miR-204. In
 conclusion, these findings suggested that SIN exerted the antitumour activity
 in GC cells by hindering AMPK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways via enhancement
 of miR-204.",
