    abstract "Polydatin (PD), a monocrystalline polyphenolic drug mainly found
 in the roots of Polygonum cuspidatum, has various pharmacological activities.
 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 5
 (DGCR5) was found to participate in the suppression of multiple cancers.
 Here, we proposed to study the effect of PD on myocardial infarction (MI) by
 inducing DGCR5. CCK-8 assay was performed to detect the viability of H9c2
 cells. Flow cytometry was utilized to test apoptosis of H9c2 cells. These
 results determined the optimal concentration and effect time of hypoxia as
 well as PD. Si-DGCR5 was transfected into cells and the expression level was
 determined by qRT-PCR. Western blot was utilized to evaluate the expression
 of apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved-caspase-3, as well as
 autophagy-associated proteins including Beclin-1, p62, and LC3-II/LC3-I. As a
 result, PD efficiently attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis and autophagy in
 H9c2 cells. The expression of DGCR5 was down-regulated by hypoxia and
 up-regulated by PD. Besides, knocking-down the expression of DGCR5 inhibited
 the protection of PD in H9c2 cells. In addition, PD up-regulated the
 accumulation of DGCR5, DGCR5 decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and p62,
 raised the expression of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3, and the proportion of
 LC3-II/LC3-I. PD stimulated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK signaling pathways
 via up-regulating the expression of DGCR5. Our data demonstrated that PD
 reduced cell apoptosis and autophagy induced by hypoxia in cardiomyocytes.
 Moreover, PD activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK signaling pathways by
 up-regulating the expression of DGCR5.",
