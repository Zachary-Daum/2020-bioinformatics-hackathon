    abstract "This study aims to evaluate the effect of the regulatory
 relationship between microRNA-383 (miR-383) and PARP2 in the cell migration
 and invasion in human with cervical cancer (CC) via the PI3K-AKT-MTOR
 signaling pathway. Cancerous tissues and corresponding paracancerous tissues
 were collected from 115 patients with CC. The positive expression rate of
 PARP2 was detected by immunohistochemistry. HeLa cells with highest miR-383
 expression were selected and assigned into the blank, negative control (NC),
 miR-383 mimic, miR-383 inhibitor, si-PARP2, and miR-383 inhibitor + si-PARP2
 groups. qRT-PCR and Western blot were performed to evaluate the expression of
 miR-383, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, PARP2, and p70S6K. MTT assay were utilized to
 measure cell viability. Transwell assay were applied to evaluate cell
 invasion and metastasis. Dual luciferase reporter assay identified that PARP2
 is a target gene of miR-383. Cancerous tissues manifested higher expression
 of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, PARP2, and p70S6K but lower miR-383 expression than
 paracancerous tissues. Compared with the blank and NC groups, the miR-383
 mimic and si-PARP2 groups had decreased expression of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, PARP2,
 and p70S6K mRNA and protein. In the miR-383 mimic and si-PARP2 groups, the
 cell viability, migration, and invasion were descended, in comparison to the
 blank and NC groups. All above parameters showed an opposite trend in the
 miR-383 inhibitor group when compared with the blank and NC groups. This
 study demonstrates that miR-383 could down-regulate PARP2 to protect against
 CC by inhibiting PI3K-AKT-MTOR signaling pathway.",
