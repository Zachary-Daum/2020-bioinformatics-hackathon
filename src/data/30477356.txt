    abstract "Liver cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers in
 human digestive system, which kills more than half a million people every
 year worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the effects of kaempferol, a
 flavonoid compound isolated from vegetables and fruits, on hepatic cancer
 HepG2 cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, as well as
 microRNA-21 (miR-21) expression. Cell viability was detected using cell
 counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell proliferation was measured using 5-bromo-2
'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed using
 Guava Nexin assay. Cell migration and invasion were determined using
 two-chamber migration (invasion) assay. Cell transfection was used to change
 the expression of miR-21. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
 reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to analyze the expressions of miR-21 and
 phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN). Expression of key proteins involved
 in proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and phosphatidylinositol
 3-kinase/protein kinase 3/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR)
 pathway were evaluated using western blotting. Results showed that kaempferol
 significantly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion,
 and induced cell apoptosis. Kaempferol remarkably reduce the expression of
 miR-21 in HepG2 cells. Overexpression of miR-21 obviously reversed the
 effects of kaempferol on HepG2 cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and
 apoptosis. Moreover, miR-21 negatively regulated the expression of PTEN in
 HepG2 cells. Kaempferol enhanced the expression of PTEN and inactivated
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, kaempferol
 inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 cells by
 down-regulating miR-21 and up-regulating PTEN, as well as inactivating
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",
