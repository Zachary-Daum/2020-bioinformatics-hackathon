    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive
 malignant tumors, with increasing incidence, poor prognosis, and lack of any
 effective targeted therapies. Abnormal expression of miR-29a has been found
 in several types of cancers, including melanoma. In this study, experiments
 were performed to investigate the role of miR-29a in melanoma, and the
 molecular mechanism by which miR-29a represses melanoma. METHODS: miR-29 and
 Bmi1 expression was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
 reaction (qRT-PCR). The cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion
 were respectively determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Propidium iodide
 (PI) fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-Annexin V staining assay, wound healing
 assay and transwell assay. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to
 determine a target gene of miR-29a. Western blot was used to analyze protein
 expression of apoptosis-related proteins, Bmi1, Wnt/beta-catenin and Nuclear
 factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway target genes. RESULTS: miR-29a was
 down-regulated in all tested melanoma cell lines. Up-regulation of miR-29a
 effectively inhibited cell viability, migration, and invasion, but promoted
 apoptosis in A375 cells. Bmi1 was a direct target gene of miR-29a.
 Transfection with miR-29a mimic decreased cell migration and invasion and
 Bmi1 expression in Malme-3M cells, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-5, and M14 cell lines.
 Moreover, miR-29a might suppress growth, migration and invasion of A375 cells
 by negatively regulating Bmi1. In addition, our results demonstrated that
 transfection with miR-29a mimic effectively blocked Wnt/beta-catenin and
 NF-kappaB pathways via down-regulating Bmi1. CONCLUSION: miR-29a could be
 functioned as a potential tumor suppressor through direct regulation of Bmi1
 in melanoma cells.",
