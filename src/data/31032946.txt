    abstract "It has been reported that Ras-ERK signaling regulated tumor
 suppressive genes via epigenetic mechanisms. Herein, we set out to
 investigate the correlation between K-Ras-ERK1/2 signaling and H1.2
 phosphorylation, to provide a better understanding of K-Ras-ERK signaling in
 cancer. A plasmid for expression of mutated K-Ras was transfected into human
 bladder carcinoma HT1197 cells. Western blot was carried out for testing the
 expression changes of ERK1/2 and H1.2. The
 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay,
 soft-agar colony formation assay, and transwell assay were used to test the
 effects of H1.2 phosphorylation at T146 (H1.2 (T146ph) ) on HT1197 cells
 growth and migration. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
 reaction (qRT-PCR) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed to
 test whether H1.2 (T146ph) regulated K-Ras-ERK1/2 downstream genes.
 Furthermore, how K-Ras-ERK1/2 regulated H1.2 (T146ph) expression was studied.
 We found that the ERK1/2 was activated when K-Ras was mutated, and H1.2
 (T146ph) expression was significantly downregulated by K-Ras mutation. H1.2
 (T146E) for mimicking H1.2 (T146ph) significantly attenuated K-Ras mutation
 induced increases in HT1197 cells viability, colony formation, and relative
 migration. Besides, H1.2 (T146ph) regulated the transcription of K-Ras-ERK1/2
 downstream genes, including NT5E, GDF15, CARD16, CYR61, IGFBP3, and WNT16B.
 Furthermore, K-Ras-ERK1/2 signaling inhibited H1.2 phosphorylation at T146
 through degradation of DNA-PK, and the degraded DNA-PK by K-Ras-ERK1/2
 possibly via modulation of MDM2. In conclusion, the activation of
 K-Ras-ERK1/2 signaling will repress the phosphorylation of H1.2 at T146, and
 thereby, promoted the growth and migration of bladder cancer cells.
 K-Ras-ERK1/2 signaling repressed H1.2 phosphorylation possibly by
 MDM2-mediated degradation of DNA-PK.",
