    abstract "Circular RNA (circRNA) cZNF292 has been previously revealed as a
 circular oncogenic RNA. This study attempted to illustrate the functions of
 cZNF292 in human esophageal carcinoma Eca-109 cells. Eca-109 cells were
 transfected with the short hairpin RNA specific against cZNF292 (sh-cZNF292)
 and/or miR-206 inhibitor. cZNF292 and miR-206 expression was examined by
 quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell
 counting kit-8 and flow cytometry were performed for detecting cell growth
 including cell viability as well as apoptosis. Various kinds of factors,
 which are involved in cell development including proliferation, apoptosis,
 migration, and invasion were determined by western blot analysis. Besides,
 the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PI3K/AKT signaling
 was measured by western blot analysis. It was found that cZNF292 silencing
 decreased Eca-109 cell viability and induced apoptosis. In the meantime,
 cZNF292 silencing inhibited cell migration and invasion. cZNF292 silencing
 upregulated miR-206 expression. And miR-206 downregulation impaired the
 suppressive effects of cZNF292 silence toward Eca-109 cell growth, migration,
 and invasion. cZNF292 silencing activated AMPK signaling and inactivated
 PI3K/AKT signaling also via regulating miR-206. In conclusion, silencing of
 cZNF292 abated growth, migration, and invasion of Eca-109 cells by
 upregulating miR-206, which subsequently modulated AMPK and PI3K/AKT
 signaling pathways.",
