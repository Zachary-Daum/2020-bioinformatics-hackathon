    abstract "Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is the main active ingredient of
 astragalus and exhibits various pharmacological effects. This study aimed to
 investigate the effect of APS on hypoxia-induced injury in neural stem cells
 (NSCs). The NSCs derived from the hippocampus of rat were subjected to
 hypoxia incubator to establish a hypoxia model. NSCs were pretreated with APS
 before hypoxia injury to investigate the effect of APS. The expression of
 miR-138 was inhibited by transfection with miR-138 inhibitor and the miR-138
 level was measured by qRT-PCR. Cell viability and apoptotic cell rates were
 respectively assessed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry assay. Western blot
 was performed to determine the expression of apoptosis-, JNK pathway- and
 p38MAPK pathway-related factors. Hypoxia exposure caused the reduction of
 cell viability and induction of cell apoptosis of NSCs. However, APS
 pretreatment attenuated the cell injury induced by hypoxia, as evidenced by
 increased cell viability, reduced apoptotic cells, inhibited expression of
 pro-apoptotic factors and enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic factor.
 Interestingly, higher miR-138 expression was observed in the hypoxia-injured
 NSCs compared with normoxia, and miR-138 expression was further up-regulated
 by APS pretreatment. Furthermore, miR-138 inhibitor blocked the protective
 effect of APS on hypoxia-injured NSCs. In addition, we found that APS
 inhibited the JNK and p38MAPK pathways through miR-138. In conclusion, this
 study demonstrated a protective effect of APS on hypoxia-induced NSC injury.
 The regulatory mechanism might be mediated by up-regulation of miR-138 and
 inhibition of the JNK and p38MAPK pathways.",
