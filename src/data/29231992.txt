    abstract "BACKGROUND: 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (HCFU), also known
 as carmofur, is an effective chemotherapeutic agent applied to several
 cancers. This study was aimed to explore the functional effects of HCFU on
 cervical cancer cells and tried to uncover its possible mechanism. METHODS:
 Two immortalized cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and Caski) and primary
 cervical cancer cells prepared from two cervical cancer patients were used in
 this study. Cell viability, apoptosis, colony formation, migration, invasion,
 and the expressions of cell growth- and metastasis-associated factors were
 respectively assessed following 0-1 microg/mL of HCFU treatment for 0-48 h.
 Besides, the expressions of main factors in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
 pathway were detected following HCFU administration. RESULTS: As a result,
 HCFU significantly suppressed HeLa and Caski cells viability but promoted
 apoptosis, both in time- and dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).
 Besides, HCFU reduced these two cell lines colony formation capacity,
 migration and invasion (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). In primary cervical
 cancer cells, cell viability was reduced (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), the
 expressions of Cyclin D1, MMP2 and MMP9 were down-regulated, while the
 expression of E-Cadherin was up-regulated after HCFU treatment. Further, HCFU
 down-regulated the expressions of intranuclear beta-catenin, c-Myc, and
 TCF-1, but has no impacts on intracytoplasmic beta-catenin expression in HeLa
 cells and primary cervical cancer cells. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated
 an anti-growth and anti-metastasis role of HCFU in cervical cancer cells.
 HCFU suppressed cervical cancer possibly via blocking Wnt/beta-catenin
 signaling pathway. This article is protected by copyright. All rights
