    abstract "This study aimed to investigate the effect and underlying
 mechanism of long non-coding RNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1)
 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation injury in HK-2 cells. We
 established LPS-induced septic acute kidney injury (AKI) model in HK-2 cells.
 LPS-induced HK-2 cells were transfected with pc-PVT1, pc-NC, si-PVT1 or
 si-NC. Cell viability and apoptosis rate were detected by MTT assay and
 Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection kit, respectively. The relationships of
 PVT1 and inflammatory factors were evaluated by RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP)
 assay. The levels of inflammatory factors, apoptosis-related proteins and the
 expressions of proteins related to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear
 factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway were detected by ELISA or Western
 blotting. Compared with cells with pc-NC, cell viability was remarkably
 decreased and cell apoptosis rate was increased in LPS-induced cells with
 pc-PVT1 (p<0.05). The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),
 interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1beta were significantly increased in LPS-induced
 cells with pc-PVT1 compared with cells with pc-NC (p<0.05). All these changes
 were reversed in LPS-induced cells with si-PVT1 and si-NC (p<0.05). RTP assay
 revealed that PVT1 could bind to TNF-alpha. Furthermore, down-regulated PVT1
 remarkably reduced the expressions of p-JNK and p-c-Jun, p-IkappaBalpha and
 p-p65 (p<0.05); while increased expressions of these proteins and
 inflammatory factors induced by up-regulated PVT1 were reversed by JNK or
 NF-kappaB inhibitors. PVT1 may promote inflammatory response by binding to
 TNF-alpha and inhibiting JNK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in LPS-induced
 septic AKI cells.",
