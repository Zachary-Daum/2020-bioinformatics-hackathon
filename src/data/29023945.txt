    abstract "MicroRNA-29 (miR-29) family is involved in various types of
 cancer regulation. Although miR-29 family was shown to play an inhibitory
 role in tumorigenesis, the effect of miR-29a expression on schwannoma cells
 still remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of miR-29
 family in schwannoma. The expressions of miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c were
 detected in the Schwann tissues and cell lines using qRT-PCR. The effect of
 miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c on cell viability, migration, invasion, and
 apoptosis was tested. Then, the regulatory relationship between miR-29a and
 CKD6 was detected using qRT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase assay. Finally,
 the phosphorylation levels of mainly factors in JNK and p38MAPK/ERK pathways
 were analyzed by Western blot. The expression of miR-29a, miR-29b, and
 miR-29c was downregulated in Schwann tissues and cell lines. Cell viability,
 migration, invasion were decreased, while apoptosis was increased when
 miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c overexpression. We further found that miR-29a
 negatively regulated expression of CDK6. Then, knockdown of miR-29a promoted
 cell viability, migration, invasion, and inhibited apoptosis in schwannoma
 cells by upregulating CDK6 expression. In addition, the overexpression of
 miR-29a downregulated CDK6 expression by deactivation of JNK and p38MAPK/ERK
 pathways. Our data suggested that miR-29a could play an important role in
 inhibiting proliferation and motility of cancerous Schwann cells, and may
 suppress tumor growth through upregulation of CDK6.",
