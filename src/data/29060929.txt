    abstract "BACKGROUND: Despite advancement in the treatment, the mortality
 of gastric cancer remains high. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumor
 development and progression by regulating signaling pathways. In this study,
 we investigated the role of miR-937 in gastric cancer cells. METHODS: MiR-937
 expression was determined in gastric cancer and matched normal tissues, and
 human gastric cancer cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
 Effects of miR-937 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were
 analyzed by MTT and Transwell assays, respectively. In addition, the
 regulation of FOXL2 by miR-937 was evaluated by western blotting and
 luciferase reporter assays. Effects of FOXL2 on cell proliferation, migration
 and invasion were detected again. RESULTS: MiR-937 level was low expressed in
 gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-937 inhibited
 cell viability, colony formation and promoted apoptosis in gastric cancer
 cells. MiR-937 overexpression also inhibited cell migration and invasion by
 inhibiting the EMT process. Furthermore, we found that FOXL2 was a direct
 target of miR-937 and negatively regulated by miR-937. Moreover, miR-937
 overexpression inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Furthermore,
 we found that overexpression of FOXL2 promoted cell viability, colony
 formation, migration, invasion, and inhibited apoptosis in gastric cancer
 cells. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-937 inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of
 gastric cancer cells by targeting FOXL2 via inactivation of PI3K/AKT
 signaling pathway. These results suggest that miR-937 may be a potential
 target for the treatment of gastric cancer.",
