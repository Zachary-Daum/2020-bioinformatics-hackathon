    abstract "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most frequent arthritic
 disease that causes disability and reduces life quality. The treatments for
 OA are conservative and more effective therapy remains to be identified.
 Herein, we mainly focused on the role of emodin in lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS)-induced murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cells as well as the underlying
 mechanisms. METHODS: In vitro cell system to mimic OA was constructed after
 LPS treatments. Effects of emodin on viability, apoptosis and release of
 inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MCP-1) in LPS-treated ATDC5 cells
 were measured. Then, expression of long non-coding RNA Taurine up-regulated
 gene 1 (TUG1) in emodin-treated ATDC5 cells was tested by reverse
 transcription-quantitative PCR. Finally, the involvements of the Notch and
 NF-kappaB pathways in the emodin-associated regulation were determined by
 Western blot analysis. Meanwhile, whether the alteration of these two
 pathways was associated with TUG1 was verified. RESULTS: The LPS-induced
 decrease of cell viability, increases of apoptosis and pro-inflammatory
 cytokines expression, and alterations of apoptosis-related proteins were all
 mitigated by emodin stimulation in ATDC5 cells. Then, we interestingly
 identified that TUG1 was up-regulated by emodin, and the Notch and NF-kappaB
 pathways were inhibited by emodin. More experiments proved that emodin
 inactivated these two pathways through up-regulating TUG1. CONCLUSION: Emodin
 mitigated the LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation in ATDC5 cells. Emodin
 might function through inhibiting the Notch and NF-kappaB pathways via
 up-regulating TUG1. Our findings might furnish a prospective therapeutic
 strategy using emodin for OA.",
