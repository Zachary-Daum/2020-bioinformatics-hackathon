    abstract "Ganoderic Acid A (GAA) is often applied for healing
 cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ailments, but the influences in cerebral
 ischemia injury are still hazy. The research delved into the functions of GAA
 in hypoxia-triggered impairment in PC12 cells. PC12 cells received hypoxia
 management for 12 hr, and subsequently, cell viability, migration, apoptosis,
 and correlative protein levels were assessed. After preprocessing with GAA,
 above cell behaviors were monitored again. The vector of microRNA (miR)-153
 inhibitor was utilized for PC12 cell transfection to further explore the
 functions of miR-153 in hypoxia-impaired cells. Pathways of
 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian
 target of rapamycin (mTOR) were investigated via executing western blot for
 uncovering the latent mechanism. Results revealed that hypoxia disposition
 triggered PC12 cells impairment via restraining cell viability and migration
 and accelerating apoptosis. However, GAA visibly mollified hypoxia-provoked
 impairment in PC12 cells. Interestingly, the enhancement of miR-153 triggered
 by GAA was observed in hypoxia-impaired PC12 cells. After miR-153 inhibitor
 transfection, the protective functions of GAA in hypoxia-impaired PC12 cells
 were dramatically inversed. Furthermore, GAA caused PI3K/AKT and mTOR
 activations via enhancement of miR-153 in hypoxia-impaired PC12 cells. The
 findings evinced that GAA exhibited the protective functions in PC12 cells
 against hypoxia-evoked impairment through activating PI3K/AKT and mTOR via
 elevating miR-153.",
