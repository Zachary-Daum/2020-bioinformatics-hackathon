    abstract "Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) results in death or
 long-term neurologic impairment in both adults and children. In this study,
 we investigated the effects of microRNA-132 (miR-132) dysregulation on
 oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced apoptosis in fetal rat hippocampal
 neurons, in order to reveal the therapeutic potential of miR-132 on HIBI.
 MiR-132 dysregulation was induced prior to OGD exposure by transfection of
 primary fetal rat hippocampal neurons with miR-132 mimic or miR-132
 inhibitor. The effects of miR-132 overexpression and suppression on
 OGD-stimulated hippocampal neurons were evaluated by detection of cell
 viability, apoptotic cells rate, and the expression of apoptosis-related
 proteins. Besides, TargetScan database and dual luciferase activity assay
 were used to seek a target gene of miR-132. As a result, miR-132 was highly
 expressed in hippocampal neurons following 2 h of OGD exposure. MiR-132
 overexpression significantly increased OGD-diminished cell viability and
 reduced OGD-induced apoptosis at 12, 24, and 48 h post-OGD. MiR-132
 overexpression significantly down-regulated the expressions of Bax,
 cytochrome c, and caspase-9, but up-regulated BCl-2. Caspase-3 activity was
 also significantly decreased by miR-132 overexpression. Furthermore, FOXO3
 was a direct target of miR-132, and it was negatively regulated by miR-132.
 To conclude, our results provide evidence that miR-132 protects hippocampal
 neurons against OGD injury by inhibiting apoptosis.",
