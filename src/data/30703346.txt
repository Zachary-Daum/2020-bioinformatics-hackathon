    abstract "BACKGROUND: Propofol is a popular anesthetic agent, with potent
 anti-tumor activity against many cancers. The objective of this study was to
 explore the potential effect of propofol on papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in
 vitro. METHODS: Human PTC cell lines TPC-1 and IHH-4 were treated by
 propofol. ANRIL expression vector (pc-ANRIL) was transfected into TPC-1 cells
 to overexpress the expression of ANRIL. CCK-8, BrdU assay, transwell assay,
 flow cytometry and Western blot were performed to evaluate cell
 proliferation, migration and apoptosis. The expression changes of ANRIL were
 detected by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Propofol with a concentration of 6mug/mL
 significantly reduced TPC-1 and IHH-4 cells proliferation and migration, and
 significantly induced apoptosis. However, 6mug/mL of propofol had no
 significant impacts on the proliferation and apoptosis of normal human
 thyroid follicular epithelial Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. Meanwhile, the expression
 of ANRIL in TPC-1 cells was down-regulated by propofol. The anti-tumor
 activity of propofol was attenuated when ANRIL was overexpressed.
 Additionally, propofol blocked Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways in an
 ANRIL-dependent fashion. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested the in vitro
 anti-tumor potential of propofol in PTC. One possible mechanism involved in
 the anti-tumor activity was preliminary revealed: propofol down-regulated the
 expression of ANRIL, and thus blocking Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB
 pathways.",
