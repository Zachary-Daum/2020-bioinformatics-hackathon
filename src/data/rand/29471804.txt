    abstract "BACKGROUND: Southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma,
 historically support a substantial fishery along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts
 of the southern United States. Low year-class strengths over the past few
 years in the western Gulf of Mexico have raised concern that spawning stocks
 may be overfished. Current management of the resource includes releasing
 hatchery-raised juveniles to restock bays and estuaries; additionally, there
 is a growing interest in the potential for commercial aquaculture of the
 species. Currently, genomic resources for southern flounder do not exist.
 Here, we used two hatchery-reared families and double-digest,
 restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to create a
 reduced-representation genomic library consisting of several thousand single
 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located throughout the genome. RESULTS: The
 relative position of each SNP-containing locus was determined to create a
 high-density genetic map spanning the 24 linkage groups of the southern
 flounder genome. The consensus map was used to identify regions of shared
 synteny between southern flounder and seven other fish species for which
 genome assemblies are available. Finally, syntenic blocks were used to
 localize genes identified from transcripts in European flounder as
 potentially being involved in ecotoxicological and osmoregulatory responses,
 as well as QTLs associated with growth and disease resistance in Japanese
 flounder, on the southern flounder linkage map. CONCLUSIONS: The information
 provided by the linkage map will enrich restoration efforts by providing a
 foundation for interpreting spatial genetic variation within the species,
 ultimately furthering an understanding of the adaptive potential and
 resilience of southern flounder to future changes in local environmental
 conditions. Further, the map will facilitate the use of genetic markers to
 enhance restoration and commercial aquaculture.",
