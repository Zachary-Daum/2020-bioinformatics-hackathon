    abstract "In the last few years, the concept of 'food addiction' has
 continued to gain popularity, with human and animal studies demonstrating the
 differential effects of foods that are high in fat, sugar or protein on
 appetite, satiety, eating behaviour and the development of food addiction.
 However, a number of studies have disputed the occurrence of food addiction
 in humans. Questions have also arisen regarding the possible impacts that
 food additives may have on the development of food addiction or eating
 disorders. Also, it is known that alterations in food composition and the
 presence of food additives (flavour enhancers, sugars, sugar substitutes, and
 non-nutritive sweeteners) are factors that generally influence the sensory
 perception of food. Our understanding of the potential roles of central
 neurotransmitters (such as dopamine) and certain neuropeptides in the
 evolution of food addiction is also evolving; but presently, there isn't
 sufficient scientific evidence to consider any food ingredient, micronutrient
 or standard food-additive as addictive. In this review, the relevant
 literatures dealing with the concept of 'food addiction' are examined, and
 the factors which may predispose to food addiction are discussed. The
 possible influences that flavour-enhancers, sugars, sugar substitutes and
 non-nutritive sweeteners may exert on central neurotransmission,
 neurotransmitter/receptor interactions, appetite, satiety, conditioned-
 preferences and the brain reward system are also highlighted.",
