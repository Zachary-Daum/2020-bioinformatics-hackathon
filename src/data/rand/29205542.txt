    abstract "Among the variety of stimuli-responsive materials,
 temperature-responsive materials (TRMs) can adapt to the surrounding
 environment in the presence of a thermal stimulus, and they have attracted
 considerable attention in sensors, actuators, and surface engineering.
 However, polymers, as the most representative TRMs, are far from ideal with
 respect to long-term reliability and durability. Here, for the first time, an
 inorganic material, ReS2 , is analyzed, which possesses an unexpected
 temperature-responsive behavior that is triggered by stable and reversible
 thermally induced bending (TIB). Due to thermal fluctuations in the ReS2
 layers, intrinsic ripples tend to aggravate rapidly with rising temperature.
 Then, the weak interlayer interaction of ReS2 is further weakened, thus
 resulting in interlayer sliding. Due to a decrease in bending rigidity with
 increasing temperature, out-of-plane bending spontaneously occurs in the ReS2
 layers. Interestingly, this TIB of ReS2 can recover to its initial
 configuration when the temperature drops, which is further confirmed by the
 reversible wetting measurement. Above all, the TIB behavior of ReS2 exhibits
 great potential in smart applications, such as smart windows and microfluidic
 devices, and fills the significant gaps of inorganic TRMs.",
