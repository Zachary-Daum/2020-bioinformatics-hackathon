    abstract "pirScan is a web-based tool for identifying C. elegans
 piRNA-targeting sites within a given mRNA or spliced DNA sequence. The
 purpose of our tool is to allow C. elegans researchers to predict piRNA
 targeting sites and to avoid the persistent germline silencing of transgenes
 that has rendered many constructs unusable. pirScan fulfills this purpose by
 first enumerating the predicted piRNA-targeting sites present in an input
 sequence. This prediction can be exported in a tabular or graphical format.
 Subsequently, pirScan suggests silent mutations that can be introduced to the
 input sequence that would allow the modified transgene to avoid piRNA
 targeting. The user can customize the piRNA targeting stringency and the
 silent mutations that he/she wants to introduce into the sequence. The
 modified sequences can be re-submitted to be certain that any previously
 present piRNA-targeting sites are now absent and no new piRNA-targeting sites
 are accidentally generated. This revised sequence can finally be downloaded
 as a text file and/or visualized in a graphical format. pirScan is freely
 available for academic use at http://cosbi4.ee.ncku.edu.tw/pirScan/.",
