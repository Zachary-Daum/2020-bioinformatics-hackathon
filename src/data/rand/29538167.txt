    abstract "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the last several years prostate artery
 embolization (PAE) has been developed as a minimally invasive technique for
 the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia induced lower urinary tract
 symptoms. This review aims to elucidate the data available on this developing
 technique and identify areas requiring further investigation. RECENT
 FINDINGS: Recent studies have demonstrated that PAE is able to deliver
 excellent clinical outcomes in terms of International Prostate Symptom Score,
 quality-of-life score, maximum urinary flow rate, post-void residual, and
 prostate volume reduction. These outcomes have been accomplished with a very
 low complication profile. Several authors have also been able to demonstrate
 good outcomes with PAE in the setting of large prostates, a challenge for
 some other minimally invasive techniques. However, it is important to note
 that the majority of studies published have been retrospective in nature, and
 the two prospective clinical trials have had several weaknesses. SUMMARY:
 Initial data on PAE shows it can provide excellent clinical outcomes with
 patients experiencing minimal complications. However, more high-quality,
 high-level data are needed particularly in regards to long-term outcomes to
 determine durability.",
