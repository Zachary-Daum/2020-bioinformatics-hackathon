    abstract "BACKGROUND: Haplotype assembly is the task of reconstructing
 haplotypes of an individual from a mixture of sequenced chromosome fragments.
 Haplotype information enables studies of the effects of genetic variations on
 an organism's phenotype. Most of the mathematical formulations of haplotype
 assembly are known to be NP-hard and haplotype assembly becomes even more
 challenging as the sequencing technology advances and the length of the
 paired-end reads and inserts increases. Assembly of haplotypes polyploid
 organisms is considerably more difficult than in the case of diploids. Hence,
 scalable and accurate schemes with provable performance are desired for
 haplotype assembly of both diploid and polyploid organisms. RESULTS: We
 propose a framework that formulates haplotype assembly from sequencing data
 as a sparse tensor decomposition. We cast the problem as that of decomposing
 a tensor having special structural constraints and missing a large fraction
 of its entries into a product of two factors, U and [Formula: see text];
 tensor [Formula: see text] reveals haplotype information while U is a sparse
 matrix encoding the origin of erroneous sequencing reads. An algorithm,
 AltHap, which reconstructs haplotypes of either diploid or polyploid
 organisms by iteratively solving this decomposition problem is proposed. The
 performance and convergence properties of AltHap are theoretically analyzed
 and, in doing so, guarantees on the achievable minimum error correction
 scores and correct phasing rate are established. The developed framework is
 applicable to diploid, biallelic and polyallelic polyploid species. The code
 for AltHap is freely available from https://github.com/realabolfazl/AltHap .
 CONCLUSION: AltHap was tested in a number of different scenarios and was
 shown to compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods in applications to
 haplotype assembly of diploids, and significantly outperforms existing
 techniques when applied to haplotype assembly of polyploids.",
