    abstract "Signaling from the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a Gs
 protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crucial for melanocyte proliferation and
 differentiation, is regulated by cytosolic beta-arrestins (ARRBs). MC1R
 signaling is also negatively modulated by the E3-ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin
 Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1), whose mutation causes hyperpigmentation, congenital
 heart defects and neurodegeneration in mice. We showed previously that
 although MC1R interacts stably with human ARRB1 or ARRB2, only ARRB2 mediates
 receptor desensitization and internalization. We analyzed MC1R-dependent ARRB
 ubiquitination, and the possible role of MGRN1. ARRB1 expressed in
 heterologous cells or human melanoma cells migrated in SDS-PAGE as a 55kDa
 protein whereas ARRB2 migrated as two major bands of apparent molecular
 weight near 45 and 55kDa, with an intermediate mobility band occasionally
 detected. These forms were related by post-translational modification rather
 than by proteolysis. Presence of MC1R favored expression of the 45kDa
 protein, the form that interacted preferentially with MC1R. MC1R also
 mediated poly- or multimonoubiquitination of ARRB2. Ubiquitination was
 agonist-independent, but required a native MC1R conformation and/or normal
 receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane, as it was not observed for
 loss-of-function MC1R variants. In a heterologous expression system,
 MC1R-dependent ARRB ubiquitination was enhanced by overexpression of MGRN1
 and was impaired by siRNA-mediated MGRN1 knockdown thus pointing to MGRN1 as
 the responsible E3-ligase. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated
 interaction of MGRN1 and ARRBs in the presence of MC1R, suggesting a
 scaffolding role for the GPCR that may determine the selectivity of
 E3-ubiquitin ligase engagement and the functional outcome of ARRB
 ubiquitination.",
