    abstract "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate fertility, pregnancy, and clinical
 outcomes after uterine arteriovenous malformation (UAVM) management. DESIGN:
 Single-center retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification III).
 SETTING: One referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with a UAVM
 diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomography
 angiography and managed by expectant management (EM) or uterine arterial
 embolization (UAE) during the study period were included. INTERVENTIONS: Nine
 of 22 patients underwent first-intention EM and 13 first-line UAE. Three of 9
 EM patients (33.3%) required emergency second-intention UAE for nonresolution
 of the UAVM and severe genital bleeding. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: To
 analyze fertility according to management approach, we defined 2 groups: EM
 only group (n=6) and UAE group (n=16; women who underwent first- or
 second-intention UAE). Overall, the median age was 29 years (range, 17-43).
 The mean follow-up after UAVM management was 39 months (range, 1-116). The
 success rate of the UAE procedure was 87.5% (14/16). Eight of 12 women
 (66.7%) who wished to conceive became pregnant: 2 of 5 (33.3%) in the EM
 group and 6 of 7 (85.7%) in the UAE group (p=1). Overall, 11 patients (50%)
 conceived: 3 in the EM group (50%) and 8 in the UAE group (50%) (p=.9). The
 live birth rate was 36.4% (8/22) for the whole population. There were no
 miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies. The 8 women (72.7%) wishing to conceive
 who became pregnant all delivered: 1 by cesarean section and 7 by vaginal
 delivery. Median duration of pregnancy was 39 weeks and 5 days. The remaining
 3 women (i.e., women who conceived but did not wish to become pregnant) had
 therapeutic abortions. One complication was experienced in the EM group
 (small for gestational age newborn) and none in the UAE group (p=.3).
 Limitations include retrospective design and small sample size. CONCLUSION:
 UAE for UAVM is an effective and safe technique. It does not impair
 fertility, and obstetric prognosis is good.",
