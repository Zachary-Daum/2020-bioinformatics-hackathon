    abstract "Metastatic breast cancer is one of the most common metastatic
 tumors. Although studies have validated the role of beta-inducible gene-h3
 (betaig-h3) in human biology and disease, the detailed mechanisms mediated by
 betaig-h3 in breast carcinoma metastasis remain unclear. Thus, the present
 study investigated the role and potential mechanism of betaig-h3 during
 breast carcinoma cell metastasis. The results indicated that the upregulation
 of betaig-h3 significantly promotes the growth and inhibits the
 cisplatin-induced apoptosis of breast carcinoma cells. It was also
 demonstrated that betaig-h3 promoted the migration and invasion of human
 breast carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the results
 demonstrated that betaig-h3 upregulated the overall expression and
 phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B
 (Akt) in human breast carcinoma cells. By contrast, betaig-h3 knockdown
 reversed the betaig-h3-mediated characteristics of breast carcinoma cells.
 Thus, the current study demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
 serves a role in betaig-h3-induced human breast cancer cell metastasis and
 that betaig-h3 transfection enhances the metastatic potential of human breast
 carcinoma cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These observations
 contribute to the understanding of the potential mechanism of human breast
 carcinoma cell growth and metastasis and suggest that betaig-h3 may be a
 promising therapeutic target for the treatment of human breast carcinoma.",
