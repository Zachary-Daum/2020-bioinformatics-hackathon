    abstract "In this study, a novel method for the simultaneous determination
 and accurate quantification of abused drugs in human urine was developed.
 Antibody conjugated boronic acid modified magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4,
 MNPs) were prepared for the selectively purification of illicit drugs in
 combination with high resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. Illicit drugs,
 amphetamine (AM) and methamphetamine (MA), were used as model analytes to
 demonstrate the feasibility of our strategy. Boronic acid functionalized MNPs
 were first prepared via one-pot synthesis to simplify and improve the
 efficiency of a chemical reaction. Anti-amphetamine antibody (anti-AM
 antibody) and anti-methamphetamine antibody (anti-MA antibody) was conjugated
 onto boronic acid modified MNPs, respectively, through the formation of
 boronate ester bond that could maintain the correct orientation to maximally
 capture their antigens. The capacity of antibody conjugation to boronic acid
 modified MNPs was at least 24mug antibody/mg MNPs. Antibody-conjugated MNPs
 were designed to specifically capture AM and MA in human urine samples, both
 of which can be directly eluted to MALDI target plate by adding MALDI CHCA
 matrix solution for the following MALDI-MS analysis. The linear range of
 detection of the proposed method were 25-400ng/mL and 25-1000ng/mL with
 coefficients of determination between 0.9923 and 0.9997 for AM and MA,
 respectively. The lowest detectable concentrations of AM and MA were 1.87 and
 3.75ng/mL, respectively. More importantly, the proposed method allows rapid
 and accurate quantification of AM and MA from three suspects' urine samples.
 The obtained results are consistent with traditional GC/MS analysis.
 Antibody-conjugated MNPs could thus prove to be powerful tools for important
 applications such as forensic science, food safety and clinical diagnosis of
 disease.",
