    abstract "Quantum transport of electrons through a molecule is a series of
 individual electron tunneling events separated by stochastic waiting time
 intervals. We study the emergence of temporal correlations between successive
 waiting times for the electron transport in a vibrating molecular junction.
 Using the master equation approach, we compute the joint probability
 distribution for waiting times of two successive tunneling events. We show
 that the probability distribution is completely reset after each tunneling
 event if molecular vibrations are thermally equilibrated. If we treat
 vibrational dynamics exactly without imposing the equilibration constraint,
 the statistics of electron tunneling events become non-renewal. Non-renewal
 statistics between two waiting times tau1 and tau2 means that the density
 matrix of the molecule is not fully renewed after time tau1 and the
 probability of observing waiting time tau2 for the second electron transfer
 depends on the previous electron waiting time tau1. The strong
 electron-vibration coupling is required for the emergence of the non-renewal
 statistics. We show that in the Franck-Condon blockade regime, extremely rare
 tunneling events become positively correlated.",
