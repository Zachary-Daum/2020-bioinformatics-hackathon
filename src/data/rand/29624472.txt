    abstract "To provide definite evidence for the anti-hypertensive benefit
 of Baroreflex Activation Therapy (BAT) for resistant hypertension, we
 performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and
 safety of BAT. Electronic searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, The
 Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently determined
 the eligibility of studies and extracted the data. The quality of all
 included studies was evaluated by the use of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale
 (NOS). Disagreements were settled through discussion. Twelve studies,
 included one randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and eleven prospective studies
 were eligible for qualitative analysis and five prospective studies were
 selected for meta-analysis. The data of analysis showed office systolic blood
 pressure (SBP)(WMD = -24.01, 95% CI = -28.65 to -19.36, P= 0.753I(2) = 0.0%)
 and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)(WMD = -12.53, 95% CI = -15.82 to -9.24,P =
 0.893,I(2) = 0.893) decreased by BAT treatment.The effect on SBP was both
 significant in the Barostim neo TM device (WMD = -22.49, 95% CI = -29.13 to
 15.84, P= 0.443; I(2) = 0.0%) and Rheos System (WMD = 25.46, 95% CI = -31.96
 to -18.96, P= 0.703; I(2) = 0.0%). Our study found office BP were
 significantly decreased by BAT treatment, but available evidence is limited
 by risk of bias, small sample size, and few RCTs. Thus, there is presently
 insufficient evidence to fully evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAT for
 Patients with Resistant Hypertension. Additional high-quality RCT research
 with long-term follow-up is required.",
