    abstract "Norovirus (NoV) and Hepatitis A virus (HAV) are the most
 important viral hazards associated with human illness following consumption
 of contaminated bivalve molluscs. The effectiveness of the current EU
 criteria for heat processing of bivalve molluscs (i.e. raising the
 temperature of the internal mollusc flesh to at least 90 degrees C for a
 minimum of 90 seconds) was evaluated using predictive microbiology. A HAV
 thermal inactivation model was developed based on literature data in mollusc
 matrices during isothermal heat treatment. Application of the developed model
 demonstrated that the 90 degrees C-90 s requirement may lead to significantly
 different virus inactivation depending on the commercial process design. This
 shows the need for the establishment of a Performance Criterion for bivalve
 molluscs heat processing which will assure a common specified level of
 consumer protection. A risk-based approach is described that allows for an
 effective processing design providing a more transparent and objective
 relation between the thermal processing targets and public health. Model
 simulations demonstrate that the F-value is a more appropriate Process
 Criterion than a single time-temperature combination since it enables the
 food business operators to design a process that is compliant with the safety
 requirements while at the same time achieving a desired product quality.",
