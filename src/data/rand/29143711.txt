    abstract "In this study, the economic values for production and functional
 traits of dairy sheep are estimated through the application of a profit
 function model using farm-level technical and economic data. The traits
 incorporated in the model were milk production, prolificacy, fertility,
 milking speed, longevity and mastitis occurrence. The economic values for
 these traits were derived as the approximate partial derivative of the
 specified profit function. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted in order
 to examine how potential changes in input and output prices would affect the
 breeding goal. The estimated economic values of the traits revealed their
 economic impact on the definition of the breeding goal for the specified
 production system. Milk production and fertility had the highest economic
 values (euro40.30 and euro20.28 per standard genetic deviation (SDa)), while,
 mastitis only had a low negative value of -0.57 euro/SDa. Therefore, breeding
 for clinical mastitis will have a minor impact on farm profitability because
 it affects a small proportion of the flock and has low additive variance. The
 production traits, which include milk production, prolificacy and milking
 speed, contributed most to the breeding goal (70.0%), but functional traits
 still had a considerable share (30.0%). The results of this study highlight
 the importance of the knowledge of economic values of traits in the design of
 a breeding program. It is also suggested that the production and functional
 traits under consideration can be categorized as those which can be
 efficiently treated through genetic improvement (e.g. milk production and
 fertility) while others would be better dealt with through managerial
 interventions (e.g. mastitis occurrence). Also, sub-clinical mastitis that
 affects a higher proportion of flocks could have a higher contribution to
 breeding goals.",
