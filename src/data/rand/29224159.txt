    abstract "The defining feature of the Quantitative Multiplex
 Methylation-Specific PCR (QM-MSP) method to sensitively quantify DNA
 methylation is the two-step PCR approach for a multiplexed analysis of a
 panel of up to 12 genes in clinical samples with minimal quantities of DNA.
 In the first step, for up to 12 genes tested, one pair of gene-specific
 primers (forward and reverse) amplifies the methylated and unmethylated
 copies of the same gene simultaneously and in multiplex, in one PCR reaction.
 This methylation-independent amplification step produces amplicons of up to
 10(9) copies per muL after 36 cycles of PCR. In the second step, the
 amplicons of the first reaction (STEP 1) are quantified with a standard curve
 using real-time PCR and two independent fluorophores to detect
 methylated/unmethylated DNA of each gene in the same well (e.g., 6FAM and
 VIC). One methylated copy is detectable in 100,000 reference gene copies.
 Methylation is reported on a continuous scale. For the gene panel, the
 highest level of normal DNA methylation above which a sample would be called
 positive is derived by using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC),
 maximizing assay specificity and sensitivity to distinguish between
 normal/benign versus tumor DNA. QM-MSP can be applied to clinical samples of
 fresh or fixed ductal cells, ductal fluid, nipple fluid, fine needle
 aspirates, core biopsies, and tumor tissue sections.",
