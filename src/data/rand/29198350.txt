    abstract "Using a switching stick from the posterior portal is a
 frequently employed method of identifying the location for the subscapularis
 split for a shoulder arthroscopic Latarjet. However, in a recent cadaveric
 study, in none of the 20 specimens studied did this technique result in the
 split being placed in the preferred position-the junction of the superior
 two-thirds and the inferior one-third of the subscapularis. As a result, if
 the position of the coracoid graft is too superior, the anteroinferior
 extension of the glenoid arc and the vector of the conjoined sling may be
 suboptimal and fail to restrain humeral head translation. There is thus a
 need for a more reliable method for establishing the subscapularis split in
 patients with shoulder instability and significant glenoid bone loss.
 Moreover, in comparison to the open Latarjet surgical technique, an
 arthroscopic Latarjet procedure is notably more complex, technically
 challenging, and involves a demanding learning curve. For any procedure, the
 morbidity curve is inversely related to the learning curve-the lower one is
 on the learning curve, the greater the expected complications. The area
 beneath the morbidity curve is related to increased costs to manage
 complications and suboptimal outcomes. Study, practice, acquisition, and
 refinement of the necessary skills needed to perform a complex procedure
 should be done primarily in the cadaver lab. It is imperative that each of us
 critically evaluate our own experience and clinical practice to determine if
 we have or expect to generate the critical volume necessary to successfully
 master the arthroscopic Latarjet techniques and to retain the expertise
 needed for optimal patient outcomes.",
