    abstract "BACKGROUND: The shedding of epithelial squames (skin scales) by
 staff in operating theatre air is an important source of deep infection
 following joint replacement surgery. This is a serious complication,
 resulting in significant morbidity for the patient and substantial cost
 implications for healthcare systems. Much effort has been put into providing
 clean air in operating theatres, yet little attention has been given to
 reducing the shedding of surface skin scales at source. AIM: To develop a
 novel method for calculating surface skin scale density using surface
 microscopy, and to use it to evaluate the effect of a skincare regimen on
 operating theatre staff. METHODS: Surface microscopy with Z-stacked imaging
 was used to visualize the effect of a skincare regimen involving three
 stages: washing with soap; exfoliation; and application of emollient. A USB
 microscope was then used in a field study to take images of the skin of
 operating theatre staff who applied the regimen to one lower limb the night
 before testing. The other limb was used as a control. Two blinded assessors
 analysed scale density. RESULTS: Z-stack images from the surface microscope
 enabled observations of the skincare regimen. The USB microscope also
 provided adequate images that enabled assessment of skin scale density. In
 the operating theatre staff, a 72.1% reduction in visible skin scales was
 observed following application of the skincare regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Further
 work is required to demonstrate how this effect correlates with dispersion of
 skin particles in a cleanroom, and subsequently in live operating theatre
 studies.",
