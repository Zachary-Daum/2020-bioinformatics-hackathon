    abstract "Genetically encoded fluorescent proteins, combined with
 fluorescence microscopy, are widely used in cell biology to collect kinetic
 data on intracellular trafficking. Methods for extraction of quantitative
 information from these data are based on the mathematics of diffusion and
 tracer kinetics. Current methods, although useful and powerful, depend on the
 assumption that the cellular system being studied is in a steady state, that
 is, the assumption that all the molecular concentrations and fluxes are
 constant for the duration of the experiment. Here, we derive new tracer
 kinetic analytical methods for non-steady state biological systems by
 constructing mechanistic nonlinear differential equation models of the
 underlying cell biological processes and linking them to a separate set of
 differential equations governing the kinetics of the fluorescent tracer.
 Linking the two sets of equations is based on a new application of the
 fundamental tracer principle of indistinguishability and, unlike current
 methods, supports correct dependence of tracer kinetics on cellular dynamics.
 This approach thus provides a general mathematical framework for applications
 of GFP fluorescence microscopy (including photobleaching [FRAP, FLIP] and
 photoactivation to frequently encountered experimental protocols involving
 physiological or pharmacological perturbations (e.g., growth factors,
 neurotransmitters, acute knockouts, inhibitors, hormones, cytokines, and
 metabolites) that initiate mechanistically informative intracellular
 transients. When a new steady state is achieved, these methods automatically
 reduce to classical steady state tracer kinetic analysis.",
