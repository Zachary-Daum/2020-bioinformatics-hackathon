    abstract "BACKGROUND: The Breast DX Italy prospective study evaluated the
 impact of the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) result on adjuvant treatment
 decisions for patients with early breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine
 centers (two Hub and seven Spoke centers of the Veneto Oncology Network)
 participated. Consecutive patients with estrogen receptor positive, human
 epidermal growth receptor negative, T1-T3, N0-N1 early breast cancer were
 prospectively registered; only those meeting protocol-defined
 clinicopathological ""intermediate risk"" criteria were eligible for the RS
 test. Pre-RS and post-RS physicians' treatment recommendations and treatment
 actually received were collected. RESULTS: A total of n = 124 N0 and n = 126
 N1 patients underwent the RS assay. The majority had Grade 2 tumors (71%);
 median age was 55 years, median tumor size was 16 mm, and median Ki67
 expression was 20%. Patients enrolled at Hub centers presented higher-risk
 features. The distribution of RS results was <18 (60.8%), 18-30 (32.4%), and
 >30 (6.8%). The indication before RS was hormonal therapy (HT) alone in 52%
 of cases. An indication before RS of chemotherapy (CT)+HT was more frequent
 for patients with N1 versus N0 tumors (57% vs. 39%, p = .0035) and for
 patients enrolled at Hub versus Spoke centers (54% vs. 36%, p = .007).The
 overall rate of change in treatment decision was 16% (n = 40), mostly from
 CT+HT to HT (n = 30). According to nodal status, rate of change in treatment
 decision was 12% for the N0 cohort and 20% for the N1 cohort. The proportion
 of patients recommended to CT+HT was significantly reduced from before to
 after RS (48% to 40%, p < .0016), especially in the N1 cohort (57% to 45%, p
 = .0027) and at Hub centers (54% to 44%, p = .001). CONCLUSION: Despite
 frequent indication of HT before RS, the use of the RS assay further
 contributed to sparing CT, especially for patients with N1 tumors and at Hub
 centers. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study shows that, although a high
 proportion of patients were recommended to receive endocrine treatment alone
 before knowing the recurrence score (RS) assay, the RS test further
 contributed in sparing chemotherapy for some of these patients, especially in
 case of the N1 stage or for patients enrolled at referral centers. These data
 highlight the need for further work in collaboration with health authorities
 and companies in order to define strategies for the implementation of the use
 of RS testing in clinical practice in the Italian setting.",
