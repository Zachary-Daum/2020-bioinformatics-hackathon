    abstract "Oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is a pro-atherogenic
 molecule, which induces inflammatory response and contributes to the
 pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction to atherosclerosis. The aim of the
 present study was to explore the anti-inflammatory effect of a novel
 bioavailable formulation of curcumin as 'curcumagalactomannosides' (CGM)
 against ox-LDL-induced inflammatory responses in human peripheral blood
 mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Curcumagalactomannosides was made from natural
 curcumin using the soluble dietary fibre (galactomannans) derived from
 fenugreek seeds (Trigonella foenumgracum) and the hPBMCs were isolated from
 healthy human volunteers. The cells were cultured in collagen-coated plates
 at 37  degrees C and grouped as Group I (Control), Group II (ox-LDL treated)
 and Group III (ox-LDL + CGM treated). Further analysis of inflammatory
 markers, reactive oxygen species and mRNA expression levels indicated
 significantly increased expressions of iNOS, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and VCAM-1 in
 ox-LDL-treated group along with the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Other
 inflammatory markers such as LOX, PGE2, total COX and lipid peroxidation
 level were also found to be significantly (p < 0.05) increased upon ox-LDL
 treatment. The treatment with CGM on the other hand was found to
 down-regulate and reverse the ox-LDL-induced alterations indicating its
 potential anti-inflammatory effect on hPBMCs via. NF-kappaB signalling
 pathway.",
