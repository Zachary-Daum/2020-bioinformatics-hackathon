    abstract "BACKGROUND: Tau protein is s specific protein expressed by
 neurons in the central nervous system. Elevated serum Tau protein is
 associated with many diseases of the central nervous system. The serum Tau
 protein level in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is still
 poorly understood. METHODS: Forty-one human neonates with HIE and thirty-five
 healthy neonates (control group) within 24 hours after birth were studied.
 Tau protein in serum was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
 Neurological outcome was assessed at 9 months of age according to the Gesell
 developmental scale. RESULTS: Tau protein in serum was significantly higher
 in the HIE group than in the control group (p < 0.01), in neonates with
 severe HIE than neonates with moderate HIE (p < 0.01), and in infants with
 neurodevelopmental retardation compared with those with normal
 neurodevelopment (p < 0.01). The result of this study showed an obvious
 negative correlation between the serum Tau protein level and development
 quotients of neonates with HIE (rs = -0.6172, p < 0.01). Receiver operator
 characteristic curve analysis showed that Tau protein (cutoff value 933.04
 pg/mL) was a predictor of neurodevelopmental retardation outcome (AUC value =
 0.860 (95% CI: 0.736 - 0.983, p < 0.01), sensitivity 100%, specificity
 70.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Serum Tau protein level within 24 hours after birth can
 be used as a marker for the early diagnosis of neonatal HIE and predicting
 neurodevelopmental outcomes.",
