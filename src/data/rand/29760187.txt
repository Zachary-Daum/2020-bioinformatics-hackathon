    abstract "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an indispensable immune receptor
 for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the Gram-negative
 bacterial cell wall. Following LPS stimulation, TLR4 transmits the signal
 from the cell surface and becomes internalized in an endosome. However, the
 spatial regulation of TLR4 signaling is not fully understood. Here, we
 investigated the mechanisms of LPS-induced TLR4 internalization and clarified
 the roles of the extracellular LPS-binding molecules, LPS-binding protein
 (LBP), and glycerophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (CD14). LPS
 stimulation of CD14-expressing cells induced TLR4 internalization in the
 presence of serum, and an inhibitory anti-LBP mAb blocked its
 internalization. Addition of LBP to serum-free cultures restored LPS-induced
 TLR4 internalization to comparable levels of serum. The secretory form of the
 CD14 (sCD14) induced internalization but required a much higher concentration
 than LBP. An inhibitory anti-sCD14 mAb was ineffective for serum-mediated
 internalization. LBP lacking the domain for LPS transfer to CD14 and a CD14
 mutant with reduced LPS binding both attenuated TLR4 internalization.
 Accordingly, LBP is an essential serum molecule for TLR4 internalization, and
 its LPS transfer to membrane-anchored CD14 (mCD14) is a prerequisite. LBP
 induced the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of TBK1, IKK, and IRF3, leading to
 IFN-beta expression. However, LPS-stimulated late activation of NF-kappaB or
 necroptosis were not affected. Collectively, our results indicate that LBP
 controls LPS-induced TLR4 internalization, which induces TLR adaptor molecule
 1 (TRIF)-dependent activation of the TBK1-IKK-IRF3-IFN-beta pathway. In
 summary, we showed that LBP-mediated LPS transfer to mCD14 is required for
 serum-dependent TLR4 internalization and activation of the TRIF pathway.",
