    abstract "PURPOSE: Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) have become
 a cornerstone of assessment in competency-based medical education (CBME).
 Increasingly, EPAs are being adopted that do not conform to EPA standards.
 This study aimed to develop and validate a scoring rubric to evaluate EPAs
 for alignment with their purpose, and to identify substandard EPAs. METHOD:
 The EQual rubric was developed and revised by a team of education scholars
 with expertise in EPAs. It was then applied by four residency program
 directors/CBME leads (PDs) and four nonclinician support staff to 31
 stage-specific EPAs developed for internal medicine in the Royal College of
 Physicians and Surgeons of Canada's Competency by Design framework. Results
 were analyzed using a generalizability study to evaluate overall reliability,
 with the EPAs as the object of measurement. Item-level analysis was performed
 to determine reliability and discrimination value for each item. Scores from
 the PDs were also compared with decisions about revisions made independently
 by the education scholars group. RESULTS: The EQual rubric demonstrated high
 reliability in the G-study with a phi-coefficient of 0.84 when applied by the
 PDs, and moderate reliability when applied by the support staff at 0.67.
 Item-level analysis identified three items that performed poorly with low
 item discrimination and low interrater reliability indices. Scores from
 support staff only moderately correlated with PDs. Using the preestablished
 cut score, PDs identified 9 of 10 EPAs deemed to require major revision.
 CONCLUSIONS: EQual rubric scores reliably measured alignment of EPAs with
 literature-described standards. Further, its application accurately
 identified EPAs requiring major revisions.",
