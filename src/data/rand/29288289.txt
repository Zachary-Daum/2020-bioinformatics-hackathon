    abstract "OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine the comparative
 effectiveness of oromandibular defect reconstruction via anterolateral thigh
 flap and bridging plate (ALT only) versus simultaneous soft tissue and
 vascularized bone flap (DFF), with regards to long-term plate exposure and
 complications. METHODS: A propensity score-matched analysis of patients with
 an oncologic head and neck defect who underwent microvascular reconstruction
 was performed. Two surgical groups, i.e., ALT only and DFF, were created.
 Incidence and subsequent management strategies for postoperative plate
 exposure were evaluated along with complications, overall survival, and
 postoperative quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were 1:1
 propensity matched (31 per group). The DFF group had a significantly larger
 soft tissue and bone defect than the single-flap group. The 5-year
 probability of not having a plate exposure was 45.5 and 47.4% for the
 double-flaps and single-flap groups, respectively (p = 0.186). The ALT-only
 group had a significantly higher rate of wound infections (38.7% vs. 12.9%, p
 = 0.02). The incidence of flap loss, reexploration, inpatient mortality,
 plate fracture, medical complications, and overall survival were not
 significantly different. Although mean score for pain was significantly worse
 in the ALT-only group (75.2 vs. 88.5, p < 0.001), the remainder of our QoL
 assessments (cosmesis, swallow, employment, and speech) were comparable.
 CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of an ALT with plate strategy is associated with
 competitive rates of plate exposure and overall survival relative to DFF but
 higher wound infections and long-term pain. These results have considerable
 salience for patient-counseling regarding expectations for functional and
 clinical outcomes.",
