    abstract "Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment
 and prognosis of primary gastric lymphomas (PGL). Methods: A retrospective
 study was conducted in 124 cases of PGL from July 2009 to January 2016 in our
 hospital, and the clinical records, pathological and immunohistochemical
 features were analyzed. The relationship between different factors at
 diagnosis and prognosis were studied. Results: 124 cases of PGL included 93
 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients, 25 mucosa associated lymphoid
 tissue (MALT) lymphoma cases, 1 mantle cell lymphoma, 4 peripheral T-cell
 lymphoma-not otherwise specified, and 1 extra-nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma-nasal
 type. Of the 93 primary gastric DLBCL (PG-DLBCL) patients, the germinal
 center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL were 45 cases, non-GCB DLBCL were 48 cases. 10
 cases (10.8%) of 93 PG-DLBCL were transformed from gastric MALT, and 7 cases
 (7.5%) have bone marrow involvement. Evidence of Helicobacter pylori
 infection was detected in 21 cases (51.2%) of 41 DLBCL patients and in 10
 cases (43.5%) of 23 MALT patients. Univariate analysis revealed that clinical
 stages (P=0.002) , B symptoms (P=0.001) , international prognostic index
 (IPI) score (P<0.001) , anemia (P<0.001) , low level of serum albumin level
 (P=0.001) , high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P<0.001) , high
 beta2-microglobulin (P=0.003) , chemotherapy uncombined with rituximab
 (P=0.006) were factors affecting progression-free survival (PFS).
 Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that clinical stages
 (HR=5.113, 95% CI 1.087-24.048, P=0.039) and LDH (HR=5.111, 95%CI
 1.651-15.827, P=0.005) were independent poor prognosis factors affecting PFS.
 In the non-GCB group, the PFS was significantly extended (P=0.013) , the OS
 has no statistical significance (P=0.764). The PFS was significantly
 shortened in MALT transformed to DLBCL compared with MALT lymphoma patients
 (P=0.016) , but have no statistical significance compared with DLBCL patients
 (P=0.373). Conclusions: The types of DLBCL and MALT are more common in PGL.
 PG-DLBCL is a highly heterogeneous malignant tumor, and advanced clinical
 stages and high LDH value are associated with poor outcome.",
