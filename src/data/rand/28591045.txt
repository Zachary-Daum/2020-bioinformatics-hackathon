    abstract "OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to perform a meta-analysis
 including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficiency and
 safety of tranexamic acid (TXA) for reducing blood loss and transfusion
 requirements in patients undergoing open myomectomy. METHODS: A systematic
 search was performed in Medline (1966-2017.03), PubMed (1966-2017.03), Embase
 (1980-2017.03), ScienceDirect (1985-2017.03,) and the Cochrane Library. Study
 evaluated the efficiency and safety of TXA in myomectomy was selected.
 Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 11.0 software. RESULTS: Four RCTs
 including 328 patients met the inclusion criteria. The present meta-analysis
 indicated that there were significant differences between groups in terms of
 total blood loss (standard mean difference [SMD] = -1.512, 95% confidence
 interval [CI]: -2.746 to -0.278, P = .016), postoperative hemoglobin level
 (SMD = 0.650, 95% CI: 0.045-1.255, P = .035), transfusion requirements (SMD =
 -0.102, 95% CI: -0.199 to -0.006, P = .038), and duration of surgery (SMD =
 -0.514, 95% CI: -0.749 to -0.280, P = .000). In addition, no adverse effect
 was identified in treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous administration
 of TXA in open myomectomy was associated with significantly reduced total
 blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin decline, duration of surgery, and
 transfusion requirements. Based on the limitations of the current
 meta-analysis, high-quality RCTs with long-term follow-up are still required.",
