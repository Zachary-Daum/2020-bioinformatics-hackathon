    abstract "Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) has proven very effective in
 the management of renal stones. However, complications are not so rare, and
 bleeding is one of the most worrisome; it has a reported incidence of 1%-3%
 and may happen during track dilatation. In addition, arterial pseudoaneurysms
 and/or arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) may occur. We report the case of a
 patient with an intrarenal pseudoaneurysm associated with an AVF, after PCNL.
 Superselective endovascular embolization with Onyx((R)) was successfully
 performed, achieving exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm and AVF with
 preservation of the remaining vascularization of the kidney. We review the
 literature regarding endovascular management of kidney vascular lesions after
 PCNL. Selective renal embolization is a minimally invasive procedure, highly
 effective with a low incidence of complications. Currently, it is considered
 the most appropriate technique in the treatment of arterial iatrogenic
 complications following percutaneous renal procedures. Onyx((R)) is an
 effective, easy to handle, and safe alternative embolic agent for these
 procedures.",
