    abstract "In Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) of plants, a
 single-strand (ss) T-DNA covalently linked with a VirD2 protein moves through
 a bacterial type IV secretion channel called VirB/D4. This transport system
 originates from conjugal plasmid transfer systems of bacteria. The relaxase
 VirD2 and its equivalent protein Mob play essential roles in T-DNA transfer
 and mobilizable plasmid transfer, respectively. In this study, we attempted
 to transfer a model T-DNA plasmid, which contained no left border but had a
 right border sequence as an origin of transfer, and a mobilizable plasmid
 through the VirB/D4 apparatus to Escherichia coli, Agrobacterium and yeast to
 compare VirD2-driven transfer with Mob-driven one. AMT was successfully
 achieved by both types of transfer to the three recipient organisms.
 VirD2-driven AMT of the two bacteria was less efficient than Mob-driven AMT.
 In contrast, AMT of yeast guided by VirD2 was more efficient than that by
 Mob. Plasmid DNAs recovered from the VirD2-driven AMT colonies showed the
 original plasmid structure. These data indicate that VirD2 retains most of
 its important functions in recipient bacterial cells, but has largely adapted
 to eukaryotes rather than bacteria. The high AMT efficiency of yeast suggests
 that VirD2 can also efficiently bring ssDNA to recipient bacterial cells but
 is inferior to Mob in some process leading to the formation of
 double-stranded circular DNA in bacteria. This study also revealed that the
 recipient recA gene was significantly involved in VirD2-dependent AMT, but
 only partially involved in Mob-dependent AMT. The apparent difference in the
 recA gene requirement between the two types of AMT suggests that VirD2 is
 worse at re-circularization to complete complementary DNA synthesis than Mob
 in bacteria.",
