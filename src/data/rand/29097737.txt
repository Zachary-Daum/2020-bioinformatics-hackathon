    abstract "Sulfur cathodes in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries still suffer
 from their low electronic conductivity, undesired dissolution of lithium
 polysulfide (Li2S n , 3 </= n </= 8) species into the electrolyte, and large
 degree volume change during the cycle. To overcome these problems, an
 effective encapsulation for the sulfur cathode is necessary. By means of
 particle swarm optimization (PSO) and density functional theory (DFT), we
 have predicted a stable metallic two-dimensional sp (2)-hybridized carbon
 allotrope (DHP-graphene). This carbon sheet can prevent S atoms from cathode
 entering electrolyte. However, Li-ions can shuttle freely due to the
 increasing difference in Li-ions concentration between electrolyte and
 cathode along with the potential difference between cathode and anode during
 charge-discharge cycles. In addition, versatile electronic band structures
 and linear dispersion are found in DHP-graphene nanoribbons but only metallic
 band structure occurs for DHP-graphene nanotubes.",
