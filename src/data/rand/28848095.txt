    abstract "BACKGROUND: Older people with more negative attitudes to ageing
 are at increased risk of several adverse outcomes, including decline in
 physical function and increased difficulties with activities of daily living.
 OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether negative attitudes to ageing increase the
 risk of the onset or progression of frailty. METHOD: Participants were 3,505
 men and women aged 60 years and over from the English Longitudinal Study of
 Ageing. They completed a 12-item questionnaire on attitudes to ageing.
 Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine the structure of these items,
 and a single factor was derived which we labelled ""physical and
 psychological loss."" Frailty was assessed by the Fried phenotype of physical
 frailty at waves 2 and 4, and by a frailty index at waves 2-5. RESULTS:
 Having a more positive attitude to ageing as regards ""physical and
 psychological loss"" was associated with a decreased risk of becoming
 physically frail or pre-frail at follow-up. For a standard deviation
 increment in score, the relative risk ratios (95% confidence interval),
 adjusted for age, sex and baseline level of physical frailty, were 0.86
 (0.79, 0.94) for pre-frailty and 0.72 (0.63, 0.83) for frailty. Further
 adjustment for other potential confounding variables had only slight
 attenuating effects on these associations: multivariable-adjusted relative
 risk ratios were 0.89 (0.81, 0.98) for pre-frailty and 0.78 (0.68, 0.91) for
 frailty. Attitude to ageing was not associated with change in the frailty
 index over time after adjustment for potential confounding variables.
 CONCLUSION: Older people who have a more positive attitude to ageing are at
 reduced risk of becoming physically frail or pre-frail. Future research needs
 to replicate this finding and discover the underlying mechanisms. Attitude to
 ageing was not a risk factor for change in the more broadly defined frailty
 index.",
