    abstract "Background: Physical exercise is a systematic sequence of
 movements executed with a predefined purpose. This muscular activity impacts
 not only on circulatory adaptations, but also neuronal integration with the
 potential to influence cognition. The aim of this review was to determine
 whether the literature supports the idea that physical exercise promotes
 cognitive benefits in healthy adults. Methods: A systematic search for
 relevant articles was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items
 for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis criteria using available databases
 (PubMed, LILACS, Scopus, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, OpenGrey,
 Google Scholar and CENTRAL). The search terms included ""humans"" or ""adults
"" or ""cognition"" or ""awareness"" or ""cognitive dissonance"" or ""cognitiv
e reserve"" or ""comprehension"" or ""consciousness"" and ""motor activity""
 or ""exercise"" or ""physical fitness,"" and not ""aged"" or ""nervous system
 diseases,"" with the purpose of finding associations between moderate
 physical exercise and cognition. A methodological quality and risk of bias
 unit assessed the eligibility of articles. Results: A total of 7179 articles
 were identified. Following review and quality assessment, three articles were
 identified to fulfill the inclusion criteria. An association between moderate
 physical exercise and cognition was observed. Improvements in cognitive
 parameters such as reduced simple reaction time, improved response precision
 and working memory were identified among the included articles. Conclusion:
 This systematic review found that moderate physical exercise improves
 cognition.",
