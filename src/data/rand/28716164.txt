    abstract "BACKGROUND: Multi-layer reconstruction has become standard in
 endoscopic skull base surgery. The inlay component used can vary among
 autografts, allografts, xenografts and synthetics, primarily based on surgeon
 preference. The short- and long-term outcomes of collagen matrix in skull
 base reconstruction are described. METHODS: A case series of patients who
 underwent endoscopic skull base reconstruction with collagen matrix inlay
 were assessed. Immediate peri-operative outcomes (cerebrospinal fluid leak,
 meningitis, ventriculitis, intracranial bleeding, epistaxis, seizures) and
 delayed complications (delayed healing, meningoencephalocele, prolapse of
 reconstruction, delayed cerebrospinal fluid leak, ascending meningitis) were
 examined. RESULTS: Of 120 patients (51.0 +/- 17.5 years, 41.7 per cent
 female), peri-operative complications totalled 12.7 per cent (cerebrospinal
 fluid leak, 3.3 per cent; meningitis, 3.3 per cent; other intracranial
 infections, 2.5 per cent; intracranial bleeding, 1.7 per cent; epistaxis, 1.7
 per cent; and seizures, 0 per cent). Delayed complications did not occur in
 any patients. CONCLUSION: Collagen matrix is an effective inlay material. It
 provides robust long-term separation between sinus and cranial cavities, and
 avoids donor site morbidity, but carries additional cost.",
