    abstract "Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are the gold
 standard for evaluating a novel therapeutic agent. In some instances, it may
 not be considered ethical or desirable to complete a placebo-controlled
 clinical trial and, instead, the placebo is replaced by an active comparator
 with the objective of showing either superiority or non-inferiority to the
 active comparator. In a non-inferiority trial, the experimental treatment is
 considered non-inferior if it retains a pre-specified proportion of the
 effect of the active comparator as represented by the non-inferiority margin.
 A key assumption required for valid inference in the non-inferiority setting
 is the constancy assumption, which requires that the effect of the active
 comparator in the non-inferiority trial is consistent with the effect that
 was observed in previous trials. It has been shown that violations of the
 constancy assumption can result in a dramatic increase in the rate of
 incorrectly concluding non-inferiority in the presence of ineffective or even
 harmful treatment. In this paper, we illustrate how Bayesian hierarchical
 modeling can be used to facilitate multi-source smoothing of the data from
 the current trial with the data from historical studies, enabling direct
 probabilistic evaluation of the constancy assumption. We then show how this
 result can be used to adapt the non-inferiority margin when the constancy
 assumption is violated and present simulation results illustrating that our
 method controls the type-I error rate when the constancy assumption is
 violated, while retaining the power of the standard approach when the
 constancy assumption holds. We illustrate our adaptive procedure using a
 non-inferiority trial of raltegravir, an antiretroviral drug for the
 treatment of HIV.",
