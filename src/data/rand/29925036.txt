    abstract "Lignin is one of the major components of lignocellulose biomass
 and chemically degrades into phenolic aldehydes including
 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and syringaldehyde. No lipid accumulation
 from the phenolic aldehydes by oleaginous microbes had been succeeded.
 Compared with vanillin and syringaldehyde, T. cutaneum ACCC 20271 have better
 tolerance to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde was found to be
 able as the substrate for lipid accumulation, while vanillin and
 syringaldehyde were only converted to less toxic phenolic alcohols and acids
 without observable lipid accumulation, perhaps due to the space shelling of
 methoxyl group(s) in the structures. A long term fed batch fermentation of
 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde accumulated 0.85g L(-1) of lipid, equivalent to 0.039g
 lipid per gram of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde substrate, approximately 3.7 folds
 greater than the control without 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde addition. The fatty
 acid composition well met the need for biodiesel synthesis. The preliminary
 pathway from 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde to lipid was predicted. This study took
 the first experimental trial on utilizing phenolic aldehydes as the sole
 carbon sources for microbial lipid accumulation by T. cutaneum ACCC 20271.",
