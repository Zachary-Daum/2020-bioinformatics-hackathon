    abstract "Augmented renal clearance (ARC) is being increasingly described
 in neurocritical care practice. The mechanisms driving this phenomenon are
 largely unknown. The aim of this project was therefore to explore changes in
 renal function, cardiac output (CO), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
 concentrations in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI). This
 prospective observational cohort study was conducted in a tertiary-level,
 university-affiliated intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with normal plasma
 creatinine concentrations (<120 mumol/L) at admission and no history of
 chronic kidney disease, admitted with isolated TBI, were eligible for
 enrollment. Continuous CO measures were obtained using arterial pulse
 waveform analysis. Eight-hour urinary creatinine clearances (CLCR) were used
 to quantify renal function. ANP concentrations in plasma were measured on
 alternate days. Data were collected from study enrollment until ICU
 discharge, death, or day 15, which ever came first. Eleven patients,
 contributing 100 ICU days of physiological data, were enrolled into the
 study. Most participants were young men, requiring mechanical ventilation.
 Median ICU length of stay was 9.6 [7.8-13.0] days. Elevated CLCR measures
 (>150 mL/min) were frequent and appeared to parallel changes in CO. Plasma
 ANP concentrations were also significantly elevated over the study period
 (minimum value = 243 pg/mL). These data suggest that ARC is likely to
 complicate the care of TBI patients with normal plasma creatinine
 concentrations, and may be driven by associated cardiovascular changes and/or
 elevated plasma ANP concentrations. However, significant additional research
 is required to further understand these findings.",
