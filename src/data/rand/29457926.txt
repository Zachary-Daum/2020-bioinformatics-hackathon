    abstract "BACKGROUND: Interprofessional curricula have often lacked
 explicit reference to theory despite calls for a more theoretically informed
 field that illuminates curricular assumptions and justifies curricular
 practices. AIM: To review the contributions of theory to the design,
 delivery, and evaluation of interprofessional curricula. METHODS: Four
 databases were searched (1988-2015). Studies demonstrating explicit and a
 high-quality contribution of theory to the design, delivery or evaluation of
 interprofessional curricula were included. Data were extracted against a
 comprehensive framework of curricular activities and a narrative synthesis
 undertaken. RESULTS: Ninety-one studies met the inclusion criteria. The
 majority of studies (86%) originated from the UK, USA, and Canada. Theories
 most commonly underpinned ""learning activities"" (47%) and ""evaluation""
 (54%). Theories of reflective learning, identity formation, and contact
 hypothesis dominated the field though there are many examples of innovative
 theoretical contributions. CONCLUSIONS: Theories contribute considerably to
 the interprofessional field, though many curricular elements remain
 under-theorized. The literature offers no ""gold standard"" theory for
 interprofessional curricula; rather theoretical selection is contingent upon
 the curricular component to which theory is to be applied. Theories
 contributed to interprofessional curricula by explaining, predicting,
 organizing or illuminating social processes embedded in interprofessional
 curricular assumptions. This review provides guidance how theory might be
 robustly and appropriately deployed in the design, delivery, and evaluation
 of interprofessional curricula.",
