    abstract "This paper deals with the photochemical fate of two
 representative carbapenem antibiotics, namely imipenem and meropenem, in
 aqueous solutions under solar radiation. The analytical method employed for
 the determination of the target compounds in various aqueous matrices, such
 as ultrapure water, municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents, and river
 water, at environmentally relevant concentrations, was liquid chromatography
 coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry. The
 absorption spectra of both compounds were measured in aqueous solutions at pH
 values from 6 to 8, and both compounds showed a rather strong absorption band
 centered at about 300 nm, while their molar absorption coefficient was in the
 order from 9 x 10(3)-10(4) L mol(-1) cm(-1). The kinetics of the
 photochemical degradation of the target compounds was studied in aqueous
 solutions under natural solar radiation in a solar reactor with compound
 parabolic collectors. It was found that the photochemical degradation of both
 compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations follows first order
 kinetics and the quantum yield was in the order of 10(-3) mol einsten(-1).
 Several parameters were studied, such as solution pH, the presence of nitrate
 ions and humic acids, and the effect of water matrix. In all cases, it was
 found that the presence of various organic and inorganic constituents in the
 aqueous matrices do not contribute significantly, either positively or
 negatively, to the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural
 solar radiation. In a final set of photolysis experiments, the effect of the
 level of irradiance was studied under simulated solar radiation and it was
 found that the quantum yield for the direct photodegradation of both
 compounds remained practically constant by changing the incident solar
 irradiance from 28 to 50 W m(-2).",
