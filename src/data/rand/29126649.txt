    abstract "PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of dose de-escalation in a large
 series of resected limbs soft tissue sarcomas (STS). METHODS: Data were
 retrospectively analysed from 414 consecutive patients treated for limb STS
 by enlarged surgery and radiotherapy at Gustave Roussy from 05/1993 to
 05/2012. Radiotherapy (RT) dose level was decided by the multidisciplinary
 staff and depended upon the quality of surgery and margins size. RESULTS: RT
 was delivered prior (13%) or after (87%) surgery. Seven patients (2%) had
 pre- and a postoperative RT boost. Median delivered RT dose was 50Gy
 (36-70Gy), and 33% received >/=55Gy. At a median follow-up of 6.8years, the
 5-year actuarial local relapse (LR) rate was 7% (95% CI: 4.4-10%). The median
 time to the first LR was 2.7years (range: 0.6-11.2years). The LR was most
 often located within the irradiated field (26/32; 81%), where the median
 total applied dose was 56Gy (range, 40-60Gy). The 5-year LR rates were 4%,
 and 15% in patients receiving <55Gy, and in those who had >/=55Gy (p<0.001),
 respectively. In the multivariate analysis, dose >/=55Gy (HR [hazard ratio]:
 2.9; p=0.02), certain histological subtypes (HR: 7.8; p<0.001), and minimal
 surgical margins <1mm (HR: 2.9; p=0.02) were associated to higher LR rates.
 In the subgroup of patients with ""positive"" margins <1mm (n=102), these
 histological subtypes (HR: 4.4; p=0.03), and inadequate initial surgery
 justifying re-excision (HR: 3; p=0.048) predicted for an increased LR,
 whereas dose of irradiation did not (p=0.2). Patients who had late
 complications (n=64; 15%) received higher doses of irradiation as compared
 with other patients (median: 55Gy vs. 50Gy, respectively; p<0.001).
 CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis of patients having enlarged
 surgery and RT, histological subtype is the strongest predictor of LR,
 whereas dose de-escalation did not lead to worse outcomes. A dose of 50Gy may
 be recommended in case of planned enlarged surgery with R0 margins.",
