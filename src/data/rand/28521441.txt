    abstract "Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in
 males. Heterogeneous genomic aberrations may lead to prostate cancer onset,
 progression and metastasis. This heterogeneity also contributes to the
 variety in cancer risk and outcomes, different drug responses and
 progression, observed between individual patients. Classical prognostic
 factors, including prostate-specific antigen, Gleason Score and clinical
 tumor staging, are not sufficient to portray the complexity of a clinically
 relevant cancer diagnosis, risk prognosis, treatment choice and therapy
 monitoring. There is a requirement for novel genetic biomarkers in order to
 understand the oncogenic heterogeneity in a patient-personalized clinical
 setting and to improve the efficacy of risk prognosis and treatment choice. A
 number of biomarkers and gene panels have been established from patient
 sample cohort studies. These previous studies have provided distinct
 information to the investigation of heterogeneous malignancy in prostate
 cancer, which aids in clinical decision-making. Biomarker-guided therapies
 may facilitate the effective selection of drugs during early treatment;
 therefore, are beneficial to the individual patient. A non-invasive approach
 allows for convenient and repeated sampling to screen for cancer and monitor
 treatment response without the requirement for invasive tissue biopsies. With
 the current availability of numerous advanced technologies, reliable
 detection of the minimal tumor residues present following treatment may
 become clinical practice and, therefore, inform further in the field of
 personalized medicine.",
