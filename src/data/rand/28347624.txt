    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To synthesise research findings regarding the
 efficacy and safety of normal saline instillation (NSI) during endotracheal
 suction in the paediatric intensive care unit. DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane
 Library, PROSPERO, the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and
 Dissemination, PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
 (CINAHL) databases were systematically searched. Subject headings included 
""suctioning, endotracheal"", ""suction"", ""sodium chloride"", ""normal
 saline"" and ""paediatrics"". Additional references were sourced from hand
 searches of journal article reference lists and Google Scholar. METHOD: An
 integrative, systematic approach was used to qualitatively synthesise study
 results in the context of paediatric intensive care nursing practice. Data
 were extracted using a standardised data extraction form. Quality assessment
 was performed independently by two reviewers. RESULTS: Three studies met
 pre-defined inclusion criteria. Quality of all study methods was 75% on the
 Mixed Method Appraisal Tool, although reporting quality varied. Overall,
 there was a scarcity of high quality evidence examining NSI and paediatric
 endotracheal suction. Outcome measures included oxygen saturation (SpO2),
 serious adverse events (author/s defined) and ventilation parameters
 (author/s defined). Endotracheal suction with NSI was associated with a
 transient decrease in blood oxygen saturation; research protocols did not
 include interventions to mitigate alveolar derecruitment. Studies were not
 powered to detect differences in endotracheal tube (ETT) occlusion or
 ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). CONCLUSION: NSI was associated with a
 transient decrease in oxygen saturation. In children with obstructive mucous,
 NSI may have a positive effect. Practices which maximise secretion removal
 and mitigate the negative physiological interactions of ETS have been poorly
 evaluated in the paediatric population. High quality, powered, clinical
 trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of normal saline
 instillation and to inform clinical practice.",
