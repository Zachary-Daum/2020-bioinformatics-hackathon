    abstract "The elimination of infected or tumor cells by direct lysis is a
 key T and NK cell effector function. T and NK cells can kill target cells by
 coordinated secretion of cytotoxic granules containing one or both
 pore-forming proteins, perforin and granulysin and combinations of granzyme
 (Gzm) family effector proteases (in humans: Gzm A, B, K, M and H).
 Understanding the pattern of expression of cytotoxic molecules and the
 relationship to different states of T and NK cells may have direct relevance
 for immune responses in autoimmunity, infectious disease and cancer.
 Approaches capable of simultaneously evaluating expression of multiple
 cytotoxic molecules with detailed information on T and NK differentiation
 state, however, remain limited. Here, we established a high dimensional mass
 cytometry approach to comprehensively interrogate single cell proteomic
 expression of cytotoxic programs and lymphocyte differentiation. This assay
 identified a coordinated expression pattern of cytotoxic molecules linked to
 CD8 T cell differentiation stages. Coordinated high expression of perforin,
 granulysin, Gzm A, Gzm B and Gzm M was associated with markers of late
 effector memory differentiation and expression of chemokine receptor CX3CR1.
 However, classical gating and dimensionality reduction approaches also
 identified other discordant patterns of cytotoxic molecule expression in CD8
 T cells, including reduced perforin, but high Gzm A, Gzm K and Gzm M
 expression. When applied to non-CD8 T cells, this assay identified different
 patterns of cytotoxic molecule co-expression by CD56(hi) versus CD56(dim)
 defined NK cell developmental stages; in CD4 T cells, low expression of
 cytotoxic molecules was found mainly in TH1 phenotype cells, but not in Tregs
 or T follicular helper cells (TFH). Thus, this comprehensive, single cell,
 proteomic assessment of cytotoxic protein co-expression patterns demonstrates
 specialized cytotoxic programs in T cells and NK cells linked to their
 differentiation stages. Such comprehensive cytotoxic profiling may identify
 distinct patterns of cytotoxic potential relevant for specific infections,
 autoimmunity or tumor settings.",
