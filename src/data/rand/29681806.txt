    abstract "The present study used the presentation of food pictures and
 judgements about their duration to assess the emotions elicited by food in
 women suffering from an eating disorder (ED). Twenty-three women diagnosed
 with an ED, namely anorexia (AN) or bulimia nervosa (BN), and 23 healthy
 controls (HC) completed a temporal bisection task and a duration
 discrimination task. Intervals were marked with emotionally pre-rated
 pictures of joyful and disgusting food, and pictures of neutral objects. The
 results showed that, in the bisection task, AN women overestimated the
 duration of food pictures in comparison to neutral ones. Also, compared to
 participants with BN, they perceived the duration of joyful food pictures as
 longer, and tended to overestimate the duration of the disgusting ones. These
 effects on perceived duration suggest that AN women experienced an intense
 reaction of fear when they were confronted to food pictures. More precisely,
 by having elevated the arousal level and activated the defensive system, food
 pictures seemed to have speeded up the rhythm of the AN participants'
 internal clock, which led to an overestimation of images' duration. In
 addition, the results revealed that, in both tasks, ED women presented a
 lower temporal sensitivity than HC, which was related to their ED
 symptomatology (i.e., BMI, restraint and concern) and, particularly, to their
 weaker cognitive abilities in terms of attention, processing speed and
 working memory. Considered all together, the findings of the present
 experiment highlight the role of fear and anxiety in the manifestations of AN
 and point out the importance of considering non-temporal factors in the
 interpretation of time perception performance.",
