    abstract "Creatine supplementation during resistance training has
 potential beneficial effects on properties of bone in aging adults. We
 systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the
 effect of creatine supplementation combined with resistance training on bone
 mineral density (BMD) in aging adults. We searched PubMed and SPORTDiscus
 databases and included RCTs of >/=3 months duration that examined the
 combined effect of creatine and resistance training on bone mineral in adults
 >50 years of age or postmenopausal. Meta-analyses were performed when
 applicable trials were available on whole body and clinically important bone
 sites. Five trials met inclusion criteria with a total of 193 participants.
 Two of the studies reported significant benefits of creatine supplementation
 and resistance training compared to resistance training alone on bone.
 Meta-analyses revealed no greater effect of creatine and resistance training
 compared to resistance training alone on whole body BMD (MD: 0.00, 95% CI
 -0.01 to 0.01, p = 0.50), hip BMD (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01, p = 0.26),
 femoral neck BMD (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01, p = 0.71), and lumbar spine
 BMD (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03, p = 0.32). In conclusion, there is a
 limited number of RCTs examining the effects of creatine supplementation and
 resistance training on BMD in older adults. Our meta-analyses revealed no
 significant effect on whole body, hip, femoral neck, or lumbar spine BMD when
 comparing creatine and resistance training to resistance training alone.
 Future longer term (>12 month) trials with higher resistance training
 frequencies (>/=3 times per week) is warranted.",
