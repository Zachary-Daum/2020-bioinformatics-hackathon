    abstract "Novel nanocomposite hydrogel was synthesized based on
 kappa-carrageenan and nano-silver chloride by a simple method and applied for
 the removal of cationic dyes in aqueous solution. Inclusion of nano-silver
 chloride into the superabsorbent hydrogel was utilized for producing the
 effective dye absorbent. The dye absorption was more than 98% after 5min in a
 10ppm aqueous solution at pH=6. The nanocomposite hydrogel was characterized
 by FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, TGA/DTG, and BET analysis. The absorption of
 crystal violet was investigated by changing the absorbent dosage, contact
 time, dye concentration, pH, and temperature. Several kinetic models were
 used to predict the kinetic behavior of the dye absorption. The best result
 was obtained with the pseudo-second order model. The results demonstrated
 that the Temkin model has been fitted better than the other models. The
 reusability experiments showed that the superabsorbent retained more than 60%
 of initial activity after 9 cycles.",
