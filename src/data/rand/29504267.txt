    abstract "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer (LC) is the most common malignancy in
 the world. Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be
 associated with LC; however, the function of KCNQ1OT1 in LC requires
 exploration. METHODS: We conducted in silico analysis with data from The
 Cancer Genome Atlas to investigate the association between KCNQ1OT1 and LC. A
 Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to analyze the function of KCNQ1OT1 on LC
 patient prognosis. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was
 performed to confirm previous results. An A549 lung cancer cell was
 transfected with pcDNA-KCNQ1OT1, and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay was
 performed to investigate the function of KCNQ1OT1 on cell proliferation. in
 vivo assay was performed with nude mice. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis and
 qRT-PCR indicated that KCNQ1OT1 expression was higher in stage I LC patients
 (P < 0.01), and survival analysis showed that high expression of KCNQ1OT1 in
 LC patients was associated with better prognosis (P < 0.05). qRT-PCR showed a
 negative correlation between KCNQ1OT1 and Ki67 expression and tumor size (P <
 0.01), which indicated that KCNQ1OT1 is associated with tumor growth in LC.
 There was no significant correlation between KCNQ1OT1 level and lymph node
 metastasis (P > 0.05). KCNQ1OT1 overexpression significantly inhibited cell
 proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION:
 Our preliminary data showed that KCNQ1OT1 is overexpressed in early stage LC
 and is correlated with better prognosis in LC patients, possibly by
 suppressing cell proliferation.",
