    abstract "BACKGROUND: Management of alopecia areata (AA) and androgenetic
 alopecia (AGA) is often challenging. The use of carboxytherapy may be a novel
 therapeutic option for such cases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical
 efficacy and safety of carboxytherapy in alopecia areata and androgenetic
 alopecia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 80 patients with
 alopecia divided into two groups; Group I included 40 AA patients (Group IA
 received carboxytherapy and Group IB control received placebo), and Group II
 included 40 AGA patients (Group IIA received carboxytherapy and Group IIB
 control received placebo), and followed up monthly for 3 months. They were
 evaluated clinically (by assessment of Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score
 in group I, and Sinclair scale and Norwood-Hamilton scale in group II), by
 dermoscopy and digital dermoscopy at each visit. RESULTS: Group IA patients
 showed significant clinical improvement in SALT score and dermoscopic
 improvement after carboxytherapy and at the end of follow-up period with
 significant reduction in dystrophic hair, black dots, yellow dots, and
 tapered hair coinciding with significant emergence of regrowing hair. Group
 IIA patients showed significant clinical and dermoscopic improvement after
 carboxytherapy with significant increase in hair density measured by digital
 dermoscopy. However, regression of these results was observed during the
 follow-up period but was still significantly better than before treatment.
 There were statistically significant improvements in clinical score, global
 assessments, dermoscopic, and digital dermoscopic findings in both group IA
 and group IIA received carboxytherapy in comparison with group IB and group
 IIB received placebo injections, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carboxytherapy
 seems to be a promising therapeutic option for patchy AA and could be helpful
 as an adjuvant therapy of AGA but more than 6 sessions are required and
 adjuvants are recommended for maintenance of the results.",
