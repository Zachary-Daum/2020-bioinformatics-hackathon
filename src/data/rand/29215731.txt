    abstract "This study was conducted to investigate whether eucalyptol plays
 a role in influencing bacterial growth in cigarette smoke-exposed lungs. Rats
 were exposed to air (control) and cigarette smoke (smoking) in the presence
 and absence of eucalyptol (260 mg/day). Morphological analysis of lung
 structures and status of airway mucous production were observed under
 microscope. Pathological changes of ciliated columnar epithelium in airways
 were examined using transmission electron microscopy. MUC5AC protein and
 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and
 lungs were determined. Application of eucalyptol reduced pulmonary bullae
 formation and airway mucus overproduction in the smoke-exposed lungs.
 Treatment with eucalyptol attenuated ciliated cell damage in cigarette
 smoke-exposed lungs. Bacterial colonies of lungs were obviously lower in the
 eucalyptol-treated rats than that in the smoking rats (p < 0.01). Treatment
 with eucalyptol reduced the counts of bacterial colonization residing in the
 challenged lungs (p < 0.01). Application of eucalyptol not only decreased
 MUC5AC protein expression in BALF and tobacco-exposed lungs but also
 suppressed its mRNA expression in the lungs (all p < 0.05). Intervention of
 eucalyptol benefits elimination of bacterial organisms from tobacco-exposed
 lungs through attenuating ciliated cell damage and suppressing MUC5AC
 expression in the lungs.",
