    abstract "RS-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol (rhododendrol, RD), a
 skin-whitening agent, is known to induce leukoderma in some consumers. To
 explore the mechanism underlying this effect, we previously showed that the
 oxidation of RD with mushroom or human tyrosinase produces cytotoxic quinone
 oxidation products and RD-eumelanin exerts a potent pro-oxidant activity.
 Cellular antioxidants were oxidized by RD-eumelanin with a concomitant
 production of H2 O2 . In this study, we examined whether this pro-oxidant
 activity of RD-eumelanin is enhanced by ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation because
 most RD-induced leukoderma lesions are found in sun-exposed areas. Exposure
 to a physiological level of UVA (3.5 mW/cm(2) ) induced a two to fourfold
 increase in the rates of oxidation of GSH, cysteine, ascorbic acid, and NADH.
 This oxidation was oxygen-dependent and was accompanied by the production of
 H2 O2 . These results suggest that RD-eumelanin is cytotoxic to melanocytes
 through its potent pro-oxidant activity that is enhanced by UVA radiation.",
