    abstract "Cationic lipids have become known as one of the most versatile
 tools for the delivery of DNA, RNA and many other therapeutic molecules, and
 are especially attractive because they can be easily designed, synthesized
 and characterized. Most of cationic lipids share the common structure of
 cationic head groups and hydrophobic portions with linker bonds between both
 domains. The linker bond is an important determinant of the chemical
 stability and biodegradability of cationic lipid, and further governs its
 transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity. Based on the structures of linker
 bonds, they can be grouped into many types, such as ether, ester, amide,
 carbamate, disulfide, urea, acylhydrazone, phosphate, and other unusual types
 (carnitine, vinyl ether, ketal, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, malonic acid
 diamide and dihydroxybenzene). This review summarizes some research results
 concerning the nature (such as the structure and orientation of linker
 groups) and density (such as the spacing and the number of linker groups) of
 linker bond for improving the chemical stability, biodegradability,
 transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity of cationic lipid to overcome the
 critical barriers of in vitro and in vivo transfection.",
