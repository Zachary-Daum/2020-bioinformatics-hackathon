    abstract "Large amounts of data emerging from experiments in molecular
 medicine are leading to the identification of molecular signatures associated
 with disease subtypes. The contextualization of these patterns is important
 for obtaining mechanistic insight into the aberrant processes associated with
 a disease, and this typically involves the integration of multiple
 heterogeneous types of data. In this review, we discuss knowledge
 representations that can be useful to explore the biological context of
 molecular signatures, in particular three main approaches, namely, pathway
 mapping approaches, molecular network centric approaches and approaches that
 represent biological statements as knowledge graphs. We discuss the utility
 of each of these paradigms, illustrate how they can be leveraged with
 selected practical examples and identify ongoing challenges for this field of
 research.",
