    abstract "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sophora alopecuroides L., a
 traditional Chinese herb, has been widely used to treat numerous diseases
 throughout China. Quinolizidine alkaloids were identified as active
 components in Sophora alopecuroides L., and Sophoridine (SRI) is the major
 component in the Quinolizidine alkaloids. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate
 the toxic effects of SRI in rat liver BRL-3A cells and to explore potential
 ROS-related mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability, cytotoxicity,
 apoptosis, intracellular generation of ROS, GSH/GSSG ratio and levels of
 proteins in mitochondria apoptosis pathway were analyzed. RESULTS: Our data
 indicated that SRI could suppress BRL-3A cells viability in a concentration-
 and time-dependent manner and increase cytotoxicity, ROS accumulation and
 cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Expressions and
 activities of apoptotic related proteins were upregulated, whereas expression
 of Bcl-2 was downregulated after treatment. Furthermore, level of H2O2 was
 increased, whereas level of Superoxide was not changed after treatment.
 Moreover, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine reversed SRI-induced apoptosis and
 ROS accumulation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that SRI promotes rat liver
 BRL-3A cells apoptosis by increasing intracellular ROS accumulation.",
