    abstract "The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during alkaline water
 electrolysis is the bottleneck of water splitting. Perovskite materials have
 been particularly proposed as good and economically reasonable
 electrocatalysts for the OER, showing promise and advantages with respect to
 classic metallic electrodes. However, the degradation of perovskites during
 catalysis limits their service lifetime. Recently, the material
 BaCo0.98Ti0.02O3-delta:Co3O4 was shown to be electrocatalytically and
 chemically stable during water electrolysis even under industrially relevant
 conditions. The lifetime of this perovskite-based system is prolonged by a
 factor of 10 in comparison to that of Pr0.2Ba0.8CoO3-delta and is comparable
 to that of industrially applied electrodes. Here we report on the degradation
 kinetics of several OER catalysts at room temperature, comparatively studied
 by monitoring the oxygen evolution at microelectrodes. A decrease in the
 reaction rate within a maximum of 60 s is observed, which is related to
 chemical and/or structural changes at the oxide surface.",
