    abstract "BACKGROUND: The long-acting injectable antipsychotic
 aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg (AOM 400) was recently approved for
 maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (BP-I). The purpose of this study
 was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AOM 400 as
 long-term maintenance treatment for BP-I. METHODS: This open-label
 multicenter study evaluated the effectiveness of AOM 400 as maintenance
 treatment for BP-I by assessing safety and tolerability (primary objective)
 and efficacy (secondary objective). The study enrolled AOM 400-naive (""de
 novo"") patients as well as AOM 400-experienced (""rollover"") patients with
 BP-I from a lead-in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that
 demonstrated the efficacy of AOM 400 in the maintenance treatment of BP-I
 (Calabrese et al. in J Clin Psychiatry 78:324-331, 2017). Safety variables
 included frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
 and TEAEs resulting in study discontinuation. Efficacy was assessed by the
 proportion of patients maintaining stability throughout the maintenance
 phase, as well as mean changes from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale
 (YMRS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and Clinical Global
 Impressions for Bipolar Disorder-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-BP-S) total
 scores. Patient acceptability and tolerability of treatment was assessed
 using the Patient Satisfaction with Medication Questionnaire-Modified.
 RESULTS: Of 464 patients entering the maintenance phase, 379 (82%) were de
 novo and 85 (18%) were rollover. TEAEs were more common in de novo than
 rollover patients. The overall discontinuation rate due to TEAEs was 10.3%
 (48/464). Improvements in YMRS and CGI-BP-S total scores were maintained
 during the study, and the vast majority of both de novo (87.0%) and rollover
 (97.6%) patients maintained stability through their last visit. Overall, the
 need for rescue medication during the maintenance phase was minimal (< 10% of
 patients). Patient satisfaction levels were high, with both de novo and
 rollover patients rating the side effect burden of AOM 400 as greatly
 improved relative to previous medications. CONCLUSION: AOM 400 was safe,
 effective, and well tolerated by both de novo and AOM 400-experienced
 patients with BP-I for long-term maintenance treatment. Trial registration
