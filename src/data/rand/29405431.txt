    abstract "Advancement of coronary interventions and portable hemodynamic
 device requires placement of large bore sheaths. Access for large caliber
 sheaths, its placement, maintenance, and hemostasis is very challenging and
 one of the key ailments for successful procedures. Traditional hemostasis
 method is manual compression, which is unattractive due to its own
 limitations and subsequent complications. Single closure device for sheath
 size larger than 8 French (Fr) is not available. We performed retrospective
 analysis of large cohort of patients with 13, 14 Fr sheaths (Impella device
 [ABIOMED]) percutaneous closure with the use of two Perclose devices. Two
 perclose devices were placed in a ""Preclose"" fashion and hemostasis was
 obtained few days later once hemodynamic support was weaned off by deployment
 of perclose sutures.",
