    abstract "Previous preclinical studies have shown that nicotine
 pretreatment during adolescence increases the reinforcing actions of cocaine.
 However, little is known about the effect of prior nicotine administration on
 cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and its reinstatement in
 adult mice. Besides, little information is available regarding the role of
 sex in this cross-talk between nicotine and cocaine. Thus, we examined if
 nicotine administration during adulthood would differentially alter
 cocaine-induced CPP, its extinction and reinstatement in male versus female
 mice and if the dose of nicotine was important in this regard. To this end,
 mice were pretreated with saline or nicotine (0.25 or 1mg/kg; twice daily for
 seven days) and then tested for place preference before and after single and
 repeated conditioning with cocaine (15mg/kg). Mice were then exposed to
 extinction training and tested for reinstatement of CPP. Our results showed
 that male and female mice pretreated with saline and conditioned with cocaine
 each exhibited a robust CPP after a single cocaine conditioning. However,
 this response was blunted in mice pretreated with the lower but not higher
 dose of nicotine. Female mice pretreated with the lower dose nicotine also
 failed to show CPP after repeated conditioning. Reinstatement of
 cocaine-induced CPP was also blunted in these mice compared to their
 respective controls. Together, these results suggest that nicotine
 administration during adulthood exerts differential effects on
 cocaine-induced CPP and its reinstatement in male and female mice and the
 dose of nicotine is important in this regard.",
