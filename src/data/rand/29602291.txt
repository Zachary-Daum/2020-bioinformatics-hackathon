    abstract "This study aimed to evaluate neuromuscular activation in the
 scalene and sternocleidomastoid muscles using surface electromyography (EMG)
 during progressively increased inspiratory flow, produced by increasing the
 respiratory rate under inspiratory-resistive loading using a mask ventilator.
 Moreover, we attempted to identify the EMG inflection point (EMG(IP)) on the
 graph, at which the root mean square (RMS) of the EMG signal values of the
 inspiratory muscles against the inspiratory flow velocity acceleration
 abruptly increases, similarly to the EMG anaerobic threshold (EMG(AT))
 reported during incremental-resistive loading in other skeletal muscles. We
 measured neuromuscular activation of healthy male subjects and found that the
 inspiratory flow velocity increased by approximately 1.6-fold. We
 successfully observed an increase in RMS that corresponded to inspiratory
 flow acceleration with rho >/= 0.7 (Spearman's rank correlation) in 17 of 27
 subjects who completed the experimental protocol. To identify EMG(IP), we
 analyzed the fitting to either a straight or non-straight line related to the
 increasing inspiratory flow and RMS using piecewise linear spline functions.
 As a result, EMG(IP) was identified in the scalene and sternocleidomastoid
 muscles of 17 subjects. We believe that the identification of EMG(IP) in this
 study infers the existence of EMG(AT) in inspiratory muscles. Application of
 surface EMG, followed by identification of EMG(IP), for evaluating the
 neuromuscular activation of respiratory muscles may be allowed to estimate
 the signs of the respiratory failure, including labored respiration,
 objectively and non-invasively accompanied using accessory muscles in
 clinical respiratory care.",
