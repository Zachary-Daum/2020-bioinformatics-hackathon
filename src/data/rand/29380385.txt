    abstract "OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study was to assess the
 role of l-arginine/SNAP/NO/cGMP/KATP channel pathway in analgesic effects of
 alpha-terpineol in mice. METHODS: Male NMRI mice were pretreated
 intraperitoneally with NO precursor (l-arginine, 100 mg/kg), NO synthase
 inhibitor (l-NAME, 30 mg/kg), NO donor (SNAP, 1 mg/kg), guanylyl cyclase
 inhibitor (methylene blue, 20 mg/kg), PDE inhibitor (sildenafil, 0.5 mg/kg),
 KATP channel blocker (glibenclamide, 10 mg/kg) and naloxone (2 mg/kg) 20 min
 before the administration of alpha-terpineol. The formalin test was performed
 20 min after the administration of alpha-terpineol, and nociceptive responses
 of mice were recorded during 30 min. KEY FINDINGS: A significant and
 dose-dependent antinociception was produced by alpha-terpineol (40 and 80
 mg/kg) in both the phases of formalin test. The antinociceptive effect of
 alpha-terpineol was significantly potentiated by l-arginine in the second
 phase while significantly antagonized by l-NAME in both phases of formalin
 test. Also, SNAP and sildenafil non-significantly enhanced-while methylene
 blue significantly diminished-the antinociceptive effect of alpha-terpineol
 in both phases of formalin test. Glibenclamide significantly reversed the
 alpha-terpineol-induced antinociception, indicating the involvement of KATP
 channels in antinociceptive effect of alpha-terpineol. CONCLUSIONS: These
 results indicate that the antinociceptive effect of alpha-terpineol is
 mediated through l-arginine/SNAP/NO/cGMP/KATP channel pathway.",
