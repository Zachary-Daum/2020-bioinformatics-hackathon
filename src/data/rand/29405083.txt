    abstract "A retrospective population-based observational study using
 cancer registration data of women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer
 between 2006 and 2010, in England, was carried out to explore how different
 morphological subtypes affect survival rates. Age-standardised net survival
 rates by morphological subtype are presented alongside with excess mortality
 modelling accounting for the impact of demographic, diagnostic and tumour
 factors. The three main morphological subtypes (squamous cell carcinoma
 (SCC), adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma) have similar one-year net
 survival rates of approximately 85%. After adjusting for other important
 determinants of survival, there were no differences at five-years amongst the
 three main morphological subtypes, with unadjusted survival rates of 55-65%.
 As expected, women presenting with neuroendocrine tumours had a much poorer
 outcome than other epithelial cervical malignancies, with 1-year survival of
 up to 55%, five-year survival of 34% and excess mortality rates compared to
 SCC varying between 1.9 and 5.9. Impact Statement What is already known on
 this subject: This is the first study on survival by cervical cancer
 morphological subtype using national cancer data. What the results of this
 study add: This study uses excess mortality modelling to investigate the
 effects of the morphological subtypes whilst adjusting the other factors that
 affect cervical cancer survival such as stage, age and grade. What the
 implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further
 research: It is known that cervical neuroendocrine tumours have a poor
 prognosis and this is confirmed by this study. Squamous cell carcinomas
 (SCC), adenocarcinomas (AC) and adenosquamous carcinomas (ASC) have the
 highest net survival and when accounting for other factors there are no
 differences amongst these morphological subtypes in terms of survival.",
