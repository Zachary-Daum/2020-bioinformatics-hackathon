    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) and Immune thrombocytopenic
 purpura (ITP) may occur together as a result of similar autoimmune
 mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of CD in a
 group of ITP patients and in the literature. METHODS: A total of 29 patients
 in Pamukkale University Faculty of Medicine Hospital Pediatric Hematology and
 Oncology Department with ITP were included in the study. Test was performed
 for the antibodies related to CD. Positive result for celiac antibodies was
 confirmed with biopsy. The results were compared with the literature.
 RESULTS: Of the study group, 13 patients (44.8%) were female and 16 (55.2%)
 were male. The mean age was 7.2+/-4.7 years and mean platelet count at the
 time of admission was 13,440+/-11,110/mm(3) (range: 2000-41,000/mm(3)).
 Twelve patients (41.4%) were diagnosed as acute ITP, 6 patients (20.7%) as
 persistent ITP, and 11 patients (37.9%) as chronic ITP, according to the
 duration of thrombocytopenia. Antibody positivity was detected in 1 patient.
 Histological evaluation was compatible with CD. Results were compared with
 studies regarding the prevalence of CD in the population. No significant
 difference was found. CONCLUSION: Although it is not necessary to perform CD
 test in every case of ITP, the presence of differential diagnosis of CD is
 important to prevent unnecessary treatment, especially in ITP patients with
 growth retardation or malabsorption findings.",
