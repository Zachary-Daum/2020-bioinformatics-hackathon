    abstract "The utilization and preparation of functional hybrid films for
 optical sensing applications and membranes is of utmost importance. In this
 work, we report the convenient and scalable preparation of self-crosslinking
 particle-based films derived by directed self-assembly of alkoxysilane-based
 cross-linkers as part of a core-shell particle architecture. The synthesis of
 well-designed monodisperse core-shell particles by emulsion polymerization is
 the basic prerequisite for subsequent particle processing via the melt-shear
 organization technique. In more detail, the core particles consist of
 polystyrene (PS) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), while the comparably
 soft particle shell consists of poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA) and different
 alkoxysilane-based poly(methacrylate)s. For hybrid film formation and
 convenient self-cross-linking, different alkyl groups at the siloxane
 moieties were investigated in detail by solid-state Magic-Angle Spinning
 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS, NMR) spectroscopy revealing different
 crosslinking capabilities, which strongly influence the properties of the
 core or shell particle films with respect to transparency and iridescent
 reflection colors. Furthermore, solid-state NMR spectroscopy and
 investigation of the thermal properties by differential scanning calorimetry
 (DSC) measurements allow for insights into the cross-linking capabilities
 prior to and after synthesis, as well as after the thermally and
 pressure-induced processing steps. Subsequently, free-standing and
 self-crosslinked particle-based films featuring excellent particle order are
 obtained by application of the melt-shear organization technique, as shown by
 microscopy (TEM, SEM).",
