    abstract "Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is widely used to quantify
 developmental instability (DI) in ecological and evolutionary studies. It has
 long been recognized that FA may not exclusively originate from DI for
 sessile organisms such as plants, because phenotypic plasticity in response
 to heterogeneities in the environment might also produce FA. This study
 provides the first empirical evidence for this hypothesis. We reasoned that
 solar irradiance, which is greater on the southern side than on the northern
 side of plants growing in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere,
 would cause systematic morphological differences and asymmetry associated
 with the orientation of plant parts. We used geometric morphometrics to
 characterize the size and shape of flower parts in Iris pumila grown in a
 common garden. The size of floral organs was not significantly affected by
 orientation. Shape and particularly its asymmetric component differed
 significantly according to orientation for three different floral parts.
 Orientation accounted for 10.4% of the total shape asymmetry within flowers
 in the falls, for 11.4% in the standards and for 2.2% in the style branches.
 This indicates that phenotypic plasticity in response to a directed
 environmental factor, most likely solar irradiance, contributes to FA of
 flowers under natural conditions. That FA partly results from phenotypic
 plasticity and not just from DI needs to be considered by studies of FA in
 plants and other sessile organisms.",
