    abstract "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Precise in vivo measurement of deep GM
 volume change is a highly demanded prerequisite for an adequate evaluation of
 disease progression and new treatments. However, quantitative data on the
 reproducibility of deep GM structure volumetry are not yet available. In this
 paper we aim to investigate this reproducibility using a large multicenter
 dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have assessed the reproducibility of 2
 automated segmentation software packages (FreeSurfer and the FMRIB Integrated
 Registration and Segmentation Tool) by quantifying the volume changes of deep
 GM structures by using back-to-back MR imaging scans from the Alzheimer
 Disease Neuroimaging Initiative's multicenter dataset. Five hundred sixty-two
 subjects with scans at baseline and 1 year were included. Reproducibility was
 investigated in the bilateral caudate nucleus, putamen, amygdala, globus
 pallidus, and thalamus by carrying out descriptives as well as multilevel and
 variance component analysis. RESULTS: Median absolute back-to-back
 differences varied between GM structures, ranging from 59.6-156.4 muL for
 volume change, and 1.26%-8.63% for percentage volume change. FreeSurfer had a
 better performance for the outcome of longitudinal volume change for the
 bilateral amygdala, putamen, left caudate nucleus (P < .005), and right
 thalamus (P < .001). For longitudinal percentage volume change, Freesurfer
 performed better for the left amygdala, bilateral caudate nucleus, and left
 putamen (P < .001). Smaller limits of agreement were found for FreeSurfer for
 both outcomes for all GM structures except the globus pallidus. Our results
 showed that back-to-back differences in 1-year percentage volume change were
 approximately 1.5-3.5 times larger than the mean measured 1-year volume
 change of those structures. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal deep GM atrophy
 measures should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, deep GM atrophy
 measurement techniques require substantially improved reproducibility,
 specifically when aiming for personalized medicine.",
