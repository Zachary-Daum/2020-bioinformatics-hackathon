    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of radiographic healing,
 complications, vascularization, and bone density after repair of radial and
 ulnar fractures in dogs <6 kg that were treated with an autogenous cancellous
 bone graft (BG) or free autologous omentum graft (OG). STUDY DESIGN:
 Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with owners/radiologists
 blinded to treatment. ANIMALS: 25 dogs with naturally occurring traumatic
 radial/ulnar fractures. METHODS: Fractures underwent plate fixation with OG
 or BG. Power Doppler ultrasonographic, computed tomographic (CT), and
 radiographic examinations of the affected antebrachium were performed
 preoperatively and every 3 weeks postoperatively until healed.
 Pressure-sensitive walkway gait analysis and owner and veterinarian
 assessments were obtained preoperatively (0 weeks) and 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24
 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: Owner/veterinarian assessments improved
 postoperatively but did not differ significantly between groups. The
 improvement in peak vertical force/vertical impulse was greater in dogs with
 OG than in those with BG, beginning 3 weeks postoperatively. Radiographic
 healing occurred earlier in bones treated with OG (median, 9 weeks) than in
 those treated with BG (12 weeks). Cortical bone density derived from CT of
 the distal ulna was higher in bones with BG compared with bones with OG.
 Signal intensity and the number of vessels in the fracture callus declined
 over time in both groups, according to results of ultrasonography. However,
 bones retained more vessels and greater signal intensity when treated with OG
 compared with treatment with BG, according to multiple views at 6 and 9 weeks
 postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Omental grafting was not associated with major
 complications, and it accelerated bone healing and return to weight bearing
 in dogs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Omental grafting should be considered as an
 adjunct to stabilization of antebrachial fractures in toy and small breed
 dogs.",
