    abstract "BACKGROUND: Residents play a crucial role in out-of-hours
 service. Their perceived readiness for out-of-hours service, however, remains
 underexposed. This national exploratory study assesses whether or not Dutch
 residents feel sufficiently prepared to provide out-of-hours service at the
 time of their first shift, and aims to identify factors influencing perceived
 readiness. METHODS: An online questionnaire focussing on residents' working
 conditions was accessible from 21 September to 10 November 2015. Questions
 targeting perceived readiness for out-of-hours service were presented to all
 responding medical residents actively involved in out-of-hours service.
 Residents who felt sufficiently prepared were compared with residents who did
 not, exploring both individual characteristics and environmental factors.
 RESULTS: A total of 960 residents (mean age 32.5 years +/-; 3.5, 72.4%
 female) from over 30 different medical specialties were included. Thirty-six
 percent of responding residents felt insufficiently prepared to provide
 out-of-hours service at the time of their first shift. Current junior status
 (p = 0.020), prolonged clinical experience prior to the first shift (p <
 0.001), targeted training (p < 0.001), assessment of relevant skills and
 competencies (p < 0.001), and formal consequences following negative
 assessment (p = 0.001) were positively associated with perceived readiness.
 CONCLUSION: One-third of responding residents felt insufficiently prepared
 for their first out-of-hours shift. Our results emphasise the need for
 sufficient time to gain clinical experience as a new graduate, and underline
 the positive contribution of targeted training and assessment of skills and
 competencies relevant to out-of-hours service.",
