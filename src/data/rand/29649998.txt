    abstract "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the
 effectiveness of two diagnostic tests routinely used for diagnosing carpal
 tunnel syndrome (CTS)-ultrasonography (US) and nerve conduction studies
 (NCS)-by comparing their accuracy based on surgical results, with the
 remission of paresthesia as the reference standard. METHODS: We enrolled 115
 patients, all of the female gender with a high probability of a clinical
 diagnosis of CTS. All patients underwent US and NCS for a diagnosis and
 subsequent surgical treatment. As a primary outcome, the accuracy of the US
 and NCS diagnoses was measured by comparing their diagnoses compared with
 those determined by the surgical outcomes. Their accuracy was secondarily
 evaluated based on before and after scores of the Boston Carpal Tunnel
 Questionnaire (BCTQ). RESULTS: Overall, 104 patients (90.4%) were diagnosed
 with CTS by the surgical reference standard, 97 (84.3%) by NCS, and 90
 (78.3%) by US. The concordance of NCS and surgical treatment (p < 0.001;
 kappa = 0.648) was superior to that of US and surgical treatment (p < 0.001;
 kappa = 0.423). The sensitivity and specificity of US and NCS were similar (p
 = 1.000 and p = 0.152, respectively: McNemar's test). The BCTQ scores were
 lower after surgery in patients diagnosed by both US and NCS (p < 0.001and p
 < 0.001, respectively: analysis of variance). CONCLUSIONS: US and NCS
 effectively diagnosed CTS with good sensitivity but were not effective enough
 to rule out a suspicion of CTS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered
 at September, 10 th, 2015, and the registration number was NCT02553811 .",
