    abstract "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this hospital-based, cross-sectional study
 was to examine nurses' knowledge, personal and professional practices and
 attitude towards complementary and alternative medical therapies in urban
 Ghana. METHOD: Using convenience sampling technique, cross-sectional data
 were collected from 210 registered and practicing nurses with
 self-administered questionnaire based on the Complementary and Alternative
 Medicine (CAM) Health Belief Questionnaire (CHBQ). Descriptive statistics and
 the associations between variables were calculated using Pearson's Chi-square
 test and/or Fisher's exact test with p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean score of
 nurses' knowledge on CAM therapies was low (mean +/- SD, 38.39 +/- 10.11;
 possible range, 18-72) which was built on nurses' personal experiences.
 Nurses, therefore, lacked the confidence to recommend CAM therapies to
 patients. Despite the isolated cases of non-herbal supplements, relaxation
 techniques, massage and prayer healing, the study found an overall low
 personal use of CAM (mean +/- SD, 32.97 +/- 10.78; possible range, 18-72)
 among nurses over the last 12 months. Yet, nurses exhibited a positive
 attitude towards CAM (mean +/- SD, 72.7 +/- 12.5, possible range, 67-110). We
 observed significant associations among nurses' CAM knowledge and education
 [chi(2) (2) = 6.69, p = 0.035] and religion [chi(2) (2) = 7.96, p = 0.019];
 nurses' personal use of CAM and income [chi(2) (2) = 16.07, p < 0.001] and
 religion [chi(2) (2) = 18.65, p < 0.001]; and nurses' clinical CAM use and
 income [chi(2) (2) = 7.01, p = 0.030]. CONCLUSION: Despite the overall
 positive attitude towards CAM therapies, Ghanaian nurses do not perceive
 themselves to have sufficient knowledge of CAM. Integrating CAM education
 into the nurses' training curriculum can improve CAM knowledge and
 professional practice among nurses, and in turn, enhance evidence-based
 patient care within the framework of intercultural healthcare system in Ghana.",
