    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Although the introduction of BRAF and MEK
 inhibitors has greatly enhanced treatment possibilities in advanced
 BRAFV600-mutated melanoma, class-related toxicities are rather frequent and
 often involve the eye. Ophthalmologic side effects most commonly include
 central/diffuse serous retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion. Affection of
 the optic nerve head however has not been described clinically. CASE REPORT:
 A 29-year-old man presented in our eye clinic with bilateral blurred vision.
 Seventeen days earlier, he had been started on trametinib and dabrafenib
 combination therapy for metastasized melanoma of unknown origin. Visual field
 testing revealed diffuse bilateral defects, which regressed spontaneously on
 pause of MEK and BRAF inhibitor treatment. DISCUSSION: In addition to the
 widely known class-related retinal toxicity, MEK and BRAF
 inhibitor-associated adverse events may also involve the optic nerve head,
 causing visual field defects probably regressing spontaneously after
 discontinuation of targeted oncologic therapy. In such cases, repeat brain
 imaging and exclusion of melanoma-associated retinopathy is recommended.
 Reinitiation of treatment and subsequent dose escalation seem to be feasible,
 but should be monitored by an ophthalmologist.",
