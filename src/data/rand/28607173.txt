    abstract "Sensory hypersensitivity is a common symptom in autism spectrum
 disorders (ASDs), including fragile X syndrome (FXS), and frequently leads to
 tactile defensiveness. In mouse models of ASDs, there is mounting evidence of
 neuronal and circuit hyperexcitability in several brain regions, which could
 contribute to sensory hypersensitivity. However, it is not yet known whether
 or how sensory stimulation might trigger abnormal sensory processing at the
 circuit level or abnormal behavioral responses in ASD mouse models,
 especially during an early developmental time when experience-dependent
 plasticity shapes such circuits. Using a novel assay, we discovered
 exaggerated motor responses to whisker stimulation in young Fmr1 knock-out
 (KO) mice (postnatal days 14-16), a model of FXS. Adult Fmr1 KO mice actively
 avoided a stimulus that was innocuous to wild-type controls, a sign of
 tactile defensiveness. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3
 barrel cortex neurons expressing GCaMP6s, we found no differences between
 wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice in overall whisker-evoked activity, though 45%
 fewer neurons in young Fmr1 KO mice responded in a time-locked manner.
 Notably, we identified a pronounced deficit in neuronal adaptation to
 repetitive whisker stimulation in both young and adult Fmr1 KO mice. Thus,
 impaired adaptation in cortical sensory circuits is a potential cause of
 tactile defensiveness in autism.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We use a novel
 paradigm of repetitive whisker stimulation and in vivo calcium imaging to
 assess tactile defensiveness and barrel cortex activity in young and adult
 Fmr1 knock-out mice, the mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS). We describe
 evidence of tactile defensiveness, as well as a lack of L2/3 neuronal
 adaptation in barrel cortex, during whisker stimulation. We propose that a
 defect in sensory adaptation within local neuronal networks, beginning at a
 young age and continuing into adulthood, likely contributes to sensory
 overreactivity in FXS and perhaps other ASDs.",
