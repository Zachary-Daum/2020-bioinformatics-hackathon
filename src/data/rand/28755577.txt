    abstract "The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective
 effect of the total flavonoids (TFs) from the leaves of Carya cathayensis
 Sarg. against early development of atherosclerosis. An in vivo model of
 carotid arterial partial ligation was established in mice, and the effects of
 TFs were investigated by morphometric measurements, Cell proliferation
 measurement and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that TFs could
 reduce neointima area by 41%, and the adventitial thickening induced by
 partial ligation was remarkable inhibited by TFs treatment. medial SMCs
 proliferation was significantly inhibited in TFs treated group.
 Immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrated that mice with TFs treatment have
 significant less macrophages accumulation in adventitia. These findings
 indicated that TFs have inhibitory effect in early atherosclerosis lesion
 formation model and strong action on reduce the inflammation in vivo.",
