    abstract "PURPOSE: Currently, no detectors are capable of simultaneously
 measuring dose and linear energy transfer (LET) in real time. In this study,
 we evaluated the feasibility of exploiting the difference in the response of
 various organic plastic scintillation detectors to measure LET and dose in
 therapeutic proton beams. The hypothesis behind this work was that the ratio
 of the responses of different scintillators exposed to the same proton beam
 can be used to obtain a LET vs ratio calibration curve that can then be used
 to infer LET under any other measurement conditions. METHODS: We first used
 similar scintillators with different ionization quenching factors. LET values
 for different irradiation conditions were calculated using a validated Monte
 Carlo model of the proton beam line. The quenching factors in the Birks
 equation for different scintillators as a function of LET were obtained from
 measurements in a 100-MeV pristine proton beam. We then used four different
 organic scintillation materials - polystyrene (BCF-12), poly (methyl
 methacrylate), polyvinyltoluene, and a liquid scintillator - for which the
 LET response varied with regard to not only quenching but also differences in
 material density and relative stopping power. We simultaneously exposed the
 four different organic scintillators and a plane-parallel ion chamber to
 passively scattered proton beams at fluence-averaged LET. Comparisons to the
 expected values obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations were made on the
 basis of both dose and LET. RESULTS: The maximum difference in the quenching
 factor was 20%, resulting in a 5% change in LET with a response ratio over a
 range of 5 keV/mum. Among all the scintillators investigated, the ratio of
 PMMA to BCF-12 provided the best correlation with LET values and was
 therefore used to construct the LET calibration curve. The expected LET
 values in the validation set were within 2% +/- 6%, which resulted in dose
 accuracy of 1.5% +/- 5.8% for the range of LET values investigated in this
 work. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of using the ratio of the
 light outputs of two organic scintillators to simultaneously measure LET and
 dose in therapeutic proton beams for fluence-averaged LET values from 0.47 to
 1.26 keV/mum. Further studies are needed to verify the response for higher
 LET values and the reproducibility of this method.",
