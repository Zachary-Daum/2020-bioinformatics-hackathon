    abstract "BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhea is cramping abdominal pain
 associated with menses. It is prevalent, affects quality of life, and can
 cause absenteeism. Although evidence-based medical treatment options exist,
 women may not tolerate these or may prefer to use nonmedical treatments.
 Physical activity has been recommended by clinicians for primary dysmenorrhea
 since the 1930s, but there is still no high-quality evidence on which to
 recommend its use. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the effectiveness of
 physical activity for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. STUDY DESIGN:
 Systematic literature searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science,
 CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, Allied and Complimentary Medicine
 Database, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry
 Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and OpenGrey were performed, from database
 inception to May 24, 2017. Google searches and citation searching of previous
 reviews were also conducted. Studies were selected using the following PICOS
 criteria: participants were nonathlete females experiencing primary
 dysmenorrhea; intervention was physical activity delivered for at least 2
 menstrual cycles; comparator was any comparator; outcomes were pain intensity
 or pain duration; and study type was randomized controlled trials. Study
 quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Random effects
 meta-analyses for pain intensity and pain duration were conducted, with
 prespecified subgroup analysis by type of physical activity intervention.
 Strength of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: Searches
 identified 15 eligible randomized controlled trials totaling 1681
 participants. Data from 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Pooled
 results demonstrated effect estimates for physical activity vs comparators
 for pain intensity (-1.89 cm on visual analog scale; 95% CI, -2.96 to -1.09)
 and pain duration (-3.92 hours; 95% CI, -4.86 to -2.97). Heterogeneity for
 both of these results was high and only partly mitigated by subgroup
 analysis. Primary studies were of low or moderate methodological quality but
 results for pain intensity remained stable during sensitivity analysis by
 study quality. GRADE assessment found moderate-quality evidence for pain
 intensity and low-quality evidence for pain duration. CONCLUSION: Clinicians
 can inform women that physical activity may be an effective treatment for
 primary dysmenorrhea but there is a need for high-quality trials before this
 can be confirmed.",
