    abstract "The boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman (Coleoptera:
 Curculionidae), is an important pest of cotton (Gossypium spp. (Malvales:
 Malvaceae)) in South America, Mexico, and southernmost Texas in the United
 States. A key factor in the persistence of the boll weevil is its ability to
 survive the noncotton season. Mechanisms facilitating this survival in
 subtropical and tropical areas are incompletely known, and our understanding
 has been further complicated by recent reports of overwintering on noncotton
 hosts. In addition, the nature and even existence of the adult dormancy, and
 validity of the criteria used to distinguish it, have been questioned. We
 manipulated the boll weevil diet to produce a range of diapause responses and
 observed the corresponding host-free survival patterns. The estimated
 proportion of diapause was associated with subsequent survival. In addition,
 different diets producing similar incidences of diapause resulted in
 substantially different host-free longevity, and the longest survival was
 observed for weevils fed bolls as adults. Survival patterns exhibited a
 negative temperature dependence except for the lowest observed temperature
 (12.8 degrees C), where survival was reduced compared with that at 18.3
 degrees C. This suggests chronic chilling injury in response to extended
 exposure to low, above freezing temperatures. All but the highest temperature
 (29.4 degrees C) facilitated survival >6 mo, and survival of >1 yr was
 observed at 18.3 degrees C. The temperatures permitting the greatest survival
 are typical for many subtropical and tropical regions during the noncotton
 season, indicating that diapausing boll weevils are capable of surviving the
 noncotton season in these regions without the benefit of presumptive
 noncotton hosts.",
