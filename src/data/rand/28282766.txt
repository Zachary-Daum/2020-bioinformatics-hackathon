    abstract "PURPOSE: Investigating risk factors for amniotic fluid embolism
 (AFE)-induced fatality. METHODS: A systematic review of cases of AFE
 available on PubMed, Scielo, Scopus and AJOL databases that occurred from
 1990 to 2015 was carried out. After careful reading of titles, abstracts and
 full texts, case reports of AFE were reviewed. Risk factors for AFE were
 considered as independent variables in logistic regression models. The first
 model was built on the whole data pool. The second model was built on typical
 cases of AFE, according to the classical triad of symptoms (heart, lungs,
 coagulopathy). The dependent variable was fatality in both models. RESULTS:
 177 cases of AFE were assessed in the first model, while 121 typical cases of
 AFE were assessed in the second model. Among typical cases of AFE, only
 oxytocin infusion during labour increases the likelihood of death (odds ratio
 2.890, 95% confidence interval 1.166-7.164, p = 0.022). No risk factors for
 fatality were found in the whole data pool. CONCLUSIONS: Further research on
 national registries should focus on the behaviour of oxytocin infusion during
 labour in AFE cases.",
