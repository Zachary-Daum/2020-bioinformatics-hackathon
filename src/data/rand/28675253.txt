    abstract "The efficacy of sweep nets and a CDC white light-suction trap
 for the sampling of Culicoides species (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) were
 compared on a livestock farm in Northern Spain during the Summer of 2013. A
 total of 6,082 specimens representing 26 species were collected with sweep
 nets in 4 areas at di erent heights (ground level, 1.5 m, and 3 m), and 8,463
 specimens representing 28 species with a single white light trap. Eight
 species - Culicoides brunnicans, Culicoides punctatus, Culicoides
 obsoletus/Culicoides scoticus, Culicoides lupicaris, Culcoides picturatus,
 Culicoides achrayi, and Culicoides simulator - were dominant and accounted
 for 97.4% and 97.2% of the total specimens collected with both methods, sweep
 nets, and light traps, respectively. The sex ratios with sweep netting and
 light trapping were strongly female biased (78.4% and 97.1%, respectively).
 Nulliparous and parous females were predominantly captured with both methods.
 A high percentage (17%) of gravid females was, however, captured on manure at
 ground level while sweeping. Searches for male swarms revealed the presence
 of several C. punctatus swarms consisting of 26 to 196 males and 3 swarms of
 C. obsoletus that ranged from 1 to 12 males in size. This study suggested
 that both methods are suitable and complementary tools for Culicoides
 sampling.",
