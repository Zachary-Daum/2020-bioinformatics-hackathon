    abstract "The dynamics of tumor burden, secreted proteins or other
 biomarkers over time, is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy
 and to predict outcomes for patients. Many methods have been proposed to
 investigate longitudinal trends to better characterize patients and to
 understand disease progression. However, most approaches assume a homogeneous
 patient population and a uniform response trajectory over time and across
 patients. Here, we present a mixture piecewise linear Bayesian hierarchical
 model, which takes into account both population heterogeneity and nonlinear
 relationships between biomarkers and time. Simulation results show that our
 method was able to classify subjects according to their patterns of treatment
 response with greater than 80% accuracy in the three scenarios tested. We
 then applied our model to a large randomized controlled phase III clinical
 trial of multiple myeloma patients. Analysis results suggest that the
 longitudinal tumor burden trajectories in multiple myeloma patients are
 heterogeneous and nonlinear, even among patients assigned to the same
 treatment cohort. In addition, between cohorts, there are distinct
 differences in terms of the regression parameters and the distributions among
 categories in the mixture. Those results imply that longitudinal data from
 clinical trials may harbor unobserved subgroups and nonlinear relationships;
 accounting for both may be important for analyzing longitudinal data.",
