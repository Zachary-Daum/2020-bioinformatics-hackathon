    abstract "The law on medically assisted procreation in Italy, from its
 entering into force, has undergone numerous amendments. This has been due to
 the fact that those citizens, directly affected by its imposed prohibitions,
 have not given in, bringing their requests before the courts, both nationally
 and internationally. Over the years, the courts through numerous rulings have
 significantly changed a law clearly incapable of protecting the rights of
 those involved. Currently Italy has an acceptable law on M.A.P. which is the
 result of the strong willing of citizens affected by problems of sterility or
 infertility. The aim of this paper is to present an historical summary of the
 troubled path which the issue, from every perspective, has faced and is still
 facing today. As well, it will document how, in Italy, the case-law and,
 therefore, the law's interpretation and application by the judges have
 contributed, in the end, to shaping a positive legislation.",
