    abstract "It is unknown whether providing housing to persons experiencing
 homelessness decreases HIV risk. Housing, including access to preventive
 services and counseling, might provide a period of transition for persons
 with HIV risk factors. We assessed whether the new HIV diagnosis rate was
 associated with duration of supportive housing. We linked data from a cohort
 of 21,689 persons without a previous HIV diagnosis who applied to a
 supportive housing program in New York City (NYC) during 2007-2013 to the NYC
 HIV surveillance registry. We used time-dependent Cox modeling to compare new
 HIV diagnoses among recipients of supportive housing (defined a priori, for
 program evaluation purposes, as persons who spent > 7 days in supportive
 housing; n = 6447) and unplaced applicants (remainder of cohort), after
 balancing the groups on baseline characteristics with propensity score
 weights. Compared with unplaced applicants, persons who received >/= 3
 continuous years of supportive housing had decreased risk for new HIV
 diagnosis (HR 0.10; CI 0.01-0.99). Risk of new HIV diagnosis decreased with
 longer duration placement in supportive housing. Supportive housing might aid
 in primary HIV prevention.",
