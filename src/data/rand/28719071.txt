    abstract "Membrane separation technologies are of great interest in
 industrial processes such as water purification, gas separation, and
 materials synthesis. However, commercial filtration membranes have broad pore
 size distributions, leading to poor size cutoff properties. In this work,
 mesoporous silica thin membranes with uniform and large vertical mesochannels
 are synthesized via a simple biphase stratification growth method, which
 possess an intact structure over centimeter size, ultrathin thickness (</=50
 nm), high surface areas (up to 1420 m(2) g(-1) ), and tunable pore sizes from
  approximately 2.8 to 11.8 nm by adjusting the micelle parameters. The
 nanofilter devices based on the free-standing mesoporous silica thin
 membranes show excellent performances in separating differently sized gold
 nanoparticles (>91.8%) and proteins (>93.1%) due to the uniform pore
 channels. This work paves a promising way to develop new membranes with
 well-defined pore diameters for highly efficient nanosize-based separation at
 the macroscale.",
