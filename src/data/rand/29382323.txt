    abstract "BACKGROUND: The new nine-valent vaccine against human
 papillomavirus (HPV) includes the four HPV genotypes (6, 11, 16, and 18) that
 are targeted by the older quadrivalent HPV vaccine, plus five additional
 oncogenic types (31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) remain significantly associated with
 high grade lesions. We aimed to determine the prevalence of high-risk HPV
 genotypes in unvaccinated subjects and the association of these genotypes
 with the incidence of high-grade lesions. We also assessed which, if either,
 of these two HPV vaccines could have prevented these cases. METHODS: This
 cross-sectional study, conducted from 4 January 2010 to 30 December 2011, was
 composed of 595 women attending the Hospital General Universitario de Elche
 (Spain) gynaecology department who were positively screened for opportunistic
 cervical cancer by pap smears and HPV detection during a routine
 gynaecological health check. The pap smear results were classified using the
 Bethesda system. HPV genotyping was performed with the Linear Array HPV
 genotyping test, and viruses were classified by the International Agency for
 Research on Cancer assessment of HPV carcinogenicity. Odds ratios (ORs) with
 their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by logistic
 regression, adjusting for age and immigrant status. The prevented fraction
 among those exposed (PFe-adjusted) was determined as a measure of impact.
 RESULTS: At least one of the additional five high-risk HPV genotypes present
 in the nine-valent HPV vaccine was detected in 20.5% of subjects. After
 excluding women with genotype 16 and/or 18 co-infection, high-risk genotypes
 (31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) were associated with a higher risk of
 intraepithelial lesion or malignancy: adjusted OR = 3.51 (95% CI, 1.29-9.56),
 PFe-adjusted = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.22-0.90). Genotypes that are still
 non-vaccine-targeted were detected in 17.98% of the women, but these were not
 significantly associated with high-grade lesions. CONCLUSION: The greater
 protection of the nine-valent HPV vaccine is likely to have a positive impact
 because, in the absence of genotype 16 or 18 infection, these five genotypes
 on their own remained significantly associated with high-grade lesions.",
