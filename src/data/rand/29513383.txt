    abstract "In this account, we describe our recent progress on
 transition-metal-free-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions using
 tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) as the catalyst and tert-butyl hydroperoxide
 (TBHP) as the oxidant. A rich variety of important organic compounds
 including alpha-acyloxy ethers, tert-butyl peresters, allylic esters, amides,
 alpha-amino nitriles, fully substituted pyrazoles, N-sulfonyl formamidines,
 alpha-amino acid esters, cyanomethyl esters, N-nitrosamines, and
 3-acyloxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofurans have been successfully achieved in high
 chemoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested that TBAI could decompose
 TBHP to (t) BuO(.) and (t) BuOO(.) or be oxdized to (hypo)iodite by TBHP.",
