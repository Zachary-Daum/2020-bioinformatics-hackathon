    abstract "BACKGROUND: In both developed and developing countries,
 cardiovascular disease is on the rise, representing nowadays one of the main
 challenges for the health systems worldwide. This increase generates relevant
 costs. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic and meta-analytical
 review of the prevalence of depression in cardiovascular patients in Iran.
 METHODS: Articles written in English and Persian were searched from January
 2000 to July 2017 in different scholarly databases. RESULTS: 12 studies were
 retained and included in the current meta-analysis. Selected studies were
 published between 2008 and 2016. The number of patients participating in
 these studies was 9292. Based on the random-effects model, the prevalence of
 depression in cardiovascular patients in Iran was 47% [95% confidence
 interval or CI 38-56], I(2)=98.2% with P = 0.000. The relative risk (RR) of
 depression in cardiovascular patients yielded a value of 1.30 [95%CI
 1.05-1.62] with P < 0.001. Women are more at risk for depression than men.
 CONCLUSION: The current meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of depression
 among cardiovascular patients in Iran. The prevalence found computed by the
 present study is higher than the figures found in developed countries.
 Depression with cardiovascular disease causes many problems for these
 patients, and early diagnosis and treatment significantly helps in improving
 quality of life, as well as saving costs and resources.",
