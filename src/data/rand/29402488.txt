    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Relapse of tuberculosis (TB) is known to be as one
 of the major risk factors for resistant TB. The aim of this study is to focus
 on clinical, radiological and bacteriological features of patients with
 pulmonary TB relapse. METHODS: We performed a retrospective survey in the
 respiratory department of the teaching hospital La Rabta in Tunis between
 January 2000 and December 2014. Data of patients with a pulmonary TB relapse
 were analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, among 1250 patients
 hospitalized for pulmonary TB, 44 had a TB relapse. The TB relapse rate was
 estimated to be at 3.5%. The average age was 43.95+/-16.7 years. Sex ratio
 was 5,2. Eighty one percent of patients were current smokers. Alcoholism was
 found in 40.9% of cases. The mean time to relapse was 6.37+/-3.7 years. The
 radiological lesions were moderately extended at least in 54.6% of cases. A
 resistant TB was found in 33% of cases (mono-resistance: 33.3%, multi-drug
 resistance (TB-MR): 11,1%, poly-resistance: 55.5%). The most incriminated
 drugs were isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. One patient received TB-MR
 treatment regimen for 18 months. In the other cases, the duration of
 treatment was prolonged. Recovery was obtained in 72.7% of cases, two
 patients died and 22.7% of patients were lost to follow up. CONCLUSION: In
 Tunisia, TB relapse usually affects young male patients who are often
 alcoholic and smokers. Resistant TB is frequent among these patients. These
 findings lead us to emphasize the need of rapid diagnosis tools and adapted
 treatment regimen in these patients.",
