    abstract "IL15, a member of the common gamma chain receptor (gammac)
 cytokine family, is gaining attention in recent years as one of the most
 promising anti-tumor agents. IL15 regulates T cell activation and
 proliferation, promotes the survival of CD8(+) CD44(hi) memory T cells and is
 also essential for NK cell expansion and development. Despite the attraction
 of developing IL15 as an anti-cancer agent, production of recombinant IL15
 has proven to be difficult due to the stringent control of IL15 expression at
 the transcriptional, translational and the post-translational levels.
 Furthermore, the bioactivity of IL15 fused to an extra functional domain that
 is isolated from mammalian cells is generally inferior to recombinant IL15
 produced by E. coli. In this study, we report that Lysine 86 in IL15 is
 responsible for the instability in mammalian cells when its C-terminus is
 fused to the albumin binding scFv (IL15-A10m3). We demonstrate that K86A or
 K86R mutants increased the expression of the fusion protein from HEK293cells.
 When the wild type IL15 is used for the fusion, no recombinant IL15 fusion
 was detected in the culture media. Additionally, we determined that the
 residue 112 in IL15 is critical for the bioactivity of IL15-A10m3.
 Examination of single and double mutants provides a better understanding of
 how IL15 engages with its receptor complex to achieve full signaling
 capacity. The results of our experiments were successfully applied to scale
 up production to levels up to 50mg/L and >10mg/L of >95% pure monomeric
 recombinant fusion proteins after a 2-step purification from culture media.
 More importantly, the recombinant fusion protein produced is fully active in
 stimulating T cell proliferation, when compared to the recombinant wild type
 IL15.",
