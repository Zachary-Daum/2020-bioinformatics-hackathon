    abstract "This paper presents an approximate optimal distributed control
 scheme for a known interconnected system composed of input affine nonlinear
 subsystems using event-triggered state and output feedback via a novel hybrid
 learning scheme. First, the cost function for the overall system is redefined
 as the sum of cost functions of individual subsystems. A distributed optimal
 control policy for the interconnected system is developed using the optimal
 value function of each subsystem. To generate the optimal control policy,
 forward-in-time, neural networks are employed to reconstruct the unknown
 optimal value function at each subsystem online. In order to retain the
 advantages of event-triggered feedback for an adaptive optimal controller, a
 novel hybrid learning scheme is proposed to reduce the convergence time for
 the learning algorithm. The development is based on the observation that, in
 the event-triggered feedback, the sampling instants are dynamic and results
 in variable interevent time. To relax the requirement of entire state
 measurements, an extended nonlinear observer is designed at each subsystem to
 recover the system internal states from the measurable feedback. Using a
 Lyapunov-based analysis, it is demonstrated that the system states and the
 observer errors remain locally uniformly ultimately bounded and the control
 policy converges to a neighborhood of the optimal policy. Simulation results
 are presented to demonstrate the performance of the developed controller.",
