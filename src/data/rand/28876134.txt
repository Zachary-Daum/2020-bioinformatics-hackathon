    abstract "As interprofessional education (IPE) continues to be instituted,
 much attention has been paid to training-intervention effectiveness. Less
 attention has been paid to the selection side of the IPE model; however,
 efficient delivery is necessary to sustain the development of IPE. This short
 report investigates the ""two big social cognitions"" (agency and communion)
 as individual-difference predictors of attitude change and knowledge
 acquisition. A 3-week before-after observational design with survey
 methodology was conducted in a pre-licensure IPE setting (n = 82). Results
 indicated significant interactions of agency and communion in predicting
 learner outcomes. Our findings should stimulate future IPE researchers to
 identify additional, selection-relevant design factors (e.g., individual
 differences) that may enhance comparative-effectiveness of IPE.",
