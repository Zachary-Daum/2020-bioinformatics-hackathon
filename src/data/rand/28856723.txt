    abstract "BACKGROUND: Understanding influences on women's preferred
 delivery mode is vital for planning interventions to reduce cesarean rates
 and for ensuring that women receive correct information. Our objectives were
 to: determine if sources of information influencing a pregnant woman's
 preferred delivery mode and knowledge of cesarean indications differ by
 sociodemographic characteristics; to conduct a factor analysis of items
 related to information sources influencing this preference; and to determine
 if knowledge differs by information sources influencing this preference or
 their underlying latent constructs. METHODS: Data from a prospective cohort
 study conducted in Buenos Aires was analyzed. Healthy nulliparous women aged
 18-35, at >32 weeks of gestation and with live, singleton pregnancies
 participated. The primary research questions were evaluated using Chi-square
 tests, factor analysis, logistic regression, and generalized estimating
 equations. RESULTS: A total of 382 women participated in the study. Women of
 lower socioeconomic status were more influenced by people, magazines and
 TV/movies in their mode of delivery preferences, and had poorer knowledge of
 cesarean indications. Sources of influence for preferred delivery mode and
 factors derived in factor analysis were not associated with knowledge level
 when considered individually or together, or when adjusted for
 sociodemographic characteristics, or when accounting for clustering by the
 hospital sector (public or private). CONCLUSIONS: Higher socioeconomic status
 is associated with being less influenced by people and with better knowledge
 of indications for cesarean delivery. Knowledge of cesarean indications was
 not associated with the source of information about mode of delivery
 preferences.",
