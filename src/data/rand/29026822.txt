    abstract "BACKGROUND: Intraoperative nerve stimulation is done routinely
 in brachial plexus and peripheral nerve surgery as well as in selective
 neurectomy in spastic patients. OBJECTIVE: The current study compares the use
 of 2 different devices for nerve stimulation: a totally disposable nerve
 stimulator and a nerve stimulator used for nerve blocks by anesthetists.
 METHODS: A retrospective study of 60 patients who underwent brachial plexus
 surgery: In 30 patients, we used the totally disposable nerve stimulator
 (group 1) and in another 30 patients, we used the anesthesia device (group
 2). The cost of disposable materials used for nerve stimulation was
 calculated in each group. The same surgeon performed all operations, and he
 was asked to give his subjective opinion regarding the convenience and ease
 of use of the device in each group. RESULTS: The main advantages of the
 totally disposable device are its placement totally within the sterile field,
 and it is operated by the surgeon without the need to communicate with the
 anesthetist. However, the totally disposable device had several major
 disadvantages when compared to the anesthesia device. Firstly, the disposable
 stimulator can only deliver 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mA stimuli, while the
 anesthesia device can deliver stimuli of 0.1 to 5 mA (in 0.1 mA increments).
 Secondly, the disposable stimulator frequently fails to operate during
 surgery, and this is not experienced with the anesthesia device. Finally, the
 cost of disposables is less using the anesthesia device. CONCLUSION: Our
 center has stopped using the disposable nerve stimulator in favour for the
 anesthesia device.",
