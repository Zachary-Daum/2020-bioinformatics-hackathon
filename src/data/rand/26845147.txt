    abstract "The first gas electron diffraction (GED) experiment for
 histamine was carried out. The equilibrium structure of histamine in the gas
 phase was determined on the basis of the data obtained. The refinement was
 also supported by the rotational constants obtained in previous studies [B.
 Vogelsanger, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1991, 113, 7864-7869; P. Godfrey, et
 al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1998, 120, 10724-10732] and quantum chemical
 calculations. The proposed mechanism of tautomerization by simultaneous
 intermolecular transfer of hydrogens in a histamine dimer helps to explain
 the distribution of tautomers in different experiments. The estimations of
 the conformational interconversion times provided the explanation for the
 absence of some conformers in the rotational spectroscopy experiments. ",
