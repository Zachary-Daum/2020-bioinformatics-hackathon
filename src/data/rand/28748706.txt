    abstract "BACKGROUND: Quantifying hypoglycemia has traditionally been
 limited to using the frequency of hypoglycemic events during a given time
 interval using data from blood glucose (BG) testing. However, continuous
 glucose monitoring (CGM) captures three parameters-a Hypo-Triad-unavailable
 with BG monitoring that can be used to better characterize hypoglycemia: area
 under the curve (AUC), time (duration of hypoglycemia), and frequency of
 daily episodes below a specified threshold. METHODS: We developed two new
 analytic metrics to enhance the traditional Hypo-Triad of CGM-derived data to
 more effectively capture the intensity of hypoglycemia (IntHypo) and overall
 hypoglycemic environment called the ""hypoglycemia risk volume"" (HypoRV). We
 reanalyzed the CGM data from the ASPIRE In-Home study, a randomized,
 controlled trial of a sensor-integrated pump system with a low glucose
 threshold suspend feature (SIP+TS), using these new metrics and compared them
 to standard metrics of hypoglycemia. RESULTS: IntHypo and HypoRV provide
 additional insights into the benefit of a SIP+TS system on glycemic exposure
 when compared to the standard reporting methods. In addition, the visual
 display of these parameters provides a unique and intuitive way to understand
 the impact of a diabetes intervention on a cohort of subjects as well as on
 individual patients. CONCLUSION: The IntHypo and HypoRV are new and enhanced
 ways of analyzing CGM-derived data in diabetes intervention studies which
 could lead to new insights in diabetes management. They require validation
 using existing, ongoing, or planned studies to determine whether they are
 superior to existing metrics.",
