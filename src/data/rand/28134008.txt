    abstract "BACKGROUND: There is little research comparing clinicians' and
 managers' views on priority settings in the healthcare services. During
 research on two different qualitative research projects on healthcare
 prioritisations, we found a striking difference on how hospital executive
 managers and clinical healthcare professionals talked about and understood
 prioritisations. AIM: The purpose of this study is to explore how healthcare
 professionals in mental healthcare and somatic medicine prioritise their
 care, to compare different ways of setting priorities among managers and
 clinicians and to explore how moral dilemmas are balanced and reconciled.
 Research design and participants: We conducted qualitative observations,
 interviews and focus groups with medical doctors, nurses and other clinical
 members of the interdisciplinary team in both somatic medical and mental
 health wards in hospitals in Norway. The interviews were recorded and
 transcribed verbatim. Ethical considerations: Basic ethical principles for
 research ethics were followed. The respondents signed an informed consent for
 participation. They were assured anonymity and confidentiality. The studies
 were approved by relevant ethics committees in line with the Helsinki
 Convention. FINDINGS: Our findings showed a widening gap between the views of
 clinicians on one hand and managers on the other. Clinicians experienced a
 threat to their autonomy, to their professional ideals and to their desire to
 perform their job in a professional way. Prioritisations were a cause of
 constant concern and problematic decisions. Even though several managers
 understood and empathised with the clinicians, the ideals of patient flow and
 keeping budgets balanced were perceived as more important. DISCUSSION: We
 discuss our findings in light of the moral challenges of patient-centred
 individual healthcare versus demands of distributive justice from healthcare
 management. CONCLUSION: The clinicians' ideals of autonomy and good medical
 and nursing care for the individual patients were perceived as endangered.",
