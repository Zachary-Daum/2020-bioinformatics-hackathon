    abstract "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although patients suffering
 community-acquired perforated peptic ulcer (PPU)-associated peritonitis with
 Candida species isolated from their peritoneal fluid have higher chances of
 mortality and experiencing a complicated postoperative clinical course,
 universal antifungal therapy for these patients remains controversial.
 METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of the impacts of antifungal
 therapy on outcomes of patients suffering community-acquired PPU-associated
 peritonitis with Candida species isolated from their ascites at a medical
 center in Taiwan. All included patients received source control and
 antibiotic treatment, with or without additional postoperative antifungal
 therapy with fluconazole or an echinocandin for at least 3 days. RESULTS:
 Among the 133 included patients, 76 did not receive (Group 1) and 57 did
 receive (Group 2) antifungal therapy. Sixteen (12%) of the overall included
 patients died within 30 days. Shock [odds ratio (OR), 5.6; 95% confidence
 interval (CI), 1.9-16.5; p = 0.002] and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic
 Health Evaluation II score (>20; OR, 9.5; 95% CI, 1.1-80.7; p = 0.04) were
 independently associated with 30-day mortality. Among the 80 matched patients
 from Groups 1 and 2 (1:1 matched) with the closest propensity score, no
 significant difference was found in 30-day all-cause mortality, time to
 mortality, the need for reoperation/abscess formation/anastomotic leakage,
 prolonged intensive care unit stay, and prolonged mechanical ventilator
 dependence between patients with and without antifungal therapy. CONCLUSION:
 Our study provides solid evidence supporting the notions that antifungal
 therapies do not benefit patients suffering PPU peritonitis with Candida
 species isolated from their ascites in general, and antifungal therapy could
 be reserved for patients who are critically ill and/or severely
 immunocompromised.",
