    abstract "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of
 morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. The
 accumulation of uremic solutes in this patient population is associated with
 endothelial dysfunction and accelerated cardiovascular disease. In this
 study, we examined the impact of the uremic milieu on the endothelial
 transcription factor, Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a key regulator of
 endothelial function and activation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using serum from
 uremic pigs with chronic renal insufficiency, our results show that KLF2
 expression is suppressed by the uremic milieu and individual uremic solutes
 in vitro. Specifically, KLF2 expression is significantly decreased in human
 umbilical vein endothelial cells after treatment with uremic porcine serum or
 carboxymethyllysine-modified albumin, an advanced glycation end product (AGE)
 known to induce endothelial dysfunction. AGE-mediated suppression of KLF2 is
 dependent on activation of the receptor for AGE, as measured by small
 interfering RNA knockdown of the receptor for AGE. Furthermore, KLF2
 suppression promotes endothelial dysfunction, because adenoviral
 overexpression of KLF2 inhibits reactive oxygen species production and
 leukocyte adhesion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In addition,
 the application of hemodynamic shear stress, prolonged serum dialysis, or
 treatment with the receptor for AGE antagonist azeliragon (TTP488) is
 sufficient to prevent KLF2 suppression in vitro. To decipher the mechanism by
 which uremic AGEs suppress KLF2 expression, we assessed the role of the
 receptor for AGE in activation of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling, a hallmark
 of endothelial cell activation. Using a constitutively active form of
 IkappaBalpha, we show that translocation of p65 to the nucleus is necessary
 for KLF2 suppression after treatment with uremic AGEs. CONCLUSIONS: These
 data identify KLF2 suppression as a consequence of the uremic milieu, which
 may exacerbate endothelial dysfunction and resultant cardiovascular disease.",
