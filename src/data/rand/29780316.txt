    abstract "Evidence suggests that layer 5 pyramidal neurons can be divided
 into functional zones with unique afferent connectivity and membrane
 characteristics that allow for post-synaptic integration of feedforward and
 feedback inputs. To assess the existence of these zones and their
 interaction, we characterized the resonance properties of a
 biophysically-realistic compartmental model of a neocortical layer 5
 pyramidal neuron. Consistent with recently published theoretical and
 empirical findings, our model was configured to have a ""hot zone"" in distal
 apical dendrite and apical tuft where both high- and low-threshold Ca(2+)
 ionic conductances had densities 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than anywhere
 else in the apical dendrite. We simulated injection of broad spectrum
 sinusoidal currents with linearly increasing frequency to calculate the input
 impedance of individual compartments, the transfer impedance between the soma
 and key compartments within the dendritic tree, and a dimensionless term we
 introduce called resonance quality. We show that input resonance analysis
 distinguished at least four distinct zones within the model based on
 properties of their frequency preferences: basal dendrite which displayed
 little resonance; soma/proximal apical dendrite which displayed resonance at
 5-23 Hz, strongest at 5-10 Hz and hyperpolarized/resting membrane potentials;
 distal apical dendrite which displayed resonance at 8-19 Hz, strongest at 10
 Hz and depolarized membrane potentials; and apical tuft which displayed a
 weak resonance largely between 8 and 10 Hz across a wide range of membrane
 potentials. Transfer resonance analysis revealed that changes in subthreshold
 electrical coupling were found to modulate the transfer resonant frequency of
 signals transmitted from distal apical dendrite and apical tuft to the soma,
 which would impact the frequencies that individual neurons are expected to
 respond to and reinforce. Furthermore, eliminating the hot zone was found to
 reduce amplification of resonance within the model, which contributes to
 reduced excitability when perisomatic and distal apical regions receive
 coincident stimulating current injections. These results indicate that the
 interactions between different functional zones should be considered in a
 more complete understanding of neuronal integration. Resonance analysis may
 therefore be a useful tool for assessing the integration of inputs across the
 entire neuronal membrane.",
