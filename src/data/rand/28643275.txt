    abstract "BACKGROUND: Although nitisinone is successfully used to treat
 hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) with the recommended twice-daily dosing,
 data describing a long half-life motivate less frequent dosing. Therefore, in
 agreement with the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee at the
 European Medicines Agency, this study was performed to investigate the switch
 to once-daily dosing. METHODS: This open-label, non-randomized,
 single-sequence crossover study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and
 safety of once-daily compared to twice-daily dosing of nitisinone in patients
 with HT-1 (NCT02323529). Well-controlled patients of <2, 2 to <12, 12 to <18,
 and >/=18 years of age who were on twice-daily dosing were eligible for
 participation. Nitisinone and succinylacetone levels were determined from dry
 blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry. The primary endpoint was Cmin of
 nitisinone after >/=4 weeks of treatment on each dosing regimen. Secondary
 objectives were evaluation of efficacy and safety during each dosing regimen.
 RESULTS: In total, 19 patients were enrolled and 17 included in the
 per-protocol analysis set. The mean (SD) nitisinone Cmin decreased by 23%,
 from 26.4 (10.2) to 21.2 (9.9) mumol/L in dry blood spot samples (not
 equivalent to plasma concentrations), when patients switched from twice- to
 once-daily dosing. There was no apparent age- or bodyweight-related trend in
 the degree of Cmin decrease. No patient had quantifiable succinylacetone
 levels during the once-daily treatment period, indicating efficacious
 treatment. All adverse events were mild or moderate and judged unrelated to
 nitisinone. CONCLUSION: The switch to once-daily treatment with nitisinone
 appeared efficacious and safe in the treatment of patients with HT-1.",
