    abstract "We investigated if the duration and/or frequency of the light
 period affect 24-h rhythm of circadian clock genes in central and peripheral
 tissues of a non-photoperiodic songbird, the spotted munia (Lonchura
 punctulata), in which a circannual rhythm regulates the reproductive cycle.
 We monitored activity-rest pattern and measured 24-h mRNA oscillation of core
 clock (Bmal1, Clock, Per2, Cry1 and Cry2) and clock-controlled (E4bp4,
 Roralpha and Rev-erbalpha) genes in the hypothalamus, retina, liver and gut
 of spotted munia subjected to an aberrant light-dark (LD) cycle (3.5L:3.5D;
 T7, T = period length of LD cycle) and continuous light (LL, 24L:0D), with
 controls on 24-h LD cycle (T24, 12L:12D). Munia exhibited rhythmic
 activity-rest pattern with period matched to T7 or T24 under an LD cycle and
 were arrhythmic with a scattered activity pattern and higher activity
 duration under LL. At the transcriptional level, both clock and
 clock-controlled genes showed a significant 24-h rhythm in all four tissues
 (except Clock in the liver) under 12L:12D, suggesting a conserved
 tissue-level circadian time generation in spotted munia. An exposure to
 3.5L:3.5D or LL induced arrhythmicity in transcriptional oscillation of all
 eight genes in the hypothalamus (except Rev-erbalpha) and liver (except Bmal1
 and Rev-erbalpha under T7 and Cry1 under LL). In the retina, however, all
 genes showed arrhythmic 24-h mRNA expression under LL, but not under T7
 (except in E4bp4 and Roralpha). Interestingly, unlike in the liver, Bmal1,
 Per2, Cry1, Roralpha and Rev-erbalpha mRNA expressions were rhythmic in the
 gut under both T7 (except Roralpha) and LL conditions. These results showed
 variable relationship of internal circadian clocks with the external light
 environment and suggested a weak coupling of circadian clocks between the
 central (hypothalamus and retina) and peripheral (liver and gut) tissues. We
 suggest tissue-level circadian clock regulation of daily physiology and
 behavior in the spotted munia.",
