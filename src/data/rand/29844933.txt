    abstract "Pathogenic bacteria cause various infections worldwide,
 especially in immunocompromised and other susceptible individuals, and are
 also associated with high infant mortality rates in developing countries.
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs with evolutionarily conserved
 sequences, are expressed in various tissues and cells that play key part in
 various physiological and pathologic processes. Increasing evidence implies
 roles for miRNAs in bacterial infectious diseases by modulating inflammatory
 responses, cell penetration, tissue remodeling, and innate and adaptive
 immunity. This review highlights some recent intriguing findings, ranging
 from the correlation between aberrant expression of miRNAs with bacterial
 infection progression to their profound impact on host immune responses.
 Harnessing of dysregulated miRNAs in bacterial infection may be an approach
 to improving the diagnosis, prevention and therapy of infectious diseases.",
