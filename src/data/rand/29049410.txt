    abstract "This prospective study aimed to investigate metamorphopsia in
 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and included 28 eyes (28
 patients) with unilateral CRVO that had macular edema (ME) in the acute
 phase. The ME was treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
 agents. At baseline and at 1 and 6 months after initiation of treatment,
 quantitative measurements of metamorphopsia were performed using M-CHARTS and
 the retinal morphologic changes were examined by optical coherence
 tomography. At baseline, metamorphopsia was detected on M-CHARTS in 14
 (50.0%) eyes. The mean M-CHARTS score was 0.37 +/- 0.53. At 1 month and 6
 months after initiation of treatment, there was substantial resolution of ME
 and significant recovery of visual acuity. In contrast, metamorphopsia was
 still detected in 16 eyes at 6 months; the mean M-CHARTS scores were 0.29 +/-
 0.37 at 1 month and 0.32 +/- 0.38 at 6 months, and had not significantly
 improved from baseline (p = 0.580, and p = 0.604, respectively). Although the
 M-CHARTS score at 6 months was associated with the baseline M-CHARTS score (p
 = 0.004), it did not have any associations with morphologic parameters at
 baseline. However, the M-CHARTS score at 6 months was significantly
 associated with foveal photoreceptor status, height of serous detachment, and
 parafoveal thickening at 1 month. Metamorphopsia associated with CRVO could
 be quantified using M-CHARTS, and often persisted in contrast with the
 recovery of visual acuity and resolution of ME after treatment with
 anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents.",
