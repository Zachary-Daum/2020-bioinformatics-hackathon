    abstract "Heart bypass surgery is the most common treatment for myocardial
 ischemia. Clinical investigations have revealed that isoflurane anesthesia is
 efficient to alleviate pain during cardiac surgery, including heart bypass
 surgery. Previous studies have revealed the protective effects of isoflurane
 on myocardial cells of patients with myocardial ischemia during the
 perioperative period. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism
 underlying the protective effects of isoflurane on myocardial cells in mice
 with myocardial ischemia. ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and
 western blotting were used to analyze the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on
 myocardial cells. Briefly, myocardial cell apoptosis and viability, pain,
 phosphoinositide 3kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway
 expression and the pharmacodynamics of isoflurane were studied in mice
 treated with isoflurane for heart bypass surgery. The results demonstrated
 that isoflurane anesthesia efficiently attenuated pain in mice during
 surgery. Viability and apoptosis of myocardial cells was also improved by
 isoflurane in vitro and in vivo. The PI3K/AKT pathway was upregulated in
 myocardial cells on day 3 postoperation. Mechanistically, isoflurane promoted
 PI3K/AKT activation, upregulated Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)associated X protein
 and Bcl2 expression levels, and reduced the expression levels of caspase3 and
 caspase8 in myocardial cells. In conclusion, the findings indicated that
 isoflurane is beneficial for pain attenuation and inhibits apoptosis of
 myocardial cells via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in mice during cardiac
 surgery.",
