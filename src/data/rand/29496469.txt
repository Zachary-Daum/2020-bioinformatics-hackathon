    abstract "With ubiquitous applications of nanotechnology, there are
 increasing probabilities of exposure to manufactured nanoparticles (NPs),
 which might be posing emerging health concerns on the next generation. Recent
 data suggest that generation of reactive oxygen species may play an integral
 role in the carbon black nanoparticles (CBNPs)-induced oxidative injury;
 however, the exact molecular mechanism has not been clarified. Hence, the
 role of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis pathways in the
 CBNPs-induced neuronal toxicity following in-ovo exposure of chicken embryo
 was elucidated. Specific pathogen-free fertilized Sasso eggs were inoculated
 with 4.8, 9.5 and 14mug CBNPs/egg at the 3rd day of incubation alongside
 vehicle controls. In a concentration-dependent manner, CBNPs inoculation
 induced oxidative stress, which was ascertained by enhancement of lipid
 peroxides and diminishing total antioxidant capacity and glutathione levels,
 and catalase activity in brain tissues. mRNA transcript levels of antioxidant
 genes showed up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 and superoxide dismutase-1,
 with marked down-regulation of glutathione S-transferase-alpha. Additionally,
 the pro-inflammatory genes; nuclear factor-kappaB1 was up-regulated, while
 interferon-gamma was down-regulated. There is also a clear down-regulation in
 apoptotic markers caspase-8, caspase-3, cytochrome c and B-cell CLL/lymphoma
 2at the different concentrations, while caspase-2 is up-regulated only at
 higher concentration. Collectively, these results show that CBNPs
 exposure-mediated overproduction of the free radicals, particularly at higher
 concentration contributes to inflammation and subsequent cellular apoptosis
 at the gene expression level, thus unveiling possible molecular relationship
 between CBNPs and genes linked to the oxidant, inflammatory and apoptotic
 responses.",
