    abstract "The aim of this study is to provide a discussion on the
 definitions and conceptual dimensions of Responsible Research and Innovation
 based on findings from the literature. In the study, the outcomes of a
 literature review of 235 RRI-related articles were presented. The articles
 were selected from the EBSCO and Google Scholar databases regarding the
 definitions and dimensions of RRI. The results of the study indicated that
 while administrative definitions were widely quoted in the reviewed
 literature, they were not substantially further elaborated. Academic
 definitions were mostly derived from the institutional definitions; however,
 more empirical studies should be conducted in order to give a broader
 empirical basis to the development of the concept. In the current study, four
 distinct conceptual dimensions of RRI that appeared in the reviewed
 literature were brought out: inclusion, anticipation, responsiveness and
 reflexivity. Two emerging conceptual dimensions were also added:
 sustainability and care.",
