    abstract "This study examines the extent to which knowledge of
 recreational marijuana laws, health effects, and perceptions of risk for
 marijuana use differ between Spanish- and English-speaking Latino survey
 respondents from a registry of Colorado adults. Spanish-speaking Latino
 respondents (n = 47) had less accurate knowledge of laws permitting use of
 marijuana than English-speaking Latino respondents (n = 154), while reporting
 greater agreement with negative health effects and higher perception of risk
 associated with marijuana use. The results suggest that efforts to
 communicate health and informational messaging to the public about legalized
 marijuana should consider linguistic variations when tailoring campaigns for
 Latino audiences.",
