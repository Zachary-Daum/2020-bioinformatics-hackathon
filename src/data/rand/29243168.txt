    abstract "PURPOSE: Patients with metastatic cancer can experience
 debilitating symptoms, which may influence attitudes towards and engagement
 in physical activity. This study aimed to examine the attitudes of patients
 living with metastatic prostate cancer towards physical activity. MATERIALS
 AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were completed with male patients
 living with metastatic prostate cancer. Interviews included eight questions
 related to patients' attitudes towards physical activity. Content analysis
 was conducted on the transcribed interview data. Twenty men with metastatic
 prostate cancer (mean age 71 +/- 8.5 years; body mass index 30.19 +/- 5.37
 kg/cm(2)) and associated bone metastases (55% with > 2 regions affected)
 participated in the study. RESULTS: Men's views towards physical activity
 were coded into the following major themes: (1) barriers to physical
 activity, (2) benefits of physical activity, (3) a reduction in physical
 activity levels post diagnosis and (4) social support for physical activity.
 Symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer and treatment side effects including
 pain and fatigue negatively influenced activity participation. In addition,
 many generic barriers to physical activity were described such as bad weather
 and a lack of suitable facilities for exercising in rural areas. CONCLUSION:
 Men living with metastatic prostate cancer have unique needs regarding
 physical activity related to symptoms of both their cancer and cancer
 treatment. There is a need to increase prompts that encourage those with
 metastatic prostate cancer to maintain/increase physical activity levels post
 diagnosis. Given the individualised needs of this patient group, referral to
 a cancer exercise specialist should be considered for prescription of
 tailored physical activity programmes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov
