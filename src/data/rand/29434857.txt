    abstract "The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical
 significance of abnormal sugar-chain glycoprotein tumor abnormal protein
 (TAP) in the screening of common digestive tract pre-cancer colon
 adenocarcinoma lesions. A total of 50 colitis patients, 50 colon polyp
 patients and 50 colon adenocarcinoma patients admitted to our hospital from
 March, 2012 to May, 2014 were included. Fresh blood from patient's fingertips
 was collected and condensation staining was used to detect TAP expression.
 Positive expressions of TAP in patients in the colitis, colon polyp and colon
 adenocarcinoma groups prior to treatment were 6,76 and 92%, respectively. The
 TAP-positive expression rate comparisons between the three groups were
 statistically significant (P<0.05), and TAP-positive expression showed an
 increasing trend. TAP-positive expression was not significantly correlated
 with sex, age or ethnic group (P>0.05). Patient follow-up revealed that the
 tumor incidence rate in TAP-positive patients was significantly higher than
 that in TAP-negative in the colitis and colon polyp groups (P<0.05), and the
 postoperative tumor recurrence rate in TAP-positive patients was
 significantly higher than that in TAP-negative in the colon adenocarcinoma
 group (P<0.05). TAP had a higher expression in colon pre-adenocarcinoma
 lesions. Additionally, TAP participated in the processes from intestinal
 mucosal inflammation to colon polyp formation to tissue canceration, and was
 correlated with these. Thus, TAP can be used for the screening of digestive
 tract precancerous lesions.",
