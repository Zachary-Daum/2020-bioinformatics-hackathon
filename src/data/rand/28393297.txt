    abstract "In response to a dearth of research on injuries among children
 of immigrants, this study examined child injury rates by immigrant
 generation. We used generalized estimating equations and nationally
 representative data to estimate injury risk for school-aged children of
 immigrants of different generations compared to children of native, US-born
 parents. After controlling for multiple other factors including socioeconomic
 status, citizenship, and children's general health, both 1st and 2nd
 generation school-aged children had significantly lower odds of having
 injuries compared to children of natives. Additional analyses also found
 lower odds of injuries among 1st and 2nd generation children relative to
 children of natives that persisted in both lower- and higher-income families.
 The findings suggest that 1st and 2nd generation immigrant families possess
 factors that protect children from injury independent of socioeconomic
 status. Policy and program development would benefit from a clearer
 understanding of these protective factors.",
