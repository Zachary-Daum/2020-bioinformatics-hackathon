    abstract "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Impaired mobility is one of the primary
 causes of declined functional capacity in old age. The timed up-and-go test
 (TUG), a common mobility test, has been studied extensively in Western
 countries. The purposes of this study were to compare and identify factors
 associated with TUG performance in older adults with impaired mobility and
 living in different cities in Taiwan. METHODS: Older adults living in Taipei,
 Tainan, and Niaosong cities were screened for mobility impairments and then
 recruited. A series of questionnaires and physical and functional tests were
 used to obtain information and measurements for potential contributing
 factors and TUG. Regression analysis was conducted to determine factors
 contributing to TUG. RESULTS: A total of 413 older adults participated in the
 study. The mean TUG was 14.3 seconds for participants across the three
 cities, and was significantly shorter in Tainan. Age, number of medications,
 fear of falling, depression, high intensity activity time, reaction time,
 single leg stance time, and functional reach distance were found to have
 significant contribution. These factors accounted for approximately half of
 the variance in TUG. The regression equations were not equal for the
 different cities, with depression being the only common determinant.
 CONCLUSION: Taiwanese older adults with mobility problems living in different
 cities performed differently in TUG and the contributing factors were also
 different. These findings indicate a need of further studies examining older
 adults in different environments.",
