    abstract "BACKGROUND: More than 80% of patients with advanced cancer
 develop weight loss. Because preclinical data suggest poly (ADP-ribose)
 polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can treat this weight loss, this study was
 undertaken to explore the PARP inhibitor veliparib for this indication.
 OBJECTIVE: The current study was undertaken to analyze prospectively gathered
 data on weight in cancer patients on PARP inhibitors. DESIGN/SETTING: The
 current study relied on a previously published, prospectively conducted phase
 1 single institution trial that combined veliparib and topotecan
 (NCT01012817) as antineoplastic therapy for advanced cancer patients. Serial
 weight data and, when available and clinically relevant, computerized
 tomography scans were also examined. MEASUREMENTS: The primary endpoint was
 10% or greater weight gain from trial enrollment. RESULTS: Nearly all 60
 patients lost weight over time. Only one patient manifested a 10% or greater
 gain in weight. However, review of computerized tomography L3 images showed
 this weight gain was a manifestation of ascites. Four other patients gained
 5% of their baseline weight. However, findings in two patients with available
 radiographs showed no evidence of muscle augmentation. CONCLUSIONS: The
 addition of the PARP inhibitor veliparib to chemotherapy does not appear to
 result in notable weight gain or in weight maintenance in patients with
 advanced cancer. Interventions other than PARP inhibitors should be
 considered for the palliation/treatment of cancer-associated weight loss.",
