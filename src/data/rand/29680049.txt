    abstract "Several Penjar accessions of tomato grown in the Mediterranean
 exhibit prolonged shelf life and harbor alcobaca mutation. To uncover the
 metabolic basis underlying shelf life, we compared four Penjar accessions to
 Ailsa Craig. Three accessions bore alcobaca mutation, whereas the fourth was
 a novel NAC-NOR allele. Cuticle composition of Penjars varied widely during
 fruit ripening. All Penjars exhibited delayed ripening, prolonged on-vine and
 off-vine shelf life, low ethylene emission, and carotenoid levels. Metabolic
 profiling revealed shifts in Krebs cycle intermediates, amino acids, and
 gamma-aminobutyric acid levels indicating the attenuation of respiration in
 Penjars during post-harvest storage. Penjar fruits also showed concerted
 downregulation of several cell-wall modifying genes and related metabolites.
 The high ABA and sucrose levels at the onset of senescence in Penjar fruits
 likely contribute to reduced water loss. Our analyses reveal that the
 attenuation of various metabolic processes by NAC-NOR mutation likely
 prolongs the shelf life of Penjar fruits.",
