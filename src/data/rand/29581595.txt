    abstract "BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications have been recognized as an
 important mechanism underlying carcinoma progression. DNA methylation plays
 an important role in cancer biology and represents potentially heritable
 changes in gene expression that do not involve DNA sequence. The aim of this
 study was to investigate promoter methylation of selected genes in sinonasal
 carcinoma by comparison with noncancerous sinonasal tissue. METHODS: To
 search for epigenetic events (methylation in 25 tumor suppressor genes) we
 used MS-MLPA (Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe
 amplification) to compare methylation status of 59 formalin fixed, paraffin
 embedded tissue samples of sinonasal carcinomas with 18 control samples. The
 most important changes in methylation were confirmed using MSP (Methylation
 specific PCR). Detected alterations in methylation were compared with
 clinicopathological characteristics. RESULTS: Using a 20% cut-off for
 methylation (MS-MLPA), we found significantly higher methylation in GATA5
 (P=0.0005), THSB1 (P=0.0002) and PAX5 (P=0.03) genes in the sinonasal cancer
 group compared to the control group. Methylation in five or more genes was
 associated with impaired overall survival (P=0.017). CONCLUSION: These
 findings provide evidence that alterations in methylation profile may be one
 of the major mechanisms in sinonasal carcinogenesis. In addition, changes in
 methylation could potentially be used as prognostic factors of sinonasal
 carcinoma and may have implications for future individualized therapy based
 on epigenetic changes.",
