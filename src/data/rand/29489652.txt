    abstract "Population aging is associated with increasing numbers of
 geriatric trauma patients, and various studies have evaluated their
 short-term outcomes, assessment, and treatment. However, there is
 insufficient information regarding their long-term outcomes. This study
 evaluated the physical and nutritional statuses of geriatric patients after
 trauma-related hospitalization.Data regarding physical and nutritional status
 were obtained from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination
 Survey VI (2013-2015).A total of 21,069 individuals participated in the
 survey, including 5650 geriatric individuals. After excluding individuals
 with missing data, 3731 cases were included in the analyses. The average age
 was 68 years, and most individuals were women (n = 2055, 55.08%). There were
 94 patients had been hospitalized because of trauma. Trauma-related
 hospitalization among geriatric patients was significantly associated with
 reduced strength exercise (23.56% vs 12.99%, P = .043), activity limitations
 caused by joint pain (0.65% vs 3.31%, P = .028), self-care problems (8.00% vs
 16.77%, P = .008), pain or discomfort (29.48% vs 40.51%, P = .024),
 hypercholesterolemia (27.37% vs 39.36%, P = .037), and mastication discomfort
 (39.98% vs 57.85% P = .005). The adjusted analyses revealed that
 trauma-related hospitalization was independently associated with activity
 limitations caused by joint pain (odds ratio [OR]: 5.04, 95% confidence
 interval [CI]: 1.29-19.67, P = .020), self-care problems (OR: 2.24, 95% CI:
 1.11-4.53, P = .025), pain or discomfort (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.08-2.89, P =
 .023), and mastication discomfort (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.22-3.46, P =
 .007).Medical staff should be aware that geriatric patients have relatively
 poor physical and nutritional statuses after trauma-related hospitalization,
 and manage these patients accordingly.",
