    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of circulating long
 non-coding RNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (lncRNA NEAT1)
 expression with disease risk, severity, prognosis and inflammatory cytokine
 levels in sepsis patients. METHODS: 152 sepsis patients and 150 health
 controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Plasma and serum samples were
 obtained from sepsis patients and HCs, and lncRNA NEAT1 expression in plasma
 was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while levels of
 inflammatory cytokines in serum were detected by enzyme linked immune sorbent
 assay. RESULTS: LncRNA NEAT1 expression was remarkably higher in sepsis
 patients than in HCs (P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
 disclosed a good predictive value of lncRNA NEAT1 expression for sepsis risk
 with area under curve (AUC) of 0.730 (95% CI: 0.740-0.861). Subsequent
 multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that lncRNA NEAT1
 expression was independently associated with higher sepsis risk (P<0.001). In
 sepsis patients, lncRNA NEAT1 expression was also observed to be positively
 correlated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II
 score (P<0.001), serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P<0.001), interleukin
 (IL)-1beta (P=0.043), IL-6 (P=0.001) and IL-8 (P=0.038), while negatively
 correlated with IL-10 (P<0.001). In addition, lncRNA NEAT1 expression was
 increased in non-survivors compared to survivors (P=0.006), and ROC curve
 revealed a good prognostic value of lncRNA NEAT1 for non-survivor risk with
 AUC 0.641 (95% CI: 0.536-0.746). CONCLUSION: Circulating lncRNA NEAT1
 correlates with increased disease risk, elevated severity and unfavorable
 prognosis as well as higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
 sepsis patients.",
