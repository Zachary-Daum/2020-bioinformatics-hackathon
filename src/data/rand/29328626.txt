    abstract "beta-particle emitting radionuclides are useful molecular labels
 due to their abundance in biomolecules. Detection of beta-emission from (3)H,
 (35)S, and (33)P, important biological isotopes, is challenging due to the
 low energies (Emax </= 300 keV) and short penetration depths (</=0.6 mm) in
 aqueous media. The activity of biologically relevant beta-emitters is usually
 measured in liquid scintillation cocktail (LSC), a mixture of
 energy-absorbing organic solvents, surfactants, and scintillant fluorophores,
 which places significant limitations on the ability to acquire time-resolved
 measurements directly in aqueous biological systems. As an alternative to
 LSC, we developed polystyrene-core, silica-shell nanoparticle scintillators
 (referred to as nanoSCINT) for quantification of low-energy beta-particle
 emitting radionuclides directly in aqueous solutions. The polystyrene acts as
 an absorber for energy from emitted beta-particles and can be loaded with a
 range of hydrophobic scintillant fluorophores, leading to photon emission at
 visible wavelengths. The silica shell serves as a hydrophilic shield for the
 polystyrene core, enabling dispersion in aqueous media and providing better
 compatibility with water-soluble analytes. While polymer and inorganic
 scintillating microparticles are commercially available, their large size
 and/or high density complicates effective dispersion throughout the sample
 volume. In this work, nanoSCINT nanoparticles were prepared and
 characterized. nanoSCINT responds to (3)H, (35)S, and (33)P directly in
 aqueous solutions, does not exhibit a change in scintillation response
 between pH 3.0 and 9.5 or with 100 mM NaCl, and can be recovered and reused
 for activity measurements in bulk aqueous samples, demonstrating the
 potential for reduced production of LSC waste and reduced total waste volume
 during radionuclide quantification. The limits of detection for 1 mg/mL
 nanoSCINT are 130 nCi/mL for (3)H, 8 nCi/mL for (35)S, and <1 nCi/mL for
 (33)P.",
