    abstract "Seven drugs from different classes, namely, fluoroquinolones
 (enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sarafloxacin), sulfonamides (sulfadimidine,
 sulfamonomethoxine), and macrolides (tilmicosin, tylosin), were used as test
 compounds in chickens by oral administration, a simple extraction step after
 cryogenic freezing might allow the effective extraction of multi-class
 veterinary drug residues from minced chicken muscles by mix vortexing. On
 basis of the optimized freeze-thaw approach, a convenient, selective, and
 reproducible liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was
 developed. At three spiking levels in blank chicken and medicated chicken
 muscles, average recoveries of the analytes were in the range of 71-106 and
 63-119%, respectively. All the relative standard deviations were <20%. The
 limits of quantification of analytes were 0.2-5.0 ng/g. Regardless of the
 chicken levels, there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the
 average contents of almost any of the analytes in medicated chickens between
 this method and specific methods in the literature for the determination of
 specific analytes. Finally, the developed method was successfully extended to
 the monitoring of residues of 55 common veterinary drugs in food animal
 muscles.",
