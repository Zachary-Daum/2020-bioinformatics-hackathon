    abstract "BACKGROUND: Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become the
 standard treatment for central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), its mechanism
 of action remains unclear. It is assumed that PDT induces short-term
 choriocapillaris (CC) occlusion and long-term choroidal vascular remodeling.
 In this paper, we describe the short-term CC changes induced by Half-Dose PDT
 (HD-PDT) in chronic CSC using optical coherence tomography-angiography
 (OCTA). METHODS: This is a prospective interventional case series. Chronic
 CSC eyes underwent Spectral-Domain OCT, Fundus Autofluorescence, FA, ICGA
 (Heidelberg Spectralis, Heidelberg, Germany) and OCTA (RTVue XR Avanti with
 AngioVue; Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) before HD-PDT, with follow-up after
 one hour, one week, and one month. Vascular changes after PDT were analyzed
 within the CC layer. The CC vessel density was defined as the percentage of
 an area occupied by flow pixels, using Image J software to obtain
 measurements by applying a grey level threshold. All pixels with a grey level
 above the threshold were considered as indicators of blood flow. RESULTS: 20
 eyes of 19 patients were included. At baseline the mean CC vessel density was
 94.87 +/- 2.32%. It significantly differed from the density at 1 week and 1
 month (92.79 +/- 3.16% and 95.55 +/- 2.05%, p < 0.001, respectively), but not
 with values at 1 h (94.8 +/- 2.28%, p = 0.516). CONCLUSIONS: CC vessel
 density was significantly reduced at 1 week as compared with baseline,
 suggesting a possible short-term effect of PDT on CC perfusion. After 1 month
 however, the CC vessel density was even higher than the baseline, probably
 due to a CC recovery. OCTA seems to be useful in the visualization of CC
 vessels and in confirming the mechanism of action of PDT treatment in eyes
 with chronic CSC.",
