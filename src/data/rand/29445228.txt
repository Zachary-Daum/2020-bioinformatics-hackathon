    abstract "In this paper, DSC curves at different heating rates were
 measured by DSC, the characteristic curing temperature was determined, and
 the optimum curing conditions were obtained. The KAS method, Friedman method
 and FWO method were used to analyze the DSC curves respectively. The kinetic
 parameters and the reaction mechanism function of the curing system were
 obtained, and the results of different analytical methods were compared and
 analyzed. Result from fitting and verification of the curing kinetic model
 for the curing system of the nano-phase modified epoxy resin further
 demonstrates that the nano-particle could play a catalytic role in the curing
 reaction of the epoxy resin and could reduce the apparent activation energy
 of the system, thus it is considered as a breakthrough in the field of resin
 research.",
