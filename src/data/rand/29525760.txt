    abstract "A 27-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency room
 with complaints of sweating, palpitations, heat intolerance, insomnia and
 weight loss for the last 3 months. His medical history was significant for
 hypertension. On examination, he was tachycardic, hypertensive, had tremors
 of the upper extremities and a smooth goitre with a thyroid bruit. Laboratory
 assessment revealed a suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, high free
 thyroxine and positive thyroid receptor antibodies. Complete blood count
 showed pancytopenia. As part of the work-up for pancytopenia, haptoglobin,
 ferritin, Coombs test, reticulocyte count hepatitis B and C antibodies were
 done, all of which were normal. Patient was started on methimazole,
 propranolol and hydrocortisone. His symptoms improved through the hospital
 course and he was subsequently discharged. Thyroidectomy was done once the
 patient's hyperthyroidism was controlled. Levothyroxine was started for the
 control of postsurgical hypothyroidism. Six months after thyroidectomy, the
 patient was euthyroid and the pancytopenia resolved.",
