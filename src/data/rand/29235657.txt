    abstract "Lipid-bilayer-encapsulated nanoparticles (LBLENPs) or
 NP-supported LBL systems, such as protocells (which are lipid bilayer
 encapsulated mesoporous silica nanoparticles or MSNPs) have received
 extensive attention for applications like targeted drug and gene deliveries,
 multimodal diagnostics, characterization of membrane-geometry sensitive
 molecules, etc. Very often electrostatic-mediated interactions have been
 hypothesized to play key roles in the functioning of these LBLENPs. Despite
 that, very little has been done to theoretically quantify the fundamental
 electric double layer (EDL) electrostatics of such LBLENPs. In this study, we
 develop an EDL theory to describe the electrostatics of such LBLENPs. We show
 that the electrostatics is a manifestation of the charged/dielectric nature
 of the NP, LBL structure and charging, and the ionic environment in which the
 LBLENPs are present. We also establish that for certain conditions of
 charging of the NP one witnesses a most remarkable charge inversion like
 electrostatics within the LBL membrane or the NP itself. We anticipate that
 our findings will provide an extremely useful platform for better
 understanding the fabrication and functioning of such LBLENPs and discuss
 examples where our theory can be useful.",
