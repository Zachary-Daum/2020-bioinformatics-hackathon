    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) is relatively
 contraindicated in cirrhotic portal hypertension (CPH) patients with
 complicating hypersplenic splenomegaly (HS). This study aimed to evaluate the
 effectiveness and safety of incorporation of iodized oil and gelatin sponge
 embolization to conventional splenic artery embolization (cSAE) with coiling
 in CPH/HS patients undergoing LS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2012
 and March 2014, eligible CPH/HS patients (n = 56) were assigned to
 preoperative modified SAE (mSAE) with LS (mSAE+LS group, n = 16), cSAE with
 LS (cSAE+LS group, n = 20) or LS alone (LS group, n = 20). Main outcome
 measures included frequency of conversion to laparotomy, operative time,
 intraoperative bleeding, and transfusion. RESULTS: The three groups had
 similar baseline characteristics (all P > .05). mSAE and cSAE similarly
 decreased LS conversion frequency (mSAE+LS versus cSAE+LS versus LS, 0.0%
 versus 10.0% versus 30.0%, P = .030) and operative time (155 +/- 23 minutes
 versus 170 +/- 26 minutes versus 221 +/- 42 minutes, P < .001) compared with
 LS alone. mSAE significantly reduced bleeding (178 +/- 22 mL versus 250 +/-
 27 mL versus 328 +/- 67 mL, P < .001) compared with cSAE and LS alone. The
 three groups had similar postoperative recovery times and surgical
 morbidities (all P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: In CPH/HS patients, preoperative SAE
 reduced LS conversion frequency and reduced operative time compared with LS
 alone, while mSAE further decreased volume of blood loss.",
