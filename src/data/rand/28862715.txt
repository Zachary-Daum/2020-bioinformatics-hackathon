    abstract "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to elucidate the
 clinicopathological significance of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)
 expression in gliomas, including its incidence and prognostic role. In
 addition, we investigated the concordance between immunohistochemistry and
 polymerase chain reaction for determining the presence or absence of EZH2 in
 these tumors. METHODS: The current meta-analysis included 1,049 gliomas with
 various WHO tumor grades from 12 eligible studies, which were analyzed for
 positivity of EZH2 and correlation between EZH2 expression and prognosis.
 Subgroup analyses were performed based on detection methods and WHO tumor
 grades. RESULTS: We found the estimated positive rate of EZH2 in gliomas to
 be 0.663 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.549-0.761). There was no
 difference between immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction in
 determination of EZH2 positivity (0.706, 95% CI, 0.539-0.831 vs. 0.673, 95%
 CI, 0.472-0.825). The positive rate of EZH2 increased by increasing WHO tumor
 grade. EZH2 expression was significantly correlated with worse overall and
 progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.436, 95% CI, 1.350-4.393,
 and HR = 4.071, 95% CI, 1.325-12.508, respectively). The overall concordance
 rate between immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction was 0.885
 (95% CI, 0.300-0.993). CONCLUSIONS: EZH2 positivity was significantly
 correlated with WHO tumor grade and worse prognosis in gliomas.",
