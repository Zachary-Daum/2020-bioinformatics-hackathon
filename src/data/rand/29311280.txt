    abstract "Production of bacterial flagella is controlled by a multitiered
 regulatory system that coordinates the expression of 40 to 50 subunits and
 ordered assembly of these elaborate structures. Flagellar expression is
 environmentally controlled, presumably to optimize the benefits and
 liabilities of having these organelles on cell growth and survival. We
 recently reported a global survey of AlgU-dependent regulation and binding in
 Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 that included evidence for strong
 downregulation of many flagellar and chemotaxis motility genes. Here, we
 returned to those data to look for other AlgU-dependent influences on the
 flagellar regulatory network. We identified an AlgU-dependent antisense
 transcript expressed from within the fleQ gene, the master regulator of
 flagellar biosynthesis in Pseudomonas We tested whether expression of this
 antisense RNA influenced bacterial behavior and found that it reduces
 AlgU-dependent downregulation of motility. Importantly, this antisense
 expression influenced motility only under conditions in which AlgU was
 expressed. Comparative sequence analysis of the locus containing the
 antisense transcript's AlgU-dependent promoter in over 300 Pseudomonas
 genomes revealed sequence conservation in most strains that encode AlgU. This
 suggests that the antisense transcript plays an important role that is
 conserved across most of the genus Pseudomonas IMPORTANCE Pseudomonas
 syringae is a globally distributed host-specific bacterial pathogen that
 causes disease in a wide-range of plants. An elaborate gene expression
 regulation network controls flagellum production, which is important for
 proper flagellum assembly and a key aspect of certain lifestyle transitions.
 P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 uses flagellum-powered motility in the early
 stages of host colonization and adopts a sessile lifestyle after entering
 plant tissues, but the regulation of this transition is not understood. Our
 work demonstrates a link between regulation of motility and global
 transcriptional control that facilitates bacterial growth and disease in
 plants. Additionally, sequence comparisons suggest that this regulation
 mechanism is conserved in most members of the genus Pseudomonas.",
