    abstract "Morgan, AL, Laurent, CM, and Fullenkamp, AM. Comparison of
 V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak performance on a motorized vs. a nonmotorized
 treadmill. J Strength Cond Res 30(7): 1898-1905, 2016-Despite growing
 popularity of nonmotorized treadmills (NMTs), little data exist regarding
 responses during exercise testing using this equipment, which is important
 when providing an appropriate exercise prescription. The purpose of this
 study was to evaluate physiological and perceptual responses during peak
 graded exercise tests (GXTs) on a motorized treadmill (MT) vs. NMT.
 Volunteers (12 men and 12 women aged 18-35 years) performed 2 peak GXT
 sessions (1 MT and 1 NMT). Respiratory gases and heart rate (HR) were
 collected each minute; perceptual response was estimated (Borg's 6-20 rating
 of perceived exertion [RPE] scale) during the final 10 seconds of each stage.
 Peak values (i.e., V[Combining Dot Above]O2, HR, speed) were determined
 during the final 10 seconds of each test; ventilatory threshold (VT) was
 assessed using the V-slope method. Paired t-tests matching variables measured
 at each stage of the GXT identified significantly higher values on the NMT
 for V[Combining Dot Above]O2 83% of the time, HR 67% of the time, and RPE 25%
 of the time. Interestingly though, neither peak V[Combining Dot Above]O2
 (48.6 +/- 9.2 ml.kg.min vs. 47.8 +/- 8.9 ml.kg.min), peak HR (185 +/- 9 b.min
 vs. 188 +/- 10 b.min; p = 0.90), nor VT (72.7 +/- 5.7% vs. 73.8 +/- 5.4%)
 were significantly different on the NMT vs. the MT. However, significant
 differences were identified between NMT and MT tests for time to exhaustion
 (9:55 +/- 1:49 vs. 12:05 +/- 2:48; p < 0.01) and peak speed (8.0 +/- 0.9 mph
 vs. 9.2 +/- 1.4 mph; p < 0.01). Thus, although peak values obtained were
 similar between testing sessions on the NMT and MT, the majority of
 submaximal data were significantly different between trials. These
 differences are important when designing exercise prescriptions using
 submaximal values from NMT testing that may be inappropriately high or low at
 corresponding intensities during training. ",
