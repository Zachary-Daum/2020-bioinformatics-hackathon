    abstract "BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most
 effective treatment for patients suffering from major depression. However,
 its use is limited due to concerns about negative effects on cognition.
 Unilateral ECT is associated with transient cognitive side-effects, while
 case-controlled studies investigating the effect of bilateral ECT on
 cognition remain scarce. We investigate the effects of bilateral ECT on
 cognition in depression in a longitudinal case-controlled study. We
 hypothesize that adverse cognitive effects of bilateral ECT are transient
 rather than long-term. METHODS: A total of 48 depressed patients and 19
 controls were included in the study and assessed with a battery of cognitive
 tests, including tests of: working memory, verbal fluency, visuospatial
 abilities, verbal/visual memory and learning, processing speed, inhibition,
 attention and task-switching, and premorbid IQ. Patients underwent three
 cognitive assessments: at baseline (n=43), after ten ECT sessions
 (post-treatment; n=39) and six months after the tenth ECT session (follow-up;
 n=25). Healthy controls underwent the same cognitive assessment at baseline
 and after five-weeks. RESULTS: Within the patient group, transient adverse
 cognitive side-effects were observed for verbal memory and learning, and
 verbal fluency. None of the cognitive domains tested in this study showed
 persisting impairments. LIMITATIONS: A relatively high attrition rate is
 observed and autobiographical memory was not assessed. CONCLUSION: This study
 shows that bilateral ECT has negative cognitive effects on short-term. These
 effects could be explained by a decrease in cognitive performance, a lack of
 learning effects or a combination. However, the decrease in cognitive
 functioning appears to recover after six months.",
