    abstract "AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the validity of a
 formative feedback instrument for leaders of simulated resuscitations.
 METHODS: This is a prospective validation study with a fully crossed (person
 x scenario x rater) study design. The Concise Assessment of Leader Management
 (CALM) instrument was designed by pediatric emergency medicine and graduate
 medical education experts to be used off the shelf to evaluate and provide
 formative feedback to resuscitation leaders. Four experts reviewed 16 videos
 of in situ simulated pediatric resuscitations and scored resuscitation leader
 performance using the CALM instrument. The videos consisted of 4 pediatric
 emergency department resuscitation teams each performing in 4 pediatric
 resuscitation scenarios (cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, seizure, and
 sepsis). We report on content and internal structure (reliability) validity
 of the CALM instrument. RESULTS: Content validity was supported by the
 instrument development process that involved professional experience, expert
 consensus, focused literature review, and pilot testing. Internal structure
 validity (reliability) was supported by the generalizability analysis. The
 main component that contributed to score variability was the person (33%),
 meaning that individual leaders performed differently. The rater component
 had almost zero (0%) contribution to variance, which implies that raters were
 in agreement and argues for high interrater reliability. CONCLUSIONS: These
 results provide initial evidence to support the validity of the CALM
 instrument as a reliable assessment instrument that can facilitate formative
 feedback to leaders of pediatric simulated resuscitations.",
