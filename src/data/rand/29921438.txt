    abstract "OBJECTIVE: This guideline reviews the evidence relating to the
 potential benefits of the vaginal hysterectomy (VH) and supracervical
 hysterectomy (SCH) versus total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) with respect to
 postoperative sexual function, urinary function, and peri- and postoperative
 complications. Laparoscopic options are not included in this guideline.
 OPTIONS: Women considering hysterectomy for benign disease can be given the
 option of retaining the cervix or proceeding with a total hysterectomy.
 OUTCOMES: The outcomes measured are postoperative sexual function and urinary
 function, and peri- and postoperative complications. EVIDENCE: The Cochrane
 Library, Medline, and Embase were searched for articles published in English
 from January 1950 to March 2008 specifically comparing VH and SCH with TAH in
 the prevention of sexual dysfunction, urinary dysfunction, and peri- and
 postoperative complications. Results were restricted to systematic reviews,
 randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational
 studies. Additional publications were identified from the bibliographies of
 these articles. Randomized controlled trials were considered evidence of the
 highest quality, followed by cohort studies. Grey (unpublished) literature
 was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment
 and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice
 guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and
 international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The quality of evidence
 was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task
 Force on Preventive Health Care (Table). RECOMMENDATIONS: ",
