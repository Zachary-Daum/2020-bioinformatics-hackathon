    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment improves quality of life in
 patients with adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS). However, open ADS surgeries
 are complex, large magnitude operations associated with a high rate of
 complications. The lateral transpsoas interbody fusion technique is a less
 invasive alternative to open ADS surgery, but less invasive techniques tend
 to be more expensive. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost
 effectiveness of the transpsoas technique for patients with ADS over a
 12-month time horizon from a public payer perspective. METHODS: A
 cost-effectiveness analysis was performed based on a consecutive case series
 of patients who underwent ADS surgeries between 2006 and 2012. Effectiveness
 was expressed as the difference in patient reported preoperative and 12-month
 postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which was measured in
 quality-adjusted life years. Health-care resource use was tabulated based on
 a clinical chart review on an item-by-item basis. Unit cost data were
 obtained from published provincial costs in Alberta, Canada. All costs were
 adjusted to 2015 Canadian dollars. The base case analysis included costs for
 the surgery, initial hospitalization, and treatment for complications over a
 12-month follow-up period. The uncomplicated case analysis included costs for
 the surgery and initial hospitalization only. The joint uncertainty
 surrounding the cost and HRQOL differences was estimated using bootstrapping
 with 10,000 replicates. RESULTS: A total of 10 open technique and 12
 transpsoas technique T11-pelvis fusions were included in the analysis. In the
 base case analysis, the transpsoas technique was less costly compared with
 the open technique, total cost of $83,513 (95% CI: $72,772-$94,253) versus
 $111,381 (95% CI: $36,340-$186,423), respectively (incremental cost $27,869),
 and was associated with 0.06 more quality-adjusted life years and/or patient.
 However, in the uncomplicated case, the open technique was less costly
 compared with the transpsoas technique ($47,795 [95% CI: $39,003-$56,586] vs
 $76,510 [95% CI: $72,273-$80,746]), respectively, with an incremental cost of
 $28,715. Based on the probabilistic analysis of 10,000 bootstrap iterations
 for the base case analysis, the transpsoas technique was more effective and
 less costly compared with the open technique 57% of time. One-way
 deterministic sensitivity analysis by adjusting bone-morphogenetic protein-2
 dosage further improved cost effectiveness of the transpsoas technique by
 lowering overall costs. CONCLUSIONS: Transpsoas surgeries were associated
 with better outcomes in terms of HRQOL and lower costs over 1-year follow-up
 period compared with more invasive open technique. This study should be
 viewed as a pilot evaluation and should be replicated in a larger prospective
 multicenter controlled study.",
