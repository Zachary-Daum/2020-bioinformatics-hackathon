    abstract "OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether measured glomerular
 filtration rate (mGFR) is a risk factor for death and/or end-stage renal
 disease (ESRD) after heart transplantation (HTx). METHODS: All adult patients
 (n = 416) who underwent HTx between 1988 and 2010 were included. mGFR was
 performed both preoperatively and postoperatively as annual follow-up. Eight
 patients received a concomitant kidney transplant (KTx), and 15 underwent
 late KTx due to chronic renal failure after HTx. RESULTS: The mean drop in
 mGFR compared with the preoperative value was 12% during the first year after
 HTx. Preoperative mGFR was not predictive of mortality or ESRD. Older or the
 use of a ventricular assist device (VAD) were preoperative predictors of
 death. Long-term survival was significantly worse in the patients who
 experienced a >25% decrease in mGFR during the first year after
 transplantation. The need for acute postoperative renal replacement therapy
 (RRT) was associated with impaired survival but did not predict ESRD among
 survivors. On multivariable analyses, previous heart surgery, preoperative
 VAD, and a lower mGFR were all predictors of RRT. In the most recent period,
 death without previous ESRD was lower, and the only preoperative factors
 associated with ESRD by multivariable analyses were mechanical ventilation
 and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplantation mGFR was not
 predictive of mortality or ESRD after HTx, but necessitated simultaneous or
 late-stage KTx in this selected population of patients. However, patients
 with a decrease in >25% mGFR during the first year post-transplantation, as
 well as early postoperative dialysis-dependent acute renal dysfunction, had a
 poor prognosis. We suggest that patients with severely impaired kidney
 function, irrespective of pretransplantation renal function, still should be
 considered for HTx, but also encourage careful interpretation of our results
 given the selection bias involved in this population.",
