    abstract "Aim and Objectives: Aim of this study was to compare prospective
 effectiveness of arthrocentesis of temporomandibular joint by single- and
 double-needle technique in central India population. Materials and Methods:
 Out of 230 patients, 500 joints were included in the study and were randomly
 selected into two groups: single needle and double needle. Follow-up of
 patients were done as 1 week, 1 and 3 months. (The statistical analysis was
 done using SPSS [Statistical Package for Social Sciences] Version 15.0
 Statistical Analysis Software). Results: Both techniques were equally
 effective at reducing pain and increasing the maximal mouth opening. The
 single-needle technique was easier to perform and required a shorter
 operative time (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The results obtained indicate that
 single versus double arthrocentesis techniques were equally effective in
 reducing the pain and increasing the mouth opening and reducing the clicking
 sound. However, single-needle technique was easier to perform and required a
 shorter operative time.",
