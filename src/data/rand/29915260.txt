    abstract "Japanese encephalitis (JE) caused by Japanese encephalitis virus
 (JEV) poses a serious threat to the world's public health yet without a cure.
 Certain JEV-infected neural cells express a subset of previously identified
 intrinsic antiviral interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), indicating brain
 cells retain autonomous antiviral immunity. However, whether this happens in
 composited brain remains unclear. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived
 organoids can model disorders caused by human endemic pathogens such as Zika
 virus, which may potentially address this question and facilitate the
 discovery of a cure for JE. We thus generated telencephalon organoid and
 infected them with JEV. We found JEV infection caused significant decline of
 cell proliferation and increase of cell death in brain organoid, resulting in
 smaller organoid spheres. JEV tended to infect astrocytes and neural
 progenitors, especially the population representing outer radial glial cells
 (oRGCs) of developing human brain. In addition, we revealed variable
 antiviral immunity in brain organoids of different stages of culture. In
 organoids of longer culture (older than 8 weeks), but not of early ones (less
 than 4 weeks), JEV infection caused typical activation of interferon
 signaling pathway. Preferential infection of oRGCs and differential antiviral
 response at various stages might explain the much more severe outcomes of JEV
 infection in the younger, which also provide clues to develop effective
 therapeutics of such diseases.",
