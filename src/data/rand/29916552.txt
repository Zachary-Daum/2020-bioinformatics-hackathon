    abstract "A large body of evidence has indicated that microRNAs
 (miRNAs/miRs) have essential roles in the development and progression of
 cervical cancer. Thus, miRNAs with dysregulated expression are potential
 biomarkers for cervical cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In the present study,
 expression levels of miR485 were detected in cervical cancer tissues and cell
 lines. The effects of miR485 overexpression on the proliferation and invasion
 of cervical cancer cells were determined with Cell Counting kit8 and
 Transwell invasion assays. The mechanisms underlying the action of miR485 in
 cervical cancer were investigated using bioinformatics analysis, a luciferase
 reporter assay, reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction
 and western blot analysis. In addition, the association between miR485 and
 metastasis associated in colon cancer1 (MACC1) in cervical cancer tissues was
 examined. The present study demonstrated that miR485 expression was
 significantly downregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines.
 Reduced miR485 expression in patients with cervical cancer was correlated
 with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and lymph
 node metastasis. Furthermore, restored expression of miR485 significantly
 reduced cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion. MACC1 was identified
 as a direct target gene of miR485 in cervical cancer. MACC1 expression was
 significantly upregulated in cervical cancer specimens and was inversely
 correlated with miR485 expression. Additionally, the restored expression of
 MACC1 eliminated the suppressive effects of miR485 overexpression on the
 proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Notably, the
 upregulation of miR485 suppressed the MET protooncogene, receptor tyrosine
 kinase (Met)/RACalpha serine/threonineprotein kinase (AKT) signaling pathway.
 These results demonstrated that miR485 may perform its tumor suppressive
 function in cervical cancer by directly targeting MACC1 and inhibiting the
 Met/AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, the miR485/MACC1 axis may be a novel
 and effective therapeutic target in cervical cancer.",
