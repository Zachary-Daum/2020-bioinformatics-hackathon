    abstract "BACKGROUND: Finding common molecular interactions from different
 samples is essential work to understanding diseases and other biological
 processes. Coexpression networks and their modules directly reflect
 sample-specific interactions among genes. Therefore, identification of common
 coexpression network or modules may reveal the molecular mechanism of complex
 disease or the relationship between biological processes. However, there has
 been no quantitative network comparison method for coexpression networks and
 we examined previous methods for other networks that cannot be applied to
 coexpression network. Therefore, we aimed to propose quantitative comparison
 methods for coexpression networks and to find common biological mechanisms
 between Huntington's disease and brain aging by the new method. RESULTS: We
 proposed two similarity measures for quantitative comparison of coexpression
 networks. Then, we performed experiments using known coexpression networks.
 We showed the validity of two measures and evaluated threshold values for
 similar coexpression network pairs from experiments. Using these similarity
 measures and thresholds, we quantitatively measured the similarity between
 disease-specific and aging-related coexpression modules and found similar
 Huntington's disease-aging coexpression module pairs. CONCLUSIONS: We
 identified similar Huntington's disease-aging coexpression module pairs and
 found that these modules are related to brain development, cell death, and
 immune response. It suggests that up-regulated cell signalling related cell
 death and immune/ inflammation response may be the common molecular
 mechanisms in the pathophysiology of HD and normal brain aging in the frontal
 cortex.",
