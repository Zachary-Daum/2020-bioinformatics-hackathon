    abstract "Background: This study examines the effect of interstitial
 inflammation and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy on renal survival
 in lupus nephritis. Methods: Baseline characteristics, initial (n = 301) and
 repeat biopsies (n = 94) and clinical outcomes for patients with
 biopsy-proven lupus nephritis from 1998 to 2014 were retrospectively
 collected from the medical record. Clinical and morphologic variables were
 evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model and multiple imputation to
 address missing data. Renal survival was defined as the time from initial
 biopsy to end-stage renal disease [estimated glomerular filtration rate
 (eGFR) <15 mL/min/1.73 m(2)], dialysis or transplant. Results: A total of 218
 patients had follow-up and Class IV had worse renal survival, especially in
 patients with active and chronic glomerular lesions {relative to non-IV;
 Class IV-A: hazard ratio [HR] 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-2.04],
 Class IV-AC: HR 5.02 [95% CI 2.70-9.36]}. Interstitial inflammation grade
 [relative to interstitial inflammation <5%; interstitial inflammation 5-25%:
 HR 2.36 (95% CI 1.13-4.91), interstitial inflammation 25-50%: HR 3.84 (95% CI
 1.53-9.62), interstitial inflammation >50%: HR 7.67 (95% CI 3.75-15.67)] and
 increased interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) category [relative
 to IFTA <5%; IFTA 5-25%: HR 3.93 (95% CI 1.58-9.75), IFTA 25-50%: HR 4.01
 (95% CI 1.37-11.70), IFTA >50%: HR 13.99 (95% CI 4.91-39.83)] predicted worse
 renal survival among all patients and those with Class IV on initial and
 repeat biopsy (n = 94) in a dose-dependent manner. Interstitial inflammation
 grade and IFTA category were significant predictors of renal survival in a
 multivariable model adjusted for age, gender, race, ethnicity and serum
 creatinine. Conclusions: Interstitial inflammation and IFTA independently
 affect renal survival and grading these lesions stratifies risk within the
 International Society of Nephrology and Renal Pathology Society
 classification of lupus nephritis.",
