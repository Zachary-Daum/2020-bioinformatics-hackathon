    abstract "Cofilin phospho-regulation is important for actin filament
 turnover and is implicated in cancer. Phosphorylation of cofilin is mediated
 by LIM kinases (LIMKs) and dephosphorylation by Slingshot phosphatases (SSH).
 LIMKs and SSH promote cancer cell invasion and metastasis and represent novel
 anti-cancer targets. However, little is known regarding LIMK/cofilin and SSH
 in human colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we aimed to address their
 expression and significance in human CRC. We evaluated expression of
 non-phosphorylated (active) and phosphorylated cofilin, LIMK1, LIMK2, and
 SSH1 by immunohistochemistry in 143 human CRC samples in relation to
 clinicopathologic parameters, response of metastatic disease to chemotherapy,
 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers beta-catenin, E-cadherin,
 and ZEB. We show that active cofilin, LIMK1, LIMK2, and SSH1 are
 overexpressed in human CRC and are associated with tumor progression
 parameters. SSH1 is an independent predictor of lymph node metastasis by
 multivariate analysis. LIMK1 and SSH1 expression is also higher in
 non-responders to chemotherapy, and SSH1 is shown by multivariate analysis to
 independently predict response of metastatic disease to chemotherapy. Active
 cofilin, LIMK1, LIMK2, and SSH1 also correlated with the EMT markers
 examined. In addition, immunofluorescence analysis showed increased
 expression of active cofilin, LIMK1, LIMK2, and SSH1 in HT29 colon cancer
 cells resistant to 5-fluorouracil compared to parental HT29 cells. Our
 results suggest that F-actin regulators LIMK/cofilin pathway and SSH1 are
 associated with CRC progression and chemoresistance representing promising
 tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets in CRC.",
