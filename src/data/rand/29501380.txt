    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Postobstructive diuresis (POD) is a polyuric state
 in which large quantities of salt and water are eliminated after solving a
 urinary tract obstruction. These patients are at increased risk of severe
 dehydration, electrolytic disturbances, hypovolemic shock, and death.
 Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the most common etiology of
 collecting system dilatation in the fetal kidney, and a significant number of
 patients require pyeloplasty. There are limited data regarding prognostic
 risk factors for POD in this scenario. OBJECTIVE: To describe possible
 clinical risk factors for POD in the pediatric population after open
 pyeloplasty. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective case series study of
 consecutive patients diagnosed with UPJO at three high complexity centers,
 managed with open pyeloplasty from 2006 to 2016. Multiple qualitative and
 quantitative variables possibly associated with POD were included according
 to the literature review. They were statistically analyzed with STATA 14
 software. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients with UPJO following open
 pyeloplasty were analyzed. Twenty-seven patients (30%) had POD. A tendency to
 present POD in younger patients was found, with a mean age of 20.2 months vs.
 72.3 months. There was also an increased risk of POD in patients with
 previous diagnosis of tubular acidosis. CONCLUSIONS: There are no data about
 prognostic clinical risk factors for POD after open pyeloplasty in the
 pediatric population. Our study corresponds to one of the larger series
 reported so far. It suggests that younger patients and patients with a
 previous diagnosis of tubular acidosis could be at greater risk of POD.
 Consequently, prospective studies are required for validation of our results,
 and possible impact on patient follow-up.",
