    abstract "Various responses to static magnetic fields (MF) have been
 reported in plants, and it has been suggested that the geomagnetic field
 influences plant physiology. Accordingly, diverse mechanisms have been
 proposed to mediate MF effects in plants. The currently most probable sensor
 candidates are cryptochromes (Cry) which are sensitive to submillitesla MF.
 Here, we propose a quantitative approach of the MF effect on Cry depending on
 light intensity, and try to link it to a possible functional role for
 magnetic sensitivity in plants. Based on a theoretical evaluation and on a
 review of relevant data on Arabidopsis thaliana Cry 1, we point out that the
 MF effect on the signaling state of Cry, as well as the possible consequences
 of that effect on certain phenotypes (growth in particular) show parallel
 dependences on light intensity, being most prominent at low light levels.
 Based on these findings, we propose that Cry magnetosensitivity in plants
 could represent an ecological adaptation which regulates the amount of Cry
 signaling state under low light conditions. That hypothesis would
 preferentially be tested by studying sensitive and specific endpoints, such
 as the expression of clock proteins that are downregulated by Cry, but under
 light intensities lower than those used so far. Finally, we highlight that
 the low-light dependence of the MF effect described here could also apply to
 light-dependent functions of animal Cry, in particular magnetoreception
 which, from the present evaluation, would be based on the magnetic
 sensitivity of the photoreduction reaction, like in plants.",
