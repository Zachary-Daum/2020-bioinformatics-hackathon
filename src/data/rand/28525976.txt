    abstract "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause
 of cancer-related death in men and women. Systemic disease with metastatic
 spread to distant sites such as the liver reduces the survival rate
 considerably. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in gene
 expression that occur on invasion and expansion of CRC cells when forming
 metastases in the liver. METHODS: The livers of syngeneic C57BL/6NCrl mice
 were inoculated with 1 million CRC cells (CMT-93) via the portal vein,
 leading to the stable formation of metastases within 4 weeks. RNA sequencing
 performed on the Illumina platform was employed to evaluate the expression
 profiles of more than 14,000 genes, utilizing the RNA of the cell line cells
 and liver metastases as well as from corresponding tumour-free liver.
 RESULTS: A total of 3329 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
 identified when cultured CMT-93 cells propagated as metastases in the liver.
 Hierarchical clustering on heat maps demonstrated the clear changes in gene
 expression of CMT-93 cells on propagation in the liver. Gene ontology
 analysis determined inflammation, angiogenesis, and signal transduction as
 the top three relevant biological processes involved. Using a selection list,
 matrix metallopeptidases 2, 7, and 9, wnt inhibitory factor, and chemokine
 receptor 4 were the top five significantly dysregulated genes. CONCLUSION:
 Bioinformatics assists in elucidating the factors and processes involved in
 CRC liver metastasis. Our results support the notion of an
 invasion-metastasis cascade involving CRC cells forming metastases on
 successful invasion and expansion within the liver. Furthermore, we
 identified a gene expression signature correlating strongly with invasiveness
 and migration. Our findings may guide future research on novel therapeutic
 targets in the treatment of CRC liver metastasis.",
