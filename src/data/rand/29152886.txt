    abstract "We review our work on a contrast-based computational model of
 surprise and its applications. The review is contextualized within related
 research from psychology, philosophy, and particularly artificial
 intelligence. Influenced by psychological theories of surprise, the model
 assumes that surprise-eliciting events initiate a series of cognitive
 processes that begin with the appraisal of the event as unexpected, continue
 with the interruption of ongoing activity and the focusing of attention on
 the unexpected event, and culminate in the analysis and evaluation of the
 event and the revision of beliefs. It is assumed that the intensity of
 surprise elicited by an event is a nonlinear function of the difference or
 contrast between the subjective probability of the event and that of the most
 probable alternative event (which is usually the expected event); and that
 the agent's behavior is partly controlled by actual and anticipated surprise.
 We describe applications of artificial agents that incorporate the proposed
 surprise model in three domains: the exploration of unknown environments,
 creativity, and intelligent transportation systems. These applications
 demonstrate the importance of surprise for decision making, active learning,
 creative reasoning, and selective attention.",
