    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Breach in the palatal vault leading to an abnormal
 communication between oral and nasal cavity is known as oro-nasal
 communication. It is an uncommon presentation in day-to-day clinical practice
 except in some patients of cleft lip and palate.Etiology may be congenital or
 acquired. Alveolar and palatal cleft defects are the most common etiological
 factor. The acquired causes may be trauma, periapical pathology, infections,
 neoplasms, postsurgical complications, and radio and chemo necrosis.Clinical
 features like nasal regurgitation of food, defective speech, fetid odor, bad
 taste, and upper respiratory tract and ear infection are associated with
 oro-nasal communication.Management depends upon the size and site of defect,
 age of patient, and associated comorbidity. The definitive management is
 always surgical. Two layered closure provides greater support and stability
 and reduces the risk of failure. Palatal rotational flaps are suitable for
 smaller defects. The other local flaps are buccal mucosal flap, tongue flap,
 and facial artery myomucosal flap. Temporoparietal galeal flap, turbinate
 flap, free radial forearm flap, and scapular flap have also been successfully
 used for closure of oronasal communication. Newer procedures like the use of
 bone morphogenic protein, acellular dermal matrices, human amniotic membrane,
 and distraction osteogenesis have been tried successfully. The rate of
 recurrence is high.Unsuccessful surgical attempts and larger defects
 associated with compromised medical conditions are better managed
 nonsurgically with obturator incorporating the missing teeth.",
