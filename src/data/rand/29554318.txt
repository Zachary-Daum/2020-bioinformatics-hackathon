    abstract "OBJECTIVES: Nonsmoking status and physical activity have,
 individually, been shown to be associated with health-related quality of life
 (HRQoL). The objective of this study was to assess whether the relationship
 between smoking status and HRQoL is modified or influenced by physical
 activity. METHODS: Data were extracted from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor
 Surveillance Survey dataset (N = 332680) in 2015. Logistic regression models
 were used to address study objectives. Health-related quality of life
 (HRQoL), measured using eight domains (general health, physical health,
 mental health, activity limitations, pain, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and
 vitality), was regressed on smoking status without and with adjustment for
 age, race, gender, education, marital status, income, employment, healthcare
 coverage, comorbidity, body mass index, flu vaccination, alcohol use, and
 physical activity. Smoking status by physical activity interaction term was
 added to the adjusted model and evaluated for significance. RESULTS: There
 were significant smoking status by physical activity interaction effects on
 general health, physical health, activity limitations, and depressive
 symptoms domains. Among those who exercised, relative differences in the odds
 of a high HRQoL was smaller between former smokers and nonsmokers and larger
 between current smokers and nonsmokers when compared to those who did not
 exercise. Similarly, there were sharper relative differences between those
 who exercised and those who did not exercise among former smokers than among
 current smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers who successfully quit smoking (former
 smokers) may benefit from enhanced HRQoL that tends towards that of
 nonsmokers if they adopt physical activity in their daily routine.
 IMPLICATIONS: Behavioral interventions that combine smoking cessation and
 physical activity may be more effective than either smoking cessation or
 physical activity alone in improving the quality of life measures such as
 overall, physical and mental health, and degree of limitation to activities
 due to poor health. Health care providers can support patients who
 successfully quit smoking to add exercise to their daily routine with the
 expectation of enhanced HRQoL.",
