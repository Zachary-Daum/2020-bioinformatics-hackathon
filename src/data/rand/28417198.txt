    abstract "The Web 2.0 enabled collaboration at an unprecedented level. In
 one of the flagships of mass collaboration-Wikipedia-a large number of
 authors socially negotiate the world's largest compendium of knowledge.
 Several guidelines in Wikipedia restrict contributions to verifiable
 information from reliable sources to ensure recognized knowledge. Much
 psychological research demonstrates, however, that individual information
 processing is biased. This poses the question whether individual biases
 translate to Wikipedia articles or whether they are prevented by its
 guidelines. The present research makes use of hindsight bias to examine this
 question. To this end, we analyzed foresight and hindsight versions of
 Wikipedia articles regarding a broad variety of events (Study 1). We found
 the majority of articles not to contain traces of hindsight bias-contrary to
 prior individual research. However, for a particular category of
 events-disasters-we found robust evidence for hindsight bias. In a lab
 experiment (Study 2), we then examined whether individuals' hindsight bias is
 translated into articles under controlled conditions and tested whether
 collaborative writing-as present in Wikipedia-affects the resultant bias (vs.
 individual writing). Finally, we investigated the impact of biased Wikipedia
 articles on readers (Study 3). As predicted, biased articles elicited a
 hindsight bias in readers, who had not known of the event previously.
 Moreover, biased articles also affected individuals who knew about the event
 already, and who had already developed a hindsight bias: biased articles
 further increased their hindsight.",
