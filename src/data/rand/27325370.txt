    abstract "AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aims of this integrative literature
 review are to define the role of a preoperative nurse and to describe the
 main components and hypothetical outcomes of a preoperative nursing care
 structure before a surgical patient arrives to an elective procedure.
 BACKGROUND: The development of medical care has impacted surgical processes,
 and patients are now spending less time in hospital settings. Patients often
 enter the hospital on the day of a procedure and are discharged as soon as it
 is medically safe, creating challenges for nursing care. Preoperative clinics
 have been opened, and the importance of preoperative nursing care has been
 widely understood. Previous literature has provided descriptions about the
 roles, tasks and outcomes of preoperative nurses; however, the terminology is
 heterogeneous, and the optimal model remains unknown. DESIGN: A systematic
 procedure for searching, selecting, and evaluating the literature was
 followed. The data were collected from PubMed and CINAHL between 1 January
 2004 and 20 September 2014. In total, 41 articles were included in the study
 and were analysed by qualitative inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The
 data provided seven main tasks of a preoperative nurse, tools to support
 preoperative nursing and outcomes of structured preoperative nursing care.
 CONCLUSION: A preoperative nurse is a specialised coordinator of patient
 care, and the main purposes of this role are to meet the patient's and the
 family's needs individually and to prepare them for the scheduled procedure
 and postoperative recovery. By following the structure of the seven main
 tasks and using different supportive tools, preoperative nursing can
 positively impact patient and provider satisfaction, patient safety, quality
 of care and cost savings. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A preoperative
 nursing care structure should be implemented in clinical practice and then
 evaluated to measure whether the hypothetical outcomes reported in this
 literature review can be achieved.",
