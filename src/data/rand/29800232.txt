    abstract "MOTIVATION: The importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) is widely
 recognized in the community nowadays because these short segments of RNA can
 play several roles in almost all biological processes. The computational
 prediction of novel miRNAs involves training a classifier for identifying
 sequences having the highest chance of being precursors of miRNAs
 (pre-miRNAs). The big issue with this task is that well-known pre-miRNAs are
 usually few in comparison with the hundreds of thousands of candidate
 sequences in a genome, which results in high class imbalance. This imbalance
 has a strong influence on most standard classifiers, and if not properly
 addressed in the model and the experiments, not only performance reported can
 be completely unrealistic but also the classifier will not be able to work
 properly for pre-miRNA prediction. Besides, another important issue is that
 for most of the machine learning (ML) approaches already used (supervised
 methods), it is necessary to have both positive and negative examples. The
 selection of positive examples is straightforward (well-known pre-miRNAs).
 However, it is difficult to build a representative set of negative examples
 because they should be sequences with hairpin structure that do not contain a
 pre-miRNA. RESULTS: This review provides a comprehensive study and
 comparative assessment of methods from these two ML approaches for dealing
 with the prediction of novel pre-miRNAs: supervised and unsupervised
 training. We present and analyze the ML proposals that have appeared during
 the past 10 years in literature. They have been compared in several
 prediction tasks involving two model genomes and increasing imbalance levels.
 This work provides a review of existing ML approaches for pre-miRNA
 prediction and fair comparisons of the classifiers with same features and
 data sets, instead of just a revision of published software tools. The
 results and the discussion can help the community to select the most adequate
 bioinformatics approach according to the prediction task at hand. The
 comparative results obtained suggest that from low to mid-imbalance levels
 between classes, supervised methods can be the best. However, at very high
 imbalance levels, closer to real case scenarios, models including
 unsupervised and deep learning can provide better performance.",
