    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To assess accuracy and safety of self-developed
 customized guiding templates for cervical pedicle screw (CPS) insertion
 surgery. METHODS: From July 2016 to December 2017, 57 screws were implanted
 in 9 patients with the assistance of customized guiding templates. Customized
 guiding templates were manufactured from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene
 plastic material using a three-dimensional printer after establishing pedicle
 screw trajectories for each vertebra with the assistance of a virtual
 surgical planning software program, developed by our team, for the insertion
 of CPSs. RESULTS: CPSs were evaluated using the following grading system:
 grade 0 (contained), grade 1 (exposure), grade 2 (perforation), and grade 3
 (penetration). Each patient underwent postoperative computed tomography to
 evaluate accuracy of screw position. Of 57 screws, 54 were graded 0, and 3
 were graded 1; no screws were graded 2 or 3. No vascular or nerve injuries
 were noted after the operations. CONCLUSIONS: CPSs, which provide strong
 biologic strength, are especially suitable for treating osteoporosis and
 severe deformity. However, CPS insertion remains a challenging procedure with
 high incidences of vascular and nerve injuries reported. The results of this
 study indicate that use of customized guiding templates can improve safety of
 CPS insertion surgery.",
