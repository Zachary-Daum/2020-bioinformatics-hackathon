    abstract "Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by brain hypotrophy and
 intellectual disability starting from early life stages. Accumulating
 evidence shows that the phenotypic features of the DS brain can be traced
 back to the fetal period since the DS brain exhibits proliferation potency
 reduction starting from the critical time window of fetal neurogenesis. This
 defect is worsened by the fact that neural progenitor cells exhibit reduced
 acquisition of a neuronal phenotype and an increase in the acquisition of an
 astrocytic phenotype. Consequently, the DS brain has fewer neurons in
 comparison with the typical brain. Although apoptotic cell death may be
 increased in DS, this does not seem to be the major cause of brain
 hypocellularity. Evidence obtained in brains of individuals with DS,
 DS-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and DS mouse models has
 provided some insight into the mechanisms underlying the developmental
 defects due to the trisomic condition. Although many triplicated genes may be
 involved, in the light of the studies reviewed here, DYRK1A, APP, RCAN1 and
 OLIG1/2 appear to be particularly important determinants of many
 neurodevelopmental alterations that characterize DS because their
 triplication affects both the proliferation and fate of neural precursor
 cells as well as apoptotic cell death. Based on the evidence reviewed here,
 pathways downstream to these genes may represent strategic targets, for the
 design of possible interventions.",
