    abstract "Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third
 leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. South Korea is in first place with
 9,180 death alone attributed to gastric cancer in 2013. Plenty of literature
 suggests the evasion of apoptosis is implicated in neurodegeneration,
 autoimmune diseases, and tumors development due to dysregulation in the
 apoptotic mechanism. Reduced apoptosis or its resistance in cancer cells
 plays a significant role in carcinogenesis. It's imperative to understand
 apoptosis, which provides the basis for novel targeted therapies that can
 induce cancer cell death or sensitize them to cytotoxic agents by regulating
 key factors like IAPs, MDM2, p53, caspases and much more. Studies have
 demonstrated that Scutellarein have the ability to inhibit several cancer
 cells by inducing apoptosis with both: Scutellarein monomers as well as
 scutellarein containing flavonoids. MTT results revealed that scutellarein
 inhibited cell viability in both dose and time dependent manner. Flow
 cytometry and western blot analysis showed that scutellarein induces
 apoptosis in both AGS and SNU-484 human gastric cancer cells and G2/M phase
 cell cycle arrest in SNU-484 cells. This study demonstrated that the
 Scutellarein on AGS and SNU-484 cells significantly inhibits cell
 proliferation and induces apoptotic cell death via down regulating MDM2 and
 activated the tumor suppresser protein p53, subsequently down regulating the
 IAP family proteins (cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP) leading to caspase-dependent
 apoptosis in AGS and SNU-484 cells.",
