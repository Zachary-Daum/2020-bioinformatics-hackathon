    abstract "The present study aimed to elucidate the role of
 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and angiogenesis in tumor progression by
 assessing their immunohistochemical expression in oral epithelial dysplasia
 (OED), oral verrucous carcinoma (OVC), and oral squamous cell carcinoma
 (OSCC). About 20 histopathologically confirmed cases of OED, OVC, and OSCC
 each and 10 cases of normal oral mucosa taken as controls were stained
 immunohistochemically using CD68 and CD31 antibodies. The average TAM count
 and the microvessel density (MVD) were calculated for each group and
 expressed as mean+/-SD and compared using the Mann-Whitney U Test. Pearson
 correlation was applied to assess the correlation between TAM and MVD in
 different groups. The CD68 count was found to be significantly higher in all
 the groups as compared with controls, with the highest counts in OSCC,
 followed by OED and OVC. MVD was significantly higher in all the test groups
 as compared with controls. The increase in MVD was highly significant in OSCC
 as compared with OVC, and in OVC as compared with OED. No association could
 be determined between TAM and MVD. There does not seem to be any direct
 influence of macrophages on angiogenesis in the microenvironment of OED, OVC,
 and OSCC.",
