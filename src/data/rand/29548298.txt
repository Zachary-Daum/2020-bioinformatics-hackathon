    abstract "BACKGROUND: Specific phobias are among the most common anxiety
 disorders. Exposure therapy is the treatment of choice for specific phobias.
 However, not all patients respond equally well to it. Hence, current research
 focuses on therapeutic add-ons to increase and consolidate the effects of
 exposure therapy. One potential therapeutic add-on is biofeedback to increase
 heart rate variability (HRV). A recent meta-analysis shows beneficial effects
 of HRV biofeedback interventions on stress and anxiety symptoms. Therefore,
 the purpose of the current trial is to evaluate the effects of HRV
 biofeedback, which is practiced before and utilized during exposure, in
 spider-fearful individuals. Further, this trial is the first to differentiate
 between the effects of a HRV biofeedback intervention and those of a low-load
 working memory (WM) task. METHODS: Eighty spider-fearful individuals
 participate in the study. All participants receive a training session in
 which they practice two tasks (HRV biofeedback and a motor pseudo-biofeedback
 task or two motor pseudo-biofeedback tasks). Afterwards, they train both
 tasks at home for 6 days. One week later, during the exposure session, they
 watch 16 1-min spider video clips. Participants are divided into four groups:
 group 1 practices the HRV biofeedback and one motor pseudo-task before
 exposure and utilizes HRV biofeedback during exposure. Group 2 receives the
 same training, but continues the pseudo-biofeedback task during exposure.
 Group 3 practices two pseudo-biofeedback tasks and continues one of them
 during exposure. Group 4 trains in two pseudo-biofeedback tasks and has no
 additional task during exposure. The primary outcome is fear of spiders
 (measured by the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire and the Behavioral Approach
 Test). Secondary outcomes are physiological measures based on electrodermal
 activity, electrocardiogram and respiration. DISCUSSION: This RCT is the
 first one to investigate the effects of using a pre-trained HRV biofeedback
 during exposure in spider-fearful individuals. The study critically contrasts
 the effects of the biofeedback intervention with those of pseudo-tasks, which
 also require WM capacity, but which do not have a physiological base. If HRV
 biofeedback is effective in reducing fear of spiders, it would represent an
 easy-to-use tool to improve exposure-therapy outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
