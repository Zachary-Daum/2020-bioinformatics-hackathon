    abstract "Background: In Meghalaya, only 51.4% expectant mothers go for
 any institutional delivery with a wide rural-urban gap causing morbidity and
 mortality in the mothers and the neonates. Objectives: The objective of this
 study is to find out the factors influencing the choice of the place of
 delivery in rural women. Methodology: The present qualitative cross-sectional
 study was conducted from October to December 2016 in Bhoirymbong community
 health center (CHC) and the area catered to by it. This CHC was selected by
 purposive sampling. Data collection methods included focused group
 discussions and in-depth interviews. The data were analyzed manually using
 thematic content analysis. Results: Most of the women in the study area opted
 for home delivery by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), on whose skills the
 community had strong faith. Financial constraints, fear of out-of-pocket
 expenditure, ignorance of available schemes, unavailability of transport, bad
 roads, and distant hospitals were found to be important causes of this
 choice. Home delivery apparently offered the women privacy and the
 opportunity to attend to their household chores and older children.
 Illiteracy, increasing age, and parity were risk factors for home delivery.
 Perceived need for institutional delivery was low. Staff attitudes and
 unnecessary referrals had an impact on the choice of place of delivery.
 Conclusion: In the rural areas of this study, home deliveries are the
 preferred norm. The wide range of factors identified in this study for the
 preference of TBA and home deliveries could help policy makers and program
 implementers to adopt socially and culturally appropriate community-based
 interventions that can contribute to the reduction of maternal, fetal, and
 neonatal mortality and morbidity and increase service utilization.",
