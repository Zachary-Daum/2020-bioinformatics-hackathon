    abstract "The structure and function of soil microbial communities have
 been widely used as indicators of soil quality and fertility. The effect of
 biochar application on carbon sequestration has been studied, but the effect
 on soil microbial functional diversity has received little attention. We
 evaluated effects of biochar application on the functional diversities of
 microbes in a loam soil. The effects of biochar on microbial activities and
 related processes in the 0-10 and 10-20cm soil layers were determined in a
 two-year experiment in maize field on the Loess Plateau in China.
 Low-pyrolysis biochar produced from maize straw was applied into soils at
 rates of 0 (BC0), 10 (BC10) and 30 (BC30)tha(-1). Chemical analysis indicated
 that the biochar did not change the pH, significantly increased the amounts
 of organic carbon and nitrogen, and decreased the amount of mineral nitrogen
 and the microbial quotient. The biochar significantly decreased average well
 colour development (AWCD) values in Biolog EcoPlates for both layers,
 particularly for the rate of 10tha(-1). Biochar addition significantly
 decreased substrate richness (S) except for BC30 in the 0-10cm layer. Effects
 of biochar on the Shannon-Wiener index (H) and Simpson's dominance (D) were
 not significant, except for a significant increase in evenness index (E) in
 BC10 in the 10-20cm layer. A principal component analysis clearly
 differentiated the treatments, and microbial use of six categories of
 substrates significantly decreased in both layers after biochar addition,
 although the use of amines and amides did not differ amongst the three
 treatments in the deeper layer. Maize above ground dry biomass and height did
 not differ significantly amongst the treatments, and biochar had no
 significant effect on nitrogen uptake by maize seedlings. H was positively
 correlated with AWCD, and negatively with pH. AWCD was positively correlated
 with mineral N and negatively with pH. Our results indicated that shifts in
 soil microbial functional diversity affected by biochar were not effective
 indicators of soil quality in earlier maize growth periods in this region.",
