    abstract "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an
 intervention program to improve executive functions and enhance the planning
 abilities of patients with mild neurocognitive disorder. DESIGN: A pilot
 intervention study. METHODS: Ten inpatients performed an intervention program
 based on Lezak's conceptual model that teaches task-specific routines. The
 program consisted of six training sessions presented over a 2-week period.
 Neuropsychological assessments were performed pre- and postintervention.
 FINDINGS: The postintervention scores of the Behavioral Assessment of
 Dysexecutive Syndrome Total Profile and two subtests were significantly
 higher than the preintervention scores. The instrumental Activities of Daily
 Living Scale and the Visual Analog Scale were significantly improved.
 CONCLUSION: This intervention program leads to improvement in the executive
 function of planning ability and promotes independence and self-confidence in
 patients with mild neurocognitive disorder. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinicians
 should consider the program in terms of improving the executive dysfunction,
 and the process of planning and the process of actual practice are important.",
