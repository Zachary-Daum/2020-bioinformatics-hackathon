    abstract "Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 2 (TIF2) is a key Androgen
 receptor (AR) coactivator that has been implicated in the development and
 progression of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This chapter
 describes the implementation of an AR-TIF2 protein-protein interaction (PPI)
 biosensor assay to screen for small molecules that can induce AR-TIF2 PPIs,
 inhibit the DHT-induced formation of AR-TIF2 PPIs, or disrupt pre-existing
 AR-TIF2 PPIs. The biosensor assay employs high content imaging and analysis
 to quantify AR-TIF2 PPIs and integrates physiologically relevant cell-based
 assays with the specificity of binding assays by incorporating structural
 information from AR and TIF2 functional domains along with intracellular
 targeting sequences using fluorescent protein reporters. Expression of the
 AR-Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) ""prey"" and TIF2-Green Fluorescent Protein
 (GFP) ""bait"" components of the biosensor is directed by recombinant
 adenovirus (rAV) expression constructs that facilitated a simple co-infection
 protocol to produce homogeneous expression of both biosensors that is
 scalable for screening. In untreated cells, AR-RFP expression is localized
 predominantly to the cytoplasm and TIF2-GFP expression is localized only in
 the nucleoli of the nucleus. Exposure to DHT induces the co-localization of
 AR-RFP within the TIF2-GFP positive nucleoli of the nucleus. The AR-TIF2
 biosensor assay therefore recapitulates the ligand-induced translocation of
 latent AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and the PPIs between AR and TIF2
 result in the colocalization of AR-RFP within TIF2-GFP expressing nucleoli.
 The AR-TIF2 PPI biosensor approach offers significant promise for identifying
 molecules with potential to modulate AR transcriptional activity in a
 cell-specific manner that may overcome the development of resistance and
 progression to CRPC.",
