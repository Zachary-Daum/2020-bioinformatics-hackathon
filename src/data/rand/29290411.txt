    abstract "Prescription omega-3 fatty acid ethyl ester supplements are
 commonly used for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. However, the
 metabolic profile and effect of the metabolites formed by these treatments
 remain unknown. Here we utilized unbiased metabolomics to identify
 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) as a significant
 metabolite of the omega-3-acid ethyl ester prescription Lovaza in humans.
 Administration of CMPF to mice before or after high-fat diet feeding at
 exposures equivalent to those observed in humans increased whole-body lipid
 metabolism, improved insulin sensitivity, increased beta-oxidation, reduced
 lipogenic gene expression, and ameliorated steatosis. Mechanistically, we
 find that CMPF acutely inhibits ACC activity, and induces long-term loss of
 SREBP1c and ACC1/2 expression. This corresponds to an induction of FGF21,
 which is required for long-term steatosis protection, as FGF21KO mice are
 refractory to the improved metabolic effects. Thus, CMPF treatment in mice
 parallels the effects of human Lovaza supplementation, revealing that CMPF
 may contribute to the improved metabolic effects observed with omega-3 fatty
 acid prescriptions.",
