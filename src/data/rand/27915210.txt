    abstract "Since functional imaging of whole body movements is not feasible
 with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study presents
 in vivo functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a suitable technique
 to measure body movement effects on fronto-temporo-parietal cortical
 activation in single- and dual-task paradigms. Previous fNIRS applications in
 studies addressing whole body movements were typically limited to the
 assessment of prefrontal brain areas. The current study investigated brain
 activation in the frontal, temporal and parietal cortex of both hemispheres
 using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with two large 4x4
 probe-sets with 24 channels each during single and dual gait tasks. 12 young
 healthy adults were measured using fNIRS walking on a treadmill: the
 participants performed two single-task (ST) paradigms (walking at different
 speeds, i.e. 3 and 5km/h) and a dual task (DT) paradigm where a verbal
 fluency task (VFT) had to be executed while walking at 3km/h. The results
 show an increase of activation in Broca's area during the more advanced
 conditions (ST 5km/h vs. ST 3km/h, DT vs. ST 3km/h, DT vs. 5km/h), while the
 corresponding area on the right hemisphere was also activated. DT paradigms
 including a cognitive task in conjunction with whole body movements elicit
 wide-spread cortical activation patterns across fronto-temporo-parietal
 areas. An elaborate assessment of these activation patterns requires more
 extensive fNIRS assessments than the traditional prefrontal investigations,
 e.g. as performed with portable fNIRS devices.",
