    abstract "To identify baseline sound levels, patterns of sound levels, and
 potential barriers and facilitators to sound level reduction. The study
 setting was neonatal and pediatric intensive care units in a tertiary care
 hospital. Participants were staff in both units and parents of currently
 hospitalized children or infants. One 24-hour sound measurements and one
 4-hour sound measurement linked to observed sound events were conducted in
 each area of the center's neonatal intensive care unit. Two of each
 measurement type were conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit. Focus
 groups were conducted with parents and staff. Transcripts were analyzed with
 descriptive content analysis and themes were compared against results from
 quantitative measurements. Sound levels exceeded recommended standards at
 nearly every time point. The most common code was related to talking. Themes
 from focus groups included the critical care context and sound levels,
 effects of sound levels, and reducing sound levels-the way forward. Results
 are consistent with work conducted in other critical care environments. Staff
 and families realize that high sound levels can be a problem, but feel that
 the culture and context are not supportive of a quiet care space. High levels
 of ambient sound suggest that the largest changes in sound levels are likely
 to come from design and equipment purchase decisions. L10 and Lmax appear to
 be the best outcomes for measurement of behavioral interventions.",
