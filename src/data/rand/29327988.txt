    abstract "Voice assistants are software agents that can interpret human
 speech and respond via synthesized voices. Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa,
 Microsoft's Cortana, and Google's Assistant are the most popular voice
 assistants and are embedded in smartphones or dedicated home speakers. Users
 can ask their assistants questions, control home automation devices and media
 playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists,
 and calendars with verbal commands. This column will explore the basic
 workings and common features of today's voice assistants. It will also
 discuss some of the privacy and security issues inherent to voice assistants
 and some potential future uses for these devices. As voice assistants become
 more widely used, librarians will want to be familiar with their operation
 and perhaps consider them as a means to deliver library services and
 materials.",
