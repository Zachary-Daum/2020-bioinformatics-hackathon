    abstract "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of our study was to investigate the
 immunomodulatory effect and short-term efficacy and long-term prognosis of
 decompensated liver cirrhosis patients caused by hepatitis B after a double
 transplantation with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs).
 METHODS: Fifty inpatients were recruited and given the same medical
 treatments, receiving hUCMSCs injection intravenously. Fifty-three patients
 (Group B) matched for age, sex, and baseline alanine aminotransferase,
 aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and
 model for end-stage liver disease score and Child-Pugh classification, acted
 as the control group. RESULTS: Interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha
 levels markedly decreased, and interleukin-10 level apparently increased in
 Group A at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. Transforming growth factor beta in
 Group A increased more remarkably at 2 weeks after treatment. T4 cells and
 Treg cells in Group A were apparently higher than those in Group B at 2 and 4
 weeks after treatment, and T8 cells and B cells were significantly lower than
 those in Group B. Aspartate aminotransferase levels in Group A were
 dramatically declining at 8 and 12 weeks after treatment. Levels of albumin,
 total bilirubin, and prothrombin time in Group A were apparently improved
 from 4 to 12 weeks after treatment. The improvements in model for end-stage
 liver disease and Child-Pugh scores in Group A were notably superior to those
 in Group B from 4 to 36 weeks after treatment. There were no remarkable
 differences in the incidence of developing liver failure throughout the
 follow-up period, but the mortality rate of Group A was lower than that of
 Group B. CONCLUSION: This therapeutic method may be an appropriate choice for
 patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.",
