    abstract "Except for the essential amino acids (AAs), much of the focus on
 adequate dietary protein intake has been on total nitrogen and caloric intake
 rather than AA composition. Recent data, however, demonstrate that ""amino-ac
id sensing"" can occur through either intracellular or extracellular
 nutrient-sensing mechanisms. In particular, members of the class 3 G-protein
 coupled receptor family, like the calcium-sensing receptor are known to
 preferentially bind specific AAs, which then modulate receptor activation by
 calcium ions and thus potentially impact bone turnover. In pursuing the
 possibility of direct nutrient effects on bone cells, we examined individual
 AA effects on osteoprogenitor/bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), a key target
 for bone anabolism. We demonstrate that BMSCs express both intracellular and
 extracellular nutrient sensing pathways and that AAs are required for BMSC
 survival. In addition, certain AA types, like members of the aromatic AAs,
 can potently stimulate increases in intracellular calcium and ERK
 phosphorylation/activation. Further, based on the in vitro data, we examined
 the effect of specific AAs on bone mass. To better evaluate the impact of
 specific AAs, we added these to a low-protein diet. Our data demonstrate that
 a low-protein diet itself is associated with a significant drop in bone
 mineral density (BMD) in the older mice, related, at least in part, to an
 increase in osteoclastic activity. This drop in BMD in mice on the
 low-protein diet is prevented by addition of AAs from the aromatic group.
 Taken together our data show that AAs function as specific and selective
 signaling molecules in bone cells.",
