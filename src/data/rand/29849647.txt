    abstract "H. pylori infection causes peptic ulcer, chronic gastritis,
 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric carcinoma. It has
 several virulence factors such as cytotoxin-associated gene A(cagA) and the
 induced by contact with epithelium antigen (iceA). We aimed to explore the
 relationship between cagA and iceA of H. pylori and gastrointestinal
 diseases. One hundred and eighteen patients who attended Gastrointestinal
 Endoscopy Unit at Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt, were included in this
 study. Two gastric biopsies were collected and evaluated by rapid urease test
 (RUT) and PCR. cagA and iceA genes were amplified by PCR. We found that 54
 patients (45.76%) were positive by both RUT and PCR. cagA and iceA genes were
 present in 57.4% and 46.29% of the studied patients, respectively. cagA was
 the most prevalent gene in gastritis (33.3%) and peptic ulcer (68.7%).
 iceA1/iceA2 positive genes were the most prevalent in gastric cancer (75%).
 iceA1 gene was present in 38.7% of cagA positive cases, but iceA2 gene was
 present in 45.2% of cagA positive cases. iceA1/iceA2 positive genes were
 present in 29% of cagA positive cases. In conclusion, cagA and iceA genes
 could be used as markers for severe gastrointestinal diseases. iceA gene was
 strongly related to cagA gene.",
