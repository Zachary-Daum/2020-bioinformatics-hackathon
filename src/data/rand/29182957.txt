    abstract "INTRODUCTION: The genetic Lauge-Hansen classification is used
 for reconstruction of the mechanism of ankle injury. In this study, we
 addressed the question of agreement between the mechanism of the fracture as
 postulated by the Lauge-Hansen classification and mechanism reported by the
 patient in rotational ankle fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiographs of
 78 patients with acute malleolar fractures were analyzed and compared with
 fracture mechanisms reported by these patients. RESULTS: The patient reported
 mechanisms were in concordance with the mechanism deducted from the X-rays in
 49% of cases. Only 17% of patients who recalled a pronation trauma actually
 had radiographs classified as pronation fractures while 76% of patients who
 recalled a supination trauma were also radiographically classified as having
 sustained supination type fractures. CONCLUSION: The Lauge-Hansen
 classification should be used with caution for determining the actual
 mechanism of injury as it was able to predict the patient reported fracture
 mechanism in less than 50% of cases. A substantial percentage of fractures
 appearing radiographically as supination type injuries may have been actually
 produced by a pronation fracture mechanism.",
