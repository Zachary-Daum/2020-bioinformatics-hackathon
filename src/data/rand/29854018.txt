    abstract "Objective: Delusions are common neuropsychiatric symptoms in
 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The aim of this study was to
 investigate the associated factors of delusions in patients with DLB. Method:
 A retrospective study of outpatients with DLB registered in a regional
 hospital's database was performed. The associated factors including cognitive
 performance, clinical features, vascular risk factors, and neuropsychiatric
 symptoms between delusional and nondelusional patients with DLB were
 compared. Results: Among 207 patients with DLB, 106 (51.2%) were delusional
 and 101 (48.8%) were not. Delusion of other persons are stealing was the most
 common symptom (35.3%). The delusional group had a significantly higher
 diagnostic rate of probable than possible DLB, higher disease severity,
 poorer cognitive performance, more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, and
 higher caregiver burden (all p < 0.05). In addition, the delusional group had
 a significantly lower frequency of diabetes compared to the nondelusional
 group (odds ratio = 0.28, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Delusion of other persons
 are stealing was the most common delusional symptom. The patients with DLB
 who presented with delusions had poorer cognitive function and more severe
 neuropsychiatric symptoms. A novel finding is that the DLB patients with
 diabetes had a lower frequency of delusions.",
