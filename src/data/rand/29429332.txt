    abstract "Chemically constructed biosensors consisting of a protein
 scaffold and an artificial small molecule have recently been recognized as
 attractive analytical tools for the specific detection and real-time
 monitoring of various biological substances or events in cells.
 Conventionally, such semisynthetic biosensors have been prepared in test
 tubes and then introduced into cells using invasive methods. With the
 impressive advances seen in bioorthogonal protein conjugation methodologies,
 however, it is now becoming feasible to directly construct semisynthetic
 biosensors in living cells, providing unprecedented tools for life-science
 research. We discuss here recent efforts regarding the in situ construction
 of protein-based semisynthetic biosensors and highlight their uses in the
 visualization and quantification of biomolecules and events in multimolecular
 and crowded cellular systems.",
