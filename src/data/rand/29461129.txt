    abstract "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Older adults are high users of healthcare
 services, mainly due to health conditions and their impact on daily
 activities, challenging the ability of health systems to provide timely and
 high-quality care. Conceivably, using disability-related variables to predict
 future healthcare utilization could contribute to reduce both older adults'
 disability and healthcare costs. This study aimed to explore the association
 between aspects of disability and older adults' primary healthcare
 utilization and hospitalization over a period of 1 year. METHODS: Older
 adults (n = 129) were assessed for self-reported disability, lower limb
 performance, pain intensity and number of painful body sites, depressive
 symptoms, and self-reported physical activity. Data on primary healthcare
 utilization and hospitalization were collected for the period of 1 year
 through registries and phone interviews. RESULTS: Regression analysis,
 adjusted for potential confounders, showed that self-reported disability and
 pain intensity were significantly associated with total primary healthcare
 utilization and together with a confounding variable (number of chronic
 conditions) explained 16% of its variance (p < 0.05). Increased physical
 activity was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of being
 admitted to hospital (95% CI for exponentiation (B) = 0.27-0.81). DISCUSSION:
 Data suggest that decreasing self-reported disability and increasing physical
 activity may decrease primary healthcare utilization and hospitalization,
 respectively.",
