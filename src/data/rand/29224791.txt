    abstract "BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is an efficacious anticancer
 agent constrained in clinical use due to its toxicity on non-targeted tissue,
 a considerable source of worry to clinicians. Because the toxicity is
 associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, the study explored
 antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of virgin coconut oil (VCO)
 supplementation in nephrotoxicity induced by MTX in rats. METHODS: Rats were
 randomized into 4 groups (n=6) as follows: Control group; MTX group injected
 with single dose of MTX (20mg/kg, ip) on day 14; VCO (5%)+MTX and VCO
 (15%)+MTX groups were pre-treated with VCO diet and injected with single dose
 of MTX (20mg/kg, ip) on day 14. After 3 days of MTX injection, serum kidney
 markers, renal activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione (GSH)
 content were determined. Lipid peroxidation level and inflammatory markers-
 interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were
 estimated in kidney. Histopathological alterations were examined for kidney
 damage. RESULTS: MTX nephrotoxicity was evidenced by markedly elevated serum
 renal markers along with significant decreases in renal GSH and activities of
 antioxidant enzymes confirmed by histopathology. Lipid peroxidation level,
 IL-6, NO and CRP markedly increased compared to control. VCO supplementation
 prior to MTX injection attenuated MTX-induced oxidative nephrotoxicity via
 prominent increases in GSH and antioxidant enzyme activities in a
 dose-dependent manner. The renal inflammatory markers and MDA depleted
 considerably compared to MTX control group. Histopathological alterations
 were mitigated to confirm the biochemical indices. CONCLUSION: VCO
 supplementation demonstrates nephroprotective activity by attenuating MTX
 oxidative nephrotoxicity via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in
 kidney. Our results suggested that VCO may benefit cancer patients on MTX
 chemotherapy against kidney injury.",
