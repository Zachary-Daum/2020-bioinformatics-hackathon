    abstract "Ambient air pollution is a well-known risk factor of various
 asthma-related outcomes, however, past research has often focused on acute
 exacerbations rather than asthma development. This study draws on a
 population-based, multigenerational panel dataset from the United States to
 assess the association of childhood asthma risk with census block-level,
 annual-average air pollution exposure measured during the prenatal and early
 postnatal periods, as well as effect modification by neighborhood poverty.
 Findings suggest that early-life exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), a
 marker of traffic-related pollution, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a
 mixture of industrial and other pollutants, are positively associated with
 subsequent childhood asthma diagnosis (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.10(-)1.41 and OR
 = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06(-)1.46, respectively, per interquartile range (IQR)
 increase in each pollutant (NO(2) IQR = 8.51 ppb and PM2.5 IQR = 4.43
 micro/m(3))). These effects are modified by early-life neighborhood poverty
 exposure, with no or weaker effects in moderate- and low- (versus high-)
 poverty areas. This work underscores the importance of a holistic,
 developmental approach to elucidating the interplay of social and
 environmental contexts that may create conditions for racial-ethnic and
 socioeconomic disparities in childhood asthma risk.",
