    abstract "We report the case of a 73-year-old right-handed female with a
 right parietal cerebral infarction and presented symptoms that were
 challenging to differentiate between alien hand sign (AHS) and sensory
 ataxia. She presented to our emergency department with chief complaints of
 abnormal involuntary movements and a feeling of foreignness on her left upper
 limb. The first neurological examination revealed left spatial neglect,
 left-side sensory impairment that included superficial and deep sensations,
 left limb-kinetic apraxia, and left limb ataxia. Furthermore, her symptoms
 and complaints had characteristics of AHS that includes a sensation that her
 left upper limb dose not belong to herself and an abnormal behavior of left
 hand that is contrary to her own intent. Brain MRI revealed an acute cerebral
 infarction confined to the right postcentral gyrus. This case highlights that
 sensory ataxia due to the disturbance of deep sensation might present
 symptoms similar to AHS. Previous studies suggested the involvement of the
 disturbance of somatosensory pathway in posterior-variant AHS. Therefore, a
 precise distinction between AHS and sensory ataxia, especially in
 posterior-variant AHS, is imperative to avoid confusion regarding the term 
""alien hand sign.""",
