    abstract "OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to determine effects of
 different curing salts on the quality of salamis and to assess feasibility of
 using NaCl-alternative salts. METHODS: Various types of curing salts (KCl or
 MgCl2) as well as NaCl (sun-dried or refined) were incorporated for
 processing of salamis. The proximate composition, fatty acids,
 nucleotide-related compounds, and free amino acids of the salamis were
 analyzed during 40 days of ripening. RESULTS: The substitution of NaCl by KCl
 caused higher fat and ash content, but lower moisture content of the salami
 after 20 days of ripening (p<0.05). Compared with the sun-dried NaCl, use of
 KCl in salami also led to greater inosine 5'-monophosphate whereas refined
 NaCl had more inosine (p<0.05). KCl-added salami also had a higher C12:0,
 C17:1, and C20:0 than other types of salami (p<0.05). MgCl2-added salami had
 higher content of free amino acids compared to the other salamis (p<0.05).
 CONCLUSION: Alternative curing salts such as KCl and MgCl2 could substitute
 NaCl in consideration of quality factor of a fermented meat product.
 Especially replacement of NaCl with KCl will be a suitable strategy for
 developing relatively low sodium salami products without compromising product
 quality.",
