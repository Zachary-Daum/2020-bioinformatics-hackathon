    abstract "Motivation: Accumulating evidences indicate that long non-coding
 RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in various biological processes. Mutations
 and dysregulations of lncRNAs are implicated in miscellaneous human diseases.
 Predicting lncRNA-disease associations is beneficial to disease diagnosis as
 well as treatment. Although many computational methods have been developed,
 precisely identifying lncRNA-disease associations, especially for novel
 lncRNAs, remains challenging. Results: In this study, we propose a method
 (named SIMCLDA) for predicting potential lncRNA-disease associations based on
 inductive matrix completion. We compute Gaussian interaction profile kernel
 of lncRNAs from known lncRNA-disease interactions and functional similarity
 of diseases based on disease-gene and gene-gene onotology associations. Then,
 we extract primary feature vectors from Gaussian interaction profile kernel
 of lncRNAs and functional similarity of diseases by principal component
 analysis, respectively. For a new lncRNA, we calculate the interaction
 profile according to the interaction profiles of its neighbors. At last, we
 complete the association matrix based on the inductive matrix completion
 framework using the primary feature vectors from the constructed feature
 matrices. Computational results show that SIMCLDA can effectively predict
 lncRNA-disease associations with higher accuracy compared with previous
 methods. Furthermore, case studies show that SIMCLDA can effectively predict
 candidate lncRNAs for renal cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer.
