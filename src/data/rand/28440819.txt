    abstract "Carbon dot (CD)-based multifunctional delivery systems have
 shown great potential in both drug/gene delivery and bio-imaging. In this
 work, we present a strategy to simply construct amphiphilic CDs (ACDs) by
 conjugating hydrophobic alkyl epoxide to the surface amino groups of PEI
 600-derived CDs. ACDs could well dissolve in water or organic solvents and
 emit bright fluorescence both in solutions and cells. (1)HNMR also suggested
 that ACDs may form micelle-like structures in water, and their CMC could be
 determined. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression and flow
 cytometry experiments showed that ACDs have higher transfection efficiency
 than Lipofectamine 2000 in A549 cells. Besides DNA, ACDs could also
 effectively transfect Sur siRNA toward A549 cells and cause early cell
 apoptosis. The 3D multicellular spheroids further confirmed their high
 potential for delivering therapeutic genes into the tumor tissue. On the
 other hand, ACDs also exhibited good drug loading ability. CLSM experiment
 results showed that DOX could be effectively internalized by the cell and
 slowly released from the drug/ACD complex. These results suggest that ACDs
 may not only serve as versatile delivery vectors with potential for
 applications in clinical cancer treatment, but also offer an inspiration for
 the discovery of CD-based gene/drug delivery systems.",
