    abstract "The current research examined whether carriers of the short
 5-HTTLPR allele (in SLC6A4), who have been shown to selectively attend to
 negative information, exhibit a bias towards negative self-referent
 processing. The self-referent encoding task (SRET) was used to measure
 self-referential processing of positive and negative adjectives. Ratcliff's
 diffusion model isolated and extracted decision-making components from SRET
 responses and reaction times. Across the initial (N = 183) and replication (N
 = 137) studies, results indicated that short 5-HTTLPR allele carriers more
 easily categorized negative adjectives as self-referential (i.e., higher
 drift rate). Further, drift rate was associated with recall of negative
 self-referential stimuli. Findings across both studies provide further
 evidence that genetic variation may contribute to the etiology of negatively
 biased processing of self-referent information. Large scale studies examining
 the genetic contributions to negative self-referent processing may be
 warranted.",
