    abstract "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to quantify the
 interactions of the 3 vocalization subsystems of respiration, phonation, and
 resonance before, during, and after a perturbation to the larynx (temporarily
 induced unilateral vocal fold paralysis) in 10 vocally healthy participants.
 Using dynamic systems theory as a guide, we hypothesized that data groupings
 would emerge revealing context-dependent patterns in the relationships of
 variables representing the 3 vocalization subsystems. We also hypothesized
 that group data would mask important individual variability important to
 understanding the relationships among the vocalization subsystems. Method: A
 perturbation paradigm was used to obtain respiratory kinematic, aerodynamic,
 and acoustic formant measures from 10 healthy participants (8 women, 2 men)
 with normal voices. Group and individual data were analyzed to provide a
 multilevel analysis of the data. A 3-dimensional state space model was
 constructed to demonstrate the interactive relationships among the 3
 subsystems before, during, and after perturbation. Results: During
 perturbation, group data revealed that lung volume initiations and
 terminations were lower, with longer respiratory excursions; airflow rates
 increased while subglottic pressures were maintained. Acoustic formant
 measures indicated that the spacing between the upper formants decreased
 (F3-F5), whereas the spacing between F1 and F2 increased. State space
 modeling revealed the changing directionality and interactions among the 3
 subsystems. Conclusions: Group data alone masked important variability
 necessary to understand the unique relationships among the 3 subsystems.
 Multilevel analysis permitted a richer understanding of the individual
 differences in phonatory regulation and permitted subgroup analysis. Dynamic
 systems theory may be a useful heuristic to model the interactive
 relationships among vocalization subsystems. Supplemental Material:
