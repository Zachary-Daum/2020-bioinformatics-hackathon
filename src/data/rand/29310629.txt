    abstract "BACKGROUND: Multiple external environmental exposures related to
 residential location and urban form including, air pollutants, noise,
 greenness, and walkability have been linked to health impacts or benefits.
 The Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE) was
 established to facilitate the linkage of extensive geospatial exposure data
 to existing Canadian cohorts and administrative health data holdings. We
 hypothesize that this linkage will enable investigators to test a variety of
 their own hypotheses related to the interdependent associations of built
 environment features with diverse health outcomes encompassed by the cohorts
 and administrative data. METHODS: We developed a protocol for compiling
 measures of built environment features that quantify exposure; vary spatially
 on the urban and suburban scale; and can be modified through changes in
 policy or individual behaviour to benefit health. These measures fall into
 six domains: air quality, noise, greenness, weather/climate, and
 transportation and neighbourhood factors; and will be indexed to six-digit
 postal codes to facilitate merging with health databases. Initial efforts
 focus on existing data and include estimates of air pollutants, greenness,
 temperature extremes, and neighbourhood walkability and socioeconomic
 characteristics. Key gaps will be addressed for noise exposure, with a new
 national model being developed, and for transportation-related exposures,
 with detailed estimates of truck volumes and diesel emissions now underway in
 selected cities. Improvements to existing exposure estimates are planned,
 primarily by increasing temporal and/or spatial resolution given new
 satellite-based sensors and more detailed national air quality modelling.
 Novel metrics are also planned for walkability and food environments, green
 space access and function and life-long climate-related exposures based on
 local climate zones. Critical challenges exist, for example, the quantity and
 quality of input data to many of the models and metrics has changed over
 time, making it difficult to develop and validate historical exposures.
 DISCUSSION: CANUE represents a unique effort to coordinate and leverage
 substantial research investments and will enable a more focused effort on
 filling gaps in exposure information, improving the range of exposures
 quantified, their precision and mechanistic relevance to health.
 Epidemiological studies may be better able to explore the common theme of
 urban form and health in an integrated manner, ultimately contributing new
 knowledge informing policies that enhance healthy urban living.",
