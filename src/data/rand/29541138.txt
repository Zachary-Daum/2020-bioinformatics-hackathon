    abstract "Background: Childhood overweight is a crucial public health
 concern. Recognizing its associated factors can facilitate the establishment
 of effective prevention strategies. The aim of the present study was to
 examine the prevalence of overweight in Hong Kong Chinese children and
 explore its influential factors in relation to family, early-life development
 and behavior-related issues. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted
 in 894 primary school students aged 9-12 years (50.4% boys). Self-reported
 information on family background (parental body weight, education, employment
 status, household income, living space, and bedroom situation), early-life
 developmental variables (birth weight, gestational age and feeding pattern),
 and children's lifestyle factors (sleep, various eating behaviors and
 physical activity) were collected with a questionnaire. A logistic regression
 was performed to test the associations. Results: The overweight prevalence in
 Hong Kong children was 19.9%. Compared to the girls, the boys were more
 overweight (23.5% vs. 16.3%). Overweight was linked to paternal overweight,
 maternal overweight, lower maternal education, less monthly household income,
 and shorter sleep duration. Compared to the breast-fed children, those who
 were not breast-fed were more likely to become overweight, with marginal
 significance. Conclusion: The present study revealed a high prevalence of
 overweight in Hong Kong pediatric population and demonstrated the family
 resemblance in weight status. Further interventions and promotions should
 involve parents and consider the family as a unit to tackle childhood
 overweight.",
