    abstract "Impactful dietary RNA delivery requires improving uptake and
 enhancing digestive stability. In mouse feeding regimes, we have demonstrated
 that a plant-based ribosomal RNA (rRNA), MIR2911, is more bioavailable than
 synthetic MIR2911 or canonical microRNAs (miRNAs). Here mutagenesis was used
 to discern if MIR2911 has a distinctive sequence that aids stability and
 uptake. Various mutations had modest impacts while one scrambled sequence
 displayed significantly enhanced digestive stability, serum stability, and
 bioavailability. To assess if small RNA (sRNA) bioavailability in mice could
 be improved by increasing gut permeability, various diets, genetic
 backgrounds and pharmacological methods were surveyed. An intraperitoneal
 injection of anti-CD3 antibody enhanced gut permeability which correlated
 with improved uptake of the digestively stable scrambled MIR2911 variant.
 However, the bioavailability of canonical miRNAs was not enhanced. Similarly,
 interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient mice and mice treated with aspirin displayed
 enhanced gut permeability that did not enhance uptake of most plant-based
 sRNAs. This work supports a model where dietary RNAs are vulnerable to
 digestion and altering gut permeability alone will not impact apparent
 bioavailability. We suggest that some dietary sRNA may be more digestively
 stable and methods to broadly increase sRNA uptake requires delivery vehicles
 to optimize gut and serum stability in the consumer.",
