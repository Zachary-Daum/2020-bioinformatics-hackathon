    abstract "Metabolic rate reflects an organism's capacity for growth,
 maintenance and reproduction, and is likely to be a target of selection.
 Physiologists have long sought to understand the causes and consequences of
 within-individual to among-species variation in metabolic rates - how
 metabolic rates relate to performance and how they should evolve.
 Traditionally, this has been viewed from a mechanistic perspective, relying
 primarily on hypothesis-driven approaches. A more agnostic, but ultimately
 more powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of phenotypic variation is
 through use of the breeder's equation, because variation in metabolic rate is
 likely to be a consequence of underlying microevolutionary processes. Here we
 show that metabolic rates are often significantly heritable, and are
 therefore free to evolve under selection. We note, however, that 'metabolic
 rate' is not a single trait: in addition to the obvious differences between
 metabolic levels (e.g. basal, resting, free-living, maximal), metabolic rate
 changes through ontogeny and in response to a range of extrinsic factors, and
 is therefore subject to multivariate constraint and selection. We emphasize
 three key advantages of studying metabolic rate within a quantitative
 genetics framework: its formalism, and its predictive and comparative power.
 We make several recommendations when applying a quantitative genetics
 framework: (i) measuring selection based on actual fitness, rather than
 proxies for fitness; (ii) considering the genetic covariances between
 metabolic rates throughout ontogeny; and (iii) estimating genetic covariances
 between metabolic rates and other traits. A quantitative genetics framework
 provides the means for quantifying the evolutionary potential of metabolic
 rate and why variance in metabolic rates within populations might be
 maintained.",
