    abstract "AIM: To compare the overall survival (OS) and liver
 cancer-specific survival of advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
 patients who received transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with those who
 received nonoperative/interventional treatment (NOT). MATERIALS & METHODS: A
 total of 12,520 HCC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
 Results database were categorized by treatment with either radioembolization
 or NOT. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression were conducted. RESULTS:
 The TARE group had both a significantly longer median overall survival than
 the NOT group (TARE = 9 months; NOT = 2 months; p < 0.0001) and a
 significantly higher probability of liver cancer-specific survival (hazard
 ratio = 0.474). CONCLUSION: TARE appears to provide a significant survival
 advantage over the NOT population in advanced HCC patients.",
