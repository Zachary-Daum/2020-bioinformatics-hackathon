    abstract "Mechanisms of toxicity and cellular transport of anticancer
 metallodrugs, including platinum-based agents, have not yet been fully
 elucidated. Here, we studied the toxic effects and accumulation mechanisms of
 cisplatin in healthy rat kidneys ex vivo, using the Precision Cut Tissue
 Slices (PCTS) method. In addition, for the first time, we investigated the
 nephrotoxic effects of an experimental anticancer cyclometallated complex
 [Au(py(b)-H)(PTA)Cl]PF6 (PTA = 1,3,5-triazaphosphaadamantane). The viability
 of the kidney slices after metallodrug treatment was evaluated by ATP content
 determination and histomorphology analysis. A concentration dependent
 decrease in viability of PCKS was observed after exposure to cisplatin or the
 Au(iii) complex, which correlated with the increase in slice content of Pt
 and Au, respectively. Metal accumulation in kidney slices was analysed by
 ICP-MS. The involvement of OCTs and MATE transporters in the accumulation of
 both metal compounds in kidneys was evaluated co-incubating the tissues with
 cimitedine, inhibitor of OCT and MATE. Studies of mRNA expression of the
 markers KIM-1, villin, p53 and Bax showed that cisplatin damages proximal
 tubules, whereas the Au(iii) complex preferentially affects the distal
 tubules. However, no effect of cimetidine on the toxicity or accumulation of
 cisplatin and the Au(iii) complex was observed. The effect of temperature on
 metallodrug accumulation in kidneys suggests the involvement of a
 carrier-mediated uptake process, other than OCT2, for cisplatin; while
 carrier-mediated excretion was suggested in the cases of the Au(iii) complex.",
