    abstract "The measurement of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)
 proviral DNA levels by using polymerase chain reaction has been beneficial
 for confirming HTLV-1 infection during pregnancy. However, the influence of
 pregnancy on HTLV-1 infection and proviral DNA levels among pregnant women
 with HTLV-1 has not been clarified. We prospectively gathered blood samples
 from 36 pregnant women in whom HTLV-1 carriage was previously diagnosed and
 sequentially measured their proviral DNA levels. The HTLV-1 proviral DNA
 levels remained at a plateau during pregnancy but were elevated after
 delivery. Moreover, flow cytometry and serological analyses revealed that the
 regulatory T-cell population and soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels were
 similarly elevated after birth in comparison with those in control pregnant
 women. This study is the first to provide data on sequential changes in
 HTLV-1 proviral DNA levels during and after pregnancy. These findings will
 guide the establishment of a better program to prevent mother-to-child
 transmission of HTLV-1.",
