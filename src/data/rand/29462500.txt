    abstract "BACKGROUND: Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) - heaving bleeding
 within the first 24 hours after giving birth - is one of the main causes of
 death of women after childbirth. Antifibrinolytics, primarily tranexamic acid
 (TXA), have been shown to reduce bleeding in surgery and safely reduces
 mortality in trauma patients with bleeding without increasing the risk of
 adverse events.An earlier Cochrane review on treatments for primary PPH
 covered all the various available treatments - that review has now been split
 by types of treatment. This new review concentrates only on the use of
 antifibrinolytic drugs for treating primary PPH. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
 effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic drugs for treating primary PPH.
 SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials
 Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry
 Platform (ICTRP) (28 May 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
 SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including
 cluster-randomised trials of antifibrinolytic drugs (aprotinin, TXA,
 epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and aminomethylbenzoic acid, administered by
 whatever route) for primary PPH in women.Participants in the trials were
 women after birth following a pregnancy of at least 24 weeks' gestation with
 a diagnosis of PPH, regardless of mode of birth (vaginal or caesarean
 section) or other aspects of third stage management.We have not included
 quasi-randomised trials, or cross-over studies. Studies reported as abstracts
 have not been included if there was insufficient information to allow
 assessment of risk of bias.In this review we only identified studies looking
 at TXA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently
 extracted data from each study using an agreed form. We entered data into
 Review Manager software and checked for accuracy.For key review outcomes, we
 rated the quality of the evidence as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low'
 according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials (20,412 women)
 met our inclusion criteria. Two trials (20,212 women) compared intravenous
 (IV) TXA with placebo or standard care and were conducted in acute hospital
 settings (labour ward, emergency department) (in high-, middle- and
 low-income countries).One other trial (involving 200 women) was conducted in
 Iran and compared IV TXA with rectal misoprostol, but did not report on any
 of this review's primary or GRADE outcomes. There were no trials that
 assessed EACA, aprotinin or aminomethylbenzoic acid.Standard care plus IV TXA
 for the treatment of primary PPH compared with placebo or standard care
 aloneTwo trials (20,212 women) assessed the effect of TXA for the treatment
 of primary PPH compared with placebo or standard care alone. The larger of
 these (The WOMAN trial) contributed over 99% of the data and was assessed as
 being at low risk of bias. The quality of the evidence varied for different
 outcomes, Overall, evidence was mainly graded as moderate to high quality.The
 data show that IV TXA reduces the risk of maternal death due to bleeding
 (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.00; two trials,
 20,172 women; quality of evidence: moderate). The quality of evidence was
 rated as moderate due to imprecision of effect estimate. The effect was more
 evident in women given treatment between one and three hours after giving
 birth with no apparent reduction when given after three hours (< one hour =
 RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.16; one to three hours = RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to
 0.88; > three hours = RR 1.07, 95% 0.76 to 1.51; test for subgroup
 differences: Chi(2) = 4.90, df = 2 (P = 0.09), I(2) = 59.2%). There was no
 heterogeneity in the effect by mode of birth (test for subgroup differences:
 Chi(2) = 0.01, df = 1 (P = 0.91), I(2) = 0%). There were fewer deaths from
 all causes in women receiving TXA, although the 95% CI for the effect
 estimate crosses the line of no effect (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; two
 trials, 20,172 women, quality of evidence: moderate). Results from one trial
 with 151 women suggest that blood loss of >/= 500 mL after randomisation may
 be reduced (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.93; one trial, 151 women; quality of
 evidence: low). TXA did not reduce the risk of serious maternal morbidity (RR
 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; one trial, 20,015 women; quality of evidence:
 high), hysterectomy to control bleeding (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12; one
 trial, 20,017 women; quality of evidence: high) receipt of blood transfusion
 (any) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03; two trials, 20,167 women; quality of
 evidence: moderate) or maternal vascular occlusive events (any), although
 results were imprecise for this latter outcome (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.43;
 one trial, 20,018 women; quality of evidence: moderate). There was an
 increase in the use of brace sutures in the TXA group (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01,
 1.41) and a reduction in the need for laparotomy for bleeding (RR 0.64, 95%
 CI 0.49, 0.85). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: TXA when administered intravenously
 reduces mortality due to bleeding in women with primary PPH, irrespective of
 mode of birth, and without increasing the risk of thromboembolic events.
 Taken together with the reliable evidence of the effect of TXA in trauma
 patients, the evidence suggests that TXA is effective if given as early as
 possible.Facilities for IV administration may not be available in
 non-hospital settings therefore, alternative routes to IV administration need
 to be investigated.",
