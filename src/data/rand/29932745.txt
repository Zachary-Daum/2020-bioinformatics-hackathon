    abstract "The acceptance and popularity of personality assessments in
 organizational contexts has grown enormously over the last 40 years. Although
 these are used across many applications, such as executive coaching, team
 building, and hiring and promotion decisions, the focus of most published
 research on the use of personality assessments at work is biased toward
 assessment for employee selection. Reviews have therefore tended to use
 criteria that are appropriate for selection, neglecting the additional and
 different criteria that are important in relation to employee development. An
 illustration of the often-discussed scientist-practitioner divide is that the
 Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is the most widely known and used personality
 assessment in organizations, despite harsh criticism by the academic
 community. This article reviews this debate, and draws implications for the
 appropriate choice of personality assessments for use in individual and team
 development, and a new direction for scientific research.",
