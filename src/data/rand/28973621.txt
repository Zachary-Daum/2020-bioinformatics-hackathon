    abstract "Importance: Chronic respiratory diseases are an important cause
 of death and disability in the United States. Objective: To estimate
 age-standardized mortality rates by county from chronic respiratory diseases.
 Design, Setting, and Participants: Validated small area estimation models
 were applied to deidentified death records from the National Center for
 Health Statistics and population counts from the US Census Bureau, National
 Center for Health Statistics, and Human Mortality Database to estimate
 county-level mortality rates from 1980 to 2014 for chronic respiratory
 diseases. Exposure: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures:
 Age-standardized mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cause. Results: A
 total of 4616711 deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases were recorded in
 the United States from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2014.
 Nationally, the mortality rate from chronic respiratory diseases increased
 from 40.8 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 39.8-41.8) deaths per 100000
 population in 1980 to a peak of 55.4 (95% UI, 54.1-56.5) deaths per 100000
 population in 2002 and then declined to 52.9 (95% UI, 51.6-54.4) deaths per
 100000 population in 2014. This overall 29.7% (95% UI, 25.5%-33.8%) increase
 in chronic respiratory disease mortality from 1980 to 2014 reflected
 increases in the mortality rate from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
 (by 30.8% [95% UI, 25.2%-39.0%], from 34.5 [95% UI, 33.0-35.5] to 45.1 [95%
 UI, 43.7-46.9] deaths per 100000 population), interstitial lung disease and
 pulmonary sarcoidosis (by 100.5% [95% UI, 5.8%-155.2%], from 2.7 [95% UI,
 2.3-4.2] to 5.5 [95% UI, 3.5-6.1] deaths per 100000 population), and all
 other chronic respiratory diseases (by 42.3% [95% UI, 32.4%-63.8%], from 0.51
 [95% UI, 0.48-0.54] to 0.73 [95% UI, 0.69-0.78] deaths per 100000
 population). There were substantial differences in mortality rates and
 changes in mortality rates over time among counties, and geographic patterns
 differed by cause. Counties with the highest mortality rates were found
 primarily in central Appalachia for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
 pneumoconiosis; widely dispersed throughout the Southwest, northern Great
 Plains, New England, and South Atlantic for interstitial lung disease; along
 the southern half of the Mississippi River and in Georgia and South Carolina
 for asthma; and in southern states from Mississippi to South Carolina for
 other chronic respiratory diseases. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite recent
 declines in mortality from chronic respiratory diseases, mortality rates in
 2014 remained significantly higher than in 1980. Between 1980 and 2014, there
 were important differences in mortality rates and changes in mortality by
 county, sex, and particular chronic respiratory disease type. These estimates
 may be helpful for informing efforts to improve prevention, diagnosis, and
 treatment.",
