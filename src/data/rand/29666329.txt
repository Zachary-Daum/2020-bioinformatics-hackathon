    abstract "To understand the variation in genomic composition and its
 effect on codon usage, we performed the comparative analysis of codon usage
 and nucleotide usage in the genes of three dicots, Glycine max, Arabidopsis
 thaliana and Medicago truncatula. The dicot genes were found to be A/T rich
 and have predominantly A-ending and/or T-ending codons. GC3s directly mimic
 theusage pattern of global GC content. Relative synonymous codon usage
 analysis suggests that the high usage frequency of A/T over G/C
 mononucleotide containing codons in AT-rich dicot genome is due to
 compositional constraint as a factor of codon usage bias. Odds ratio analysis
 identified the dinucleotides TpG, TpC, GpA, CpA and CpT as over-represented,
 where, CpG and TpA as under-represented dinucleotides. The results of
 (NcExp-NcObs)/NcExp plot suggests that selection pressure other than mutation
 played a significant role in influencing the pattern of codon usage in these
 dicots. PR2 analysis revealed the significant role of selection pressure on
 codon usage. Analysis of varience on codon usage at start and stop site
 showed variation in codon selection in these sites. This study provides
 evidence that the dicot genes were subjected to compositional selection
 pressure.",
