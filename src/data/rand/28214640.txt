    abstract "BACKGROUND: Cavernous hemangiomas account for 5%-13% of central
 nervous system vascular lesions. They are usually found intra-axially but
 rarely involve extra-axial structures, most commonly the middle cranial
 fossa. A cavernous hemangioma manifesting as a clinoid meningioma is
 extremely rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old man presented with an
 asymptomatic intracranial mass found incidentally after a motor vehicle
 accident. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-defined
 dural-based lesion arising from the right anterior clinoid process that was
 nearly homogeneously enhancing. The radiologic diagnosis was meningioma. The
 mass was resected via a right pterional craniotomy with microsurgical
 technique. Complete resection of the mass was performed with no complications
 and no significant bleeding. Contrasting with the radiologic and gross tumor
 appearance, histopathologic examination revealed dilated vascular spaces,
 sclerotic vessels without intervening neural tissue, and intravascular
 thrombi suggesting slow blood flow-all consistent with cavernous hemangioma.
 CONCLUSIONS: Anterior clinoid dural-based cavernous hemangiomas are extremely
 rare. Although preoperative diagnosis is difficult using imaging, this
 etiology should be considered for any dural-based middle fossa lesion, owing
 to the tendency for these lesions to bleed heavily during resection in some
 instances.",
