    abstract "Myelination calls for a remarkable surge in cell metabolism to
 facilitate lipid and membrane production. Endogenous fatty acid (FA)
 synthesis represents a potentially critical process in myelinating glia.
 Using genetically modified mice, we show that Schwann cell (SC) intrinsic
 activity of the enzyme essential for de novo FA synthesis, fatty acid
 synthase (FASN), is crucial for precise lipid composition of peripheral
 nerves and fundamental for the correct onset of myelination and proper myelin
 growth. Upon FASN depletion in SCs, epineurial adipocytes undergo lipolysis,
 suggestive of a compensatory role. Mechanistically, we found that a lack of
 FASN in SCs leads to an impairment of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
 receptor (PPAR) gamma-regulated transcriptional program. In agreement,
 defects in myelination of FASN-deficient SCs could be ameliorated by
 treatment with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone ex vivo and in vivo. Our
 results reveal that FASN-driven de novo FA synthesis in SCs is mandatory for
 myelination and identify lipogenic activation of the PPARgamma
 transcriptional network as a putative downstream functional mediator.",
