    abstract "Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)
 is a major risk factor for cervical cancer. Greater than 90% of these cancers
 originate in the cervical transformation zone (TZ), a narrow region of
 metaplastic squamous epithelium that develops at the squamocolumnar junction
 between the ectocervix and endocervix. It is unclear why the TZ has high
 susceptibility to malignant transformation and few studies have specifically
 examined cells from this region. We hypothesized that cells cultured from TZ
 are more susceptible to cellular immortalization, an alteration that
 contributes to malignant development. We cultured primary epithelial cells
 from each region of human cervix (ectocervix, endocervix and TZ) and measured
 susceptibility to immortalization after transfection with the complete HPV-16
 genome or infection of HPV16 E6/E7 retroviruses. Cells cultured from each
 cervical region expressed keratin markers (keratin 14 and 18) that confirmed
 their region of origin. In contrast to our prediction, cells from TZ were
 equally susceptible to immortalization as cells from ectocervix or
 endocervix. Thus, increased susceptibility of the TZ to cervical
 carcinogenesis is not due to increased frequency of immortalization by
 HPV-16. We developed a series of HPV16-immortalized cell lines from
 ectocervix, endocervix and TZ that will enable comparisons of how these cells
 respond to factors that promote cervical carcinogenesis.",
