    abstract "In a recent study [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2014, 53, 9957-9960] a
 new concept of chiral separation has been suggested, which is based on
 functionalized, nanoporous sheets of graphene. In this follow-up article we
 discuss the underlying principle in greater detail and make suggestions for
 suitable pore functionalizations with respect to a selection of chiral
 prototype molecules. Considering drug molecules as future targets for a
 chiral separation via membranes, the necessary pore sizes represent a big
 challenge for standard methods of computational chemistry. Therefore, we test
 two common force fields (GAFF, CGenFF) as well as a semiempirical
 tight-binding approach recently developed by the Grimme group (GFN-xTB)
 against the computationally much more expensive density functional theory. We
 identify the GFN-xTB method as the most suitable approach for future
 simulations of functionalized pores for the given purpose, as it is able to
 produce reaction pathways in very good agreement with density functional
 theory, even in cases where force fields tend to an extreme overestimation of
 barrier heights.",
