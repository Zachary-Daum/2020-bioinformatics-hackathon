    abstract "BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine whether higher neutrophil
 counts (NC) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were independently
 predictive of worse in-hospital outcome in patients after acute ischemic
 stroke (IS). METHODS: A retrospective observational study with prospective
 manner of IS registration. Between April 2012 and August 2014, a total number
 of 1731 patients with post-IS were consecutively enrolled in the study. Blood
 samples were drawn upon admission. Primary endpoint was in-hospital
 mortality. Secondary endpoint was severe stroke (>/=16 NIHSS). RESULTS: The
 NC progressively increased from mild (NIHSS </= 5) to moderate (NIHSS >/= 6 <
 16) and severe (NIHSS >/= 16) stroke (p = 0.006). NLR was independently
 associated with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.002). Multiple stepwise linear
 regression analysis showed that NC (p = 0.001) and NLR (p = 0.002) were
 independently predictive of higher NIHSS. Multiple stepwise logistic
 regression analysis showed that NC was independently associated with severe
 stroke (p < 0.0001). The best discriminating factor for in-hospital mortality
 with respect to NLR was >/=3.20 (sensitivity 62.7%, specificity 60.3%,
 likelihood ratio: 12.2). Patients with NLR >/=3.20 had a 2.55-fold increased
 risk for in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.49-4.37) compared to patients with NLR
 <3.20. The best discriminating factor for severe stroke (>/=16 NIHSS) with
 respect to NC was >/=74% (sensitivity 47.1%, specificity 74.0%, likelihood
 ratio: 29.0). Patients with NC >74% had a 2.54-fold increased risk of severe
 stroke (OR = 1.82-3.54) compared to patients with NC <74%. CONCLUSION: NLR
 was independently associated with in-hospital mortality and higher NC was
 independently predictive of severe stroke.",
