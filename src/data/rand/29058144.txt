    abstract "BACKGROUND: Approximately 5% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors
 (GISTs) originate in the rectum, and historically, radical resection was
 commonly performed. Little is known about the outcome for rectal GIST in the
 era of imatinib. METHODS: Using a prospectively maintained database, this
 study retrospectively analyzed 47 localized primary rectal GISTs treated at
 our center from 1982 to 2016, stratified by when imatinib became available in
 2000. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and
 recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
 RESULTS: Rectal GISTs represented 7.1% of 663 primary GISTs. The findings
 showed 17 patients in the pre-imatinib era and 30 patients in the imatinib
 era. The two groups had similar follow-up evaluation, age, gender, Miettinen
 risk, and distance to the anal verge. In the imatinib era, tumors were
 smaller at diagnosis (median 4 vs. 5 cm; p = 0.029), and 24 of the 30
 patients received perioperative imatinib. In the high-risk patients, organ
 preservation and negative margins were more common among the 13 patients
 treated with neoadjuvant imatinib than among the 21 patients treated directly
 with surgery. High-risk patients who received perioperative imatinib (n = 15)
 had greater (or nearly significantly greater) 5-year OS, DSS, local RFS, and
 distant RFS than those who did not (n = 19) (91, 100, 100, and 71% vs. 47,
 65, 74, and 41%; p = 0.049, 0.052, 0.077, 0.051, respectively). In the
 imatinib era, no patient has had a local recurrence or death due to GIST.
 CONCLUSIONS: The use of imatinib is associated with organ preservation and
 improved oncologic outcome for patients with rectal GIST.",
