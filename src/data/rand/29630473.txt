    abstract "We investigated the demographic correlates associated with
 suicide bereavement among a representative sample of U.S. adults from the
 2016 General Social Survey. A secondary aim of this study was to use this
 representative data platform to cross-check official data findings of U.S.
 completed suicides. Questions on suicide bereavement were administered to
 1,432 GSS 2016 respondents and these were cross-tabulated with various
 demographic and social activity variables included in this omnibus survey to
 investigate whether suicide bereaved respondents shared any distinctive
 demographic characteristics. Findings showed that friends of the suicide
 deceased person outnumbered the deceased's first degree relatives by at least
 2 to 1. We also observed older, White, Non-Hispanic, and native born women
 were over-represented among the suicide bereaved. The suicide bereaved were
 also less likely to live in the Pacific region, and to live in the nation's
 largest cities, and were more likely to come from homes where a gun was owned
 by someone in the household. More of the suicide bereaved reported themselves
 to be in poorer physical health and bereaved women were more likely to be
 Facebook subscribers. These findings are consistent with other data on U.S.
 suicide patterns and the greater likelihood of firearms being utilized in
 suicide deaths. These revealed demographic correlates of suicide offer
 valuable information to helping agencies seeking to reach potential clients
 among the suicide bereaved.",
