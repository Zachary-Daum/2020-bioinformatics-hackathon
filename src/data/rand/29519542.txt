    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To establish baseline trends in fecal calprotectin, a
 protein excreted into the stool when there is neutrophilic inflammation in
 the bowel, in infants at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). STUDY
 DESIGN: We performed a prospective observational cohort study in infants with
 a birth weight of <1500 g without existing bowel disease at a level IV
 neonatal intensive care unit from October 2015 to September 2016. Stools were
 collected once daily for 30 days or until 32 weeks postmenstrual age and
 processed using the Fecal Calprotectin High Range Quantitative Quantum Blue
 assay. RESULTS: In 64 preterm infants, during the first week after birth, 62%
 of infants had an initial stool sample with high baseline calprotectin levels
 (>/=200 microg/g). In assessment of maternal and neonatal risk factors,
 maternal etiology for preterm birth (ie, eclamplsia or preeclampsia) was the
 only significant factor associated with high baseline calprotectin level. Two
 patients in the cohort developed NEC. Calprotectin levels for the entire
 cohort fluctuated during the observed period but generally increased in the
 third and fourth weeks after birth. CONCLUSIONS: At-risk infants had highly
 variable fecal calprotectin levels, with maternal causes for preterm birth
 associated with higher baseline levels. More longitudinal data in infants
 with NEC are necessary to determine whether acute rises in fecal calprotectin
 levels prior to clinical diagnosis can be confirmed as a diagnostic or
 prognostic biomarker.",
