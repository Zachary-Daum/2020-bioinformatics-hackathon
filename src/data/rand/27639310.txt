    abstract "AIM: Adiponectin is the most abundant adipokine and may play a
 key role in the interplay between obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance
 and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Thus, this large population-based cohort
 investigated whether adiponectin at baseline and/or a decrease in adiponectin
 during follow-up is associated prospectively with the risk of incident MetS.
 METHODS: Using a prospective study design, the development of MetS was
 examined in 1134 healthy participants from the community. Plasma adiponectin
 was measured at study entry and again after a median follow-up of 9.4 years
 (IQR: 9.2-9.7). During follow-up, 187 participants developed MetS, and 439
 presented with at least two components of MetS. RESULTS: During follow-up,
 adiponectin decreased in participants who developed MetS, whereas adiponectin
 was increased in those who did not develop MetS (P<0.001). Those with low
 adiponectin levels (quartile 1) at baseline had an increased risk of
 developing MetS (OR: 2.92, 2.08-6.97; P<0.001) compared with those with high
 levels (quartile 4). After adjusting for confounding variables, low
 adiponectin levels at baseline remained independently associated with MetS
 (OR: 2.24, 1.11-4.52; P=0.017). Similarly, participants with a decrease in
 adiponectin during follow-up also had an increased risk of MetS (OR: 2.96,
 2.09-4.18; P<0.001). This association persisted after multivariable
 adjustments, including for baseline adiponectin (OR: 4.37, 2.77-6.97;
 P<0.001). Finally, adiponectin levels at follow-up were inversely associated
 with an increase in the number of components of MetS (P<0.001); geometric
 mean adiponectin levels were 9.5mg/L (95% CI: 9.0-10.0) for participants with
 no components vs 7.0mg/L (95% CI: 6.3-7.9) for those with four to five
 components. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low plasma adiponectin levels at
 baseline and decreasing adiponectin levels during follow-up are both
 associated with an increased risk of MetS.",
