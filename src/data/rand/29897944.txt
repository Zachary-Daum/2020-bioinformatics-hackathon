    abstract "Paclitaxel is a powerful chemotherapeutic drug, used for the
 treatment of many cancer types, including esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC).
 Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation process maintaining cellular
 homeostasis. Defective autophagy has been implicated in cancer biology and
 therapy resistance. We aimed to assess the impact of autophagy on
 chemotherapy response in EAC, with a special focus on paclitaxel.
 Responsiveness of EAC cell lines, OE19, FLO-1, OE33 and SK-GT-4, to
 paclitaxel was assessed using Alamar Blue assays. Autophagic flux upon
 paclitaxel treatment in vitro was assessed by immunoblotting of LC3B-II and
 quantitative assessment of WIP1 mRNA. Immunohistochemistry for the autophagy
 markers LC3B and p62 was applied on tumor tissue from 149 EAC patients
 treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including pre- and post-therapeutic
 samples (62 matched pairs). Tumor response was assessed by histology. For
 comparison, previously published data on 114 primary resected EAC cases were
 used. EAC cell lines displayed differing responsiveness to paclitaxel
 treatment; however this was not associated with differential autophagy
 regulation. High p62 cytoplasmic expression on its own (p </= 0.001), or in
 combination with low LC3B (p = 0.034), was associated with nonresponse to
 chemotherapy, regardless of whether or not the regiments contained
 paclitaxel, but there was no independent prognostic value of LC3B or p62
 expression patterns for EAC after neoadjuvant treatment. p62 and related
 pathways, most likely other than autophagy, play a role in chemotherapeutic
 response in EAC in a clinical setting. Therefore p62 could be a novel
 therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in EAC.",
