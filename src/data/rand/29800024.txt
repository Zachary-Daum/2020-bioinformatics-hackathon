    abstract "Purpose: This study examined the influence of cognitive factors
 on spoken word recognition in children with developmental language disorder
 (DLD) and typically developing (TD) children. Method: Participants included
 234 children (aged 7;0-11;11 years;months), 117 with DLD and 117 TD children,
 propensity matched for age, gender, socioeconomic status, and maternal
 education. Children completed a series of standardized assessment measures, a
 forward gating task, a rapid automatic naming task, and a series of tasks
 designed to examine cognitive factors hypothesized to influence spoken word
 recognition including phonological working memory, updating, attention
 shifting, and interference inhibition. Results: Spoken word recognition for
 both initial and final accept gate points did not differ for children with
 DLD and TD controls after controlling target word knowledge in both groups.
 The 2 groups also did not differ on measures of updating, attention
 switching, and interference inhibition. Despite the lack of difference on
 these measures, for children with DLD, attention shifting and interference
 inhibition were significant predictors of spoken word recognition, whereas
 updating and receptive vocabulary were significant predictors of speed of
 spoken word recognition for the children in the TD group. Conclusion:
 Contrary to expectations, after controlling for target word knowledge, spoken
 word recognition did not differ for children with DLD and TD controls;
 however, the cognitive processing factors that influenced children's ability
 to recognize the target word in a stream of speech differed qualitatively for
 children with and without DLDs.",
