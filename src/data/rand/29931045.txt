    abstract "Motivation: Multiple marker analysis of the genome-wide
 association study (GWAS) data has gained ample attention in recent years.
 However, because of the ultra high-dimensionality of GWAS data, such analysis
 is challenging. Frequently used penalized regression methods often lead to
 large number of false positives, whereas Bayesian methods are computationally
 very expensive. Motivated to ameliorate these issues simultaneously, we
 consider the novel approach of using non-local priors in an iterative
 variable selection framework. Results: We develop a variable selection
 method, named, iterative non-local prior based selection for GWAS, or
 GWASinlps, that combines, in an iterative variable selection framework, the
 computational efficiency of the screen-and-select approach based on some
 association learning and the parsimonious uncertainty quantification provided
 by the use of non-local priors. The hallmark of our method is the
 introduction of 'structured screen-and-select' strategy, that considers
 hierarchical screening, which is not only based on response-predictor
 associations, but also based on response-response associations and
 concatenates variable selection within that hierarchy. Extensive simulation
 studies with single nucleotide polymorphisms having realistic linkage
 disequilibrium structures demonstrate the advantages of our computationally
 efficient method compared to several frequentist and Bayesian variable
 selection methods, in terms of true positive rate, false discovery rate, mean
 squared error and effect size estimation error. Further, we provide empirical
 power analysis useful for study design. Finally, a real GWAS data application
 was considered with human height as phenotype. Availability and
 implementation: An R-package for implementing the GWASinlps method is
 available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWASinlps/index.html.
