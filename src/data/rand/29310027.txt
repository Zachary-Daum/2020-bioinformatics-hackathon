    abstract "In the present study, we attempted to develop novel class of
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inhibitors by exploring the pharmaceutically
 underexploited enzyme targets which are majorly involved in cell wall
 biosynthesis of mycobacteria. For this purpose glutamate racemase was
 selected which racemizes d-glutamate from l-glutamate, a key step in
 peptidoglycan synthesis. Furthermore, enzyme is neither expressed nor its
 product, d-glutamate is produced in mammals, and hence inhibiting this enzyme
 will have no vulnerable effect in host organism. A library of our in-house
 compounds were screened against glutamate racemase using a biophysical
 technique; thermal shift assay and further by enzyme inhibition assay to
 identify Lead 1 molecule. Lead 1 optimization and expansion resulted in
 twenty four compounds. Among the synthesized compounds twelve compounds shown
 good enzyme inhibition than Lead 1 (IC50 20.07+/-0.29muM). Among all the
 compounds; compound 22 (IC50 1.1+/-0.52muM) showed potent non-competitive
 mode of inhibition in enzyme assay. Further showed good susceptibility (in
 replicating bacteria) of MIC 8.72muM and bactericidal time dependant kill on
 dormant culture. It also exhibited significant activity in Mtb nutrient
 starvation model (2.5) and Mtb biofilm model (2.4) and in vivo M. marinum
 infected Zebra fish model studies (3.6) reduction at logarithmic scale.",
