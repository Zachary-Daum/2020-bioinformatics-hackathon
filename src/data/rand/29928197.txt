    abstract "Background: Parkinson's disease affects many motor processes
 including speech. Besides drug treatment, deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the
 subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) has developed as
 an effective therapy. Goal: We present a neural model that simulates a
 syllable repetition task and evaluate its performance when varying the level
 of dopamine in the striatum, and the level of activity reduction in the STN
 or GPi. Method: The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) is used to build a
 model of syllable sequencing through a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex
 circuit. The model is able to simulate a failing substantia nigra pars
 compacta (SNc), as occurs in Parkinson's patients. We simulate syllable
 sequencing parameterized by (i) the tonic dopamine level in the striatum and
 (ii) average neural activity in STN or GPi. Results: With decreased dopamine
 levels, the model produces syllable sequencing errors in the form of skipping
 and swapping syllables, repeating the same syllable, breaking and restarting
 in the middle of a sequence, and cessation (""freezing"") of sequences. We
 also find that reducing (inhibiting) activity in either STN or GPi reduces
 the occurrence of syllable sequencing errors. Conclusion: The model predicts
 that inhibiting activity in STN or GPi can reduce syllable sequencing errors
 in Parkinson's patients. Since DBS also reduces syllable sequencing errors in
 Parkinson's patients, we therefore suggest that STN or GPi inhibition is one
 mechanism through which DBS reduces syllable sequencing errors in Parkinson's
 patients.",
