    abstract "The search for potent and selective therapeutic agents is
 progressing by the study of natural compounds in plants. Plant-derived
 macromolecules are considered emerging therapeutic agents and an alternative
 to synthetic and small molecule drugs. Where it has long been known that
 plants possess medicinal properties, the compounds responsible for their
 action are in many cases still unknown: often only whole crude plant extracts
 or fractionated extracts are tested for the ability to inhibit common
 pathogens. Here, we present a fast protein liquid chromatography method for
 the separation of crude plant proteins. Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI; 24.2
 kDa) and lectin (31 kDa) were purified from Glycine max by liquid extraction
 followed by ion exchange column chromatography. The need for serial
 chromatographic separation steps has been eliminated by introducing more
 complex elution profiles hence reducing cost, time and improving recovery.
 The identity of KTI-A and lectin was confirmed by matrix assisted laser
 desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS). Cell
 proliferation assays using B16F1 melanoma cells revealed that both KTI and
 the monomeric lectin retained some antiproliferative activity. This method
 could be useful for rapid and cost-effective purification of bioactive
 compounds from plant material.",
