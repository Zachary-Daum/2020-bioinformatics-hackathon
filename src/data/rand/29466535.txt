    abstract "Purpose: Bilinguals tend to produce cognates (e.g., telephone in
 English and telefono in Spanish) more accurately than they produce
 noncognates (table/mesa). We tested whether the same holds for bilingual
 children with specific language impairment (SLI). Method: Participants
 included Spanish-English bilingual children (aged 5;0 to 9;11
 [years;months]), 25 with SLI and 92 without, who had comparable language
 experience. Cognate and noncognate items were taken from English and Spanish
 versions of the Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test (Brownell, 2000,
 2001). Results: Although bilingual children with language impairment named
 fewer items correctly overall, they accurately named cognates more often than
 noncognates, as did typically developing children. Independent of language
 ability, accurate naming of a cognate in one language strongly predicted
 accurate naming in the other language. Conclusion: Language impairment
 appears unrelated to the mechanism that produces a cognate advantage in
 naming accuracy. Given that correct performance for a difficult word in one
 language is associated with knowing its cognate in another, cognates may be
 particularly viable targets for language intervention in bilingual children
 with SLI.",
