    abstract "Background: Hypothyroidism is common in pregnancy. No study has
 determined the prevalence of hypothyroidism in term pregnancies in India.
 Aim: This study aims to determine the prevalence and correlates of
 hypothyroidism in women who delivered at a center in Karnal, Haryana, North
 India. Results: Indoor records of all women who had delivered at this centre
 from April 2016 to March 2017 were reviewed. The prevalence of hypothyroidism
 was 12.3%, of which 15.5% were diagnosed during pregnancy. The dose
 requirement of L-thyroxine ranged from 25 to 200 mug (mean 76.38 +- 43.02).
 With this, 80% were able to achieve trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating
 hormone targets. Hypothyroidism did not correlate with any medical or
 obstetric complications. Conclusion: Hypothyroidism is common in term
 pregnancies. If treated adequately, healthy fetomaternal outcomes can be
 achieved.",
