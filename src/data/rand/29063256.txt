    abstract "AIM: To evaluate inter-reader performance for cross-sectional
 area and fat quantification of bilateral sciatic nerves on MRI and assess
 correlations with anthropometrics. METHODS: In this IRB-approved,
 HIPPA-compliant study, three readers performed a cross-sectional analysis of
 3T lumbosacral plexus MRIs over an 18-month period. Image slices were
 evaluated at two levels (A and B). The sciatic nerve was outlined using a
 free hand region of interest tool on PACS. Proton-density fat fraction (FF)
 and cross-sectional areas were recorded. Inter-reader agreement was assessed
 using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Spearman correlation
 coefficients were used for correlations with age, BMI and height and Wilcoxon
 rank sum test was used to assess gender differences. RESULTS: A total of 67
 patients were included in this study with male to female ratio of 1:1.
 Inter-reader agreement was good to excellent for FF measurements at both
 levels (ICC=0.71-0.90) and poor for sciatic nerve areas (ICC=0.08-0.27).
 Positive correlations of sciatic FF and area were seen with age (p
 value<0.05). Males had significantly higher sciatic intraneural fat than
 females (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Fat quantification MRI is highly reproducible
 with significant positive correlations of sciatic FF and area with age, which
 may have implications for MRI diagnosis of sciatic neuropathy. KEY POINTS: *
 MR proton density fat fraction is highly reproducible at multiple levels. *
 Sciatic intraneural fat is positively correlated with increasing age (p <
 0.05). * Positive correlations exist between bilateral sciatic nerve areas
 and age (p < 0.05). * Males had significantly higher sciatic intraneural fat
 than females (p < 0.05).",
