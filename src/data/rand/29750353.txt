    abstract "The author describes his personal and professional journey in
 relation to the subject of the AJA 40(th) anniversary conference, 'Who is my
 Jung?' The first part of the paper covers his early life and his attempt to
 bring together two opposing parts within him: valuation of a scientific
 approach, and an interest in the inner world, dreams and the paranormal.
 Discussion of his professional life follows, including his relationship with
 Gerhard Adler, past problems and splits within the Jungian community and the
 author's attempts to heal these. The value of both remembering and forgetting
 is questioned. This leads onto ideas that bring value and meaning to his work
 and life, and which bridge the inner divisions he felt in his early life:
 notably Jung's focus on applying scientific theory to the mystery of the
 psyche, his relational attitude (exemplified by the dialectical process and
 his interest in countertransference) and his theory of synchronicity. Recent
 discussion in Jungian writing has questioned the nature of synchronistic
 experiences and explored how they may emerge naturally from complex systems.
 The paper ends the author's continuing journey with two personal vignettes
 describing how meaning may emerge from the unconscious.",
