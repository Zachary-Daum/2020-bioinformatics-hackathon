    abstract "INTRODUCTION: It is unknown whether cervical lymphadenectomy as
 a treatment for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
 (cSCCh&n) increases survival in elderly patients. The aim of this study is to
 determine whether this procedure has an influence on the survival of these
 patients, and whether the Short-Form Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI-SF) can
 be used as an alternative to age in the surgeon's estimation of elderly
 patient mortality. METHODS: The study population included all patients
 diagnosed with cSCCh&n consecutively treated between 2006 and 2011.
 Non-invasive, non-cutaneous carcinomas were excluded. Patients were grouped
 according to their age (<70, 70-79, 80-89, >90), CCI-SF (<3, >/=3) and
 presence (N1) or absence (N0) of cervical metastases. The dependent variable
 was the performance or not of cervical lymphadenectomy. A univariate survival
 analysis was performed according to the presence of metastases, a bivariate
 analysis for each of the independent variables according to the received
 treatment and a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: 416 cases were included. The
 mean survival time was greater in the N0 group. For each of the groups based
 on the presence of metastasis, the differences in the mean survival time
 according to age and CCI-SF were not significant, regardless of the treatment
 received. The multivariate analysis showed the influence of age (p=0.0001,
 OR=1.488, 95%CI=[1.318; 1.679]) and CCI-SF (p=0.001, OR=1.817, 95%CI=[1.257;
 2.627]) in the N0 group. In the N1 group only regional treatment has a
 positive influence on survival (p=0.048, OR=0.15, 95%CI=[0.023; 0.981]).
 CONCLUSIONS: CCI-SF and age are good mortality indicators in cSCCh&n N0
 patients, but not so in cSCCh&n N1 patients. In cSCCh&n N1 patients, regional
 treatment has a positive influence on survival. Differences cannot be
 affirmed in the mean survival time of patients with cSCCh&n, based on the
 development of metastases and the treatment given. New studies will be
 necessary.",
