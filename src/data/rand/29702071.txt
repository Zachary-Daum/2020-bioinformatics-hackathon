    abstract "BACKGROUND: Incentive spirometry (IS) is thought to reduce the
 incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) after lung
 resection. We sought to determine whether the addition of IS to routine
 physiotherapy following lung resection results in a lower rate of PPC, as
 compared with physiotherapy alone. METHODS: A single-blind prospective
 randomized controlled trial was conducted in adults undergoing lung
 resection. Individuals with previous lung surgery or home oxygen were
 excluded. Participants randomized to the control arm (PHY) received routine
 physiotherapy alone (deep breathing, ambulation and shoulder exercises).
 Those randomized to the intervention arm (PHY/IS) received IS in addition to
 routine physiotherapy. The trial was powered to detect a 10% difference in
 the rate of PPC (beta = 80%). Student's t test and chi-square were utilized
 for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, with a significance
 level of p = 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 387 participants (n = 195 PHY/IS; n =
 192 PHY) were randomized between 2014 and 2017. Baseline characteristics were
 comparable for both arms. The majority of patients underwent a pulmonary
 lobectomy (PHY/IS = 59.5%, PHY = 61.0%; p = 0.84), with no difference in the
 rates of minimally invasive and open procedures. There were no differences in
 the incidence of PPC at 30 days postoperatively (PHY/IS = 12.3%, PHY = 13.0%;
 p = 0.88). There were no differences in rates of pneumonia (PHY/IS = 4.6%,
 PHY = 7.8%; p = 0.21), mechanical ventilation (PHY/IS = 2.1%, PHY = 1.0%; p =
 0.41), home oxygen (PHY/IS = 13.8%, PHY = 14.6%; p = 0.89), hospital length
 of stay (PHY/IS = 4 days, PHY = 4 days; p = 0.34), or rate of readmission to
 hospital (PHY/IS = 10.3%, PHY = 9.9%; p = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of
 IS to routine postoperative physiotherapy does not reduce the incidence of
 PPC after lung resection.",
