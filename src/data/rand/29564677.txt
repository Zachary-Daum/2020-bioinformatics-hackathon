    abstract "Purpose During return to work (RTW), communication between
 health care providers and employers largely takes place through standardize
 paper-based forms. Information technology (IT) platforms may provide
 advantages in enabling information exchange and decision-making through
 sharing of guidelines and resources. We investigated stakeholder perspectives
 on the prospect of IT use for RTW communication in Ontario, Canada. Methods
 Consistent with the exploratory nature of the questions, qualitative methods
 were used. Primary data were interviews with health care providers (HCPs),
 employers, and workers with experience in RTW. The first portion of initial
 interviews elicited general perspectives and experiences related to RTW
 communication. Participants were then exposed to a prototype IT communication
 platform and elicited their feedback. Follow-up interviews with HCP's and EMP
's were used to allow further reflection and clarification of data. We used
 progressive, thematic coding to analyze data. Results 12 HCPs, 7 employers,
 and 5 workers participated in the study. Five inter-related themes were
 obtained. Participants expressed no absolute objection to the use of IT for
 RTW communication but varying degrees of support. Participants revealed how
 media change depended on a prospective IT innovation's perceived usefulness,
 fit with current practices, capacity to gain buy-in from other stakeholders,
 and ability to demonstrate positive performance in actual practice.
 Conclusions Findings suggest that a transition to an IT-mediated tool for RTW
 communication is supported in principle; however, major caveats exist in
 relation to perceived value and fit with stakeholder practice. System support
 and stakeholder cooperation are likely necessary to adopt the change, yet
 IT-mediated communication has yet to demonstrate value. To avoid circularity,
 proof of principal needs to be established through an implementation trial of
 such technology.",
