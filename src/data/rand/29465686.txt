    abstract "BACKGROUND: Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted
 infection associated with increased transmission of HIV and significant
 adverse birth outcomes; culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are
 commonly used in diagnosis. METHODS: Consenting HIV-infected pregnant women
 were recruited from clinics in South Africa and screened for T. vaginalis
 using PCR. Polymerase chain reaction-positive women provided an additional
 sample for culture. We compared T. vaginalis detection between PCR and
 culture, and investigated how PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values differ among
 culture results. RESULTS: A total of 359 women were enrolled and 76 (20%)
 tested T. vaginalis PCR positive. Cultures were obtained from 61 of the
 PCR-positive women, and 38 (62%) were culture positive. The median baseline
 Ct of the PCR-positive/culture-positive group was 22.6 versus 38.0 among
 those who were PCR positive/culture negative (P < 0.001). Culture-positive
 cases had lower Ct values (higher DNA load); a Ct value less than 30
 predicted positivity with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 96%.
 CONCLUSIONS: Culture was positive in roughly half of PCR-positive cases. The
 culture-negative cases had significantly higher Ct values, indicating a lower
 concentration of T. vaginalis DNA. A Ct value of 30 provides a reliable
 threshold for predicting culture positivity. The clinical significance of
 culture-negative infections detected by PCR is still unclear.",
