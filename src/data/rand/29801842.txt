    abstract "This work aims to explore the inclusion mechanism and structure
 of cinnamaldehyde (CNMA) and cyclodextrins (CDs), and to provide some
 theoretical information for the application of CNMA and its inclusion. In
 this study, we prepared three kinds of inclusion and investigated the
 mechanism and structure by theory and experiment. Molecular docking and
 dynamical simulations presented a stable 1:1 inclusion complex and the visual
 structure model. The structural features indicated that the benzene ring of
 CNMA was enclosed in the hydrophobic cavity of CDs, which were consistent
 with the results of (1)H NMR, 2D-ROESY, Fourier transform infrared
 spectroscopy. The inclusion mechanism studies showed that the inclusion
 process was driven mainly by enthalpy with the binding constant following the
 order of DM (dimethyl)>HP (hydroxypropyl)>beta-CD. Moreover, the inclusion
 complex showed an advantageous water solubility and dissolution rate compared
 with CNMA.",
