    abstract "The holobiont (host with its endocellular and extracellular
 microbiome) can function as a distinct biological entity, an additional
 organismal level to the ones previously considered, on which natural
 selection operates. The holobiont can function as a whole: anatomically,
 metabolically, immunologically, developmentally, and during evolution.
 Consideration of the holobiont with its hologenome as an independent level of
 selection in evolution has led to a better understanding of underappreciated
 modes of genetic variation and evolution. The hologenome is comprised of two
 complimentary parts: host and microbiome genomes. Changes in either genome
 can result in variations that can be selected for or against. The host genome
 is highly conserved, and genetic changes within it occur slowly, whereas the
 microbiome genome is dynamic and can change rapidly in response to the
 environment by increasing or reducing particular microbes, by acquisition of
 novel microbes, by horizontal gene transfer, and by mutation. Recent
 experiments showing that microbiota can play an initial role in speciation
 have been suggested as an additional mode of enhancing evolution. Some of the
 genetic variations can be transferred to offspring by a variety of
 mechanisms. Strain-specific DNA analysis has shown that at least some of the
 microbiota can be maintained across hundreds of thousands of host
 generations, implying the existence of a microbial core. We argue that rapid
 changes in the microbiome genome could allow holobionts to adapt and survive
 under changing environmental conditions thus providing the time necessary for
 the host genome to adapt and evolve. As Darwin wrote, ""It is not the
 strongest of the species that survives but the most adaptable"".",
