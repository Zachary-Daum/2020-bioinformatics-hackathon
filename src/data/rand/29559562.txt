    abstract "Purpose: Pathogenic POLE proofreading domain mutations are found
 in many malignancies where they are associated with ultramutation and
 favorable prognosis. The extent to which this prognosis depends on their
 sensitivity to adjuvant treatment is unknown, as is the optimal therapy for
 advanced-staged or recurrent POLE-mutant cancers.Experimental Design: We
 examined the recurrence-free survival of women with POLE-mutant and
 POLE-wild-type endometrial cancers (EC) in the observation arm of the
 randomized PORTEC-1 endometrial cancer trial (N = 245 patients with stage I
 endometrial cancer for analysis). Sensitivity to radiotherapy and selected
 chemotherapeutics was compared between Pole-mutant mouse-derived embryonic
 stem (mES) cells, generated using CRISPR-Cas9 (Pole mutations D275A/E275A,
 and cancer-associated P286R, S297F, V411L) and isogenic wild-type cell
 lines.Results: In the observation arm of the PORTEC-1 trial (N = 245), women
 with POLE-mutant endometrial cancers (N = 16) had an improved recurrence-free
 survival (10-year recurrence-free survival 100% vs. 80.1% for POLE-wild-type;
 HR, 0.143; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.996; P = 0.049). Pole mutations
 did not increase sensitivity to radiotherapy nor to chemotherapeutics in mES
 cells. In contrast, Pole-mutant cells displayed significantly increased
 sensitivity to cytarabine and fludarabine (IC50Pole P286R-mutant vs.
 wild-type: 0.05 vs. 0.17 mumol/L for cytarabine, 4.62 vs. 11.1 mumol/L for
 fludarabine; P < 0.001 for both comparisons).Conclusions: The favorable
 prognosis of POLE-mutant cancers cannot be explained by increased sensitivity
 to currently used adjuvant treatments. These results support studies
 exploring minimization of adjuvant therapy for early-stage POLE-mutant
 cancers, including endometrial and colorectal cancers. Conversely, POLE
 mutations result in hypersensitivity to nucleoside analogues, suggesting the
 use of these compounds as a potentially effective targeted treatment for
 advanced-stage POLE-mutant cancers. Clin Cancer Res; 24(13); 3197-203.
