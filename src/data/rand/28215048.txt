    abstract "Home healthcare services in Turkey are provided primarily to
 patients that are bedridden or seriously disabled. There are no such services
 integrated with hospital services that are specifically designed for cancer
 patients. The present study aimed to explore the home healthcare needs of
 cancer patients and their experiences related to unmet home healthcare needs.
 The study included 394 adult cancer patients who were followed up at the
 surgical oncology department of a university hospital. A 37-item,
 study-specific questionnaire and the European Organisation for Research and
 Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for cancer patients
 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) were administered, and patient clinical records were
 evaluated. Home healthcare was provided primarily by the patients' immediate
 family members; the professional home healthcare usage rate was only 2.8%.
 Patient quality of life (QoL) was negatively affected by cancer, especially
 those with stage three and four disease. The frequency of the need for home
 healthcare services due to disease-related health problems during the 30 days
 prior to administration of the questionnaires was as follows: pain (62.9%),
 surgical wound care (44.9%), injection of therapeutics (52.3%),
 gastrointestinal complaints (51.8%), anxiety (87.1%), psychosocial assistance
 (77.2%) and information about cancer (94.4%). In the absence of home
 healthcare services, the patients primarily used institutional healthcare
 services to meet their needs; otherwise, their needs were not met. The
 physical and psychosocial problems that cancer patients experience could be
 solved in most cases by professional home healthcare services.
 Hospital-integrated home healthcare services might not only improve cancer
 patient QoL but might also increase the effectiveness of hospital-based
 healthcare services.",
