    abstract "We assessed the efficacy and safety of direct oral
 anticoagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in
 the chronic phase through comparison with conventional warfarin therapy.A
 total of 807 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with having DVT in the
 chronic phase were included (484 patients to warfarin therapy and 323
 patients to DOAC therapy). The condition of leg veins was assessed 3 to 6
 months after starting the therapies by ultrasound examination. Major bleeding
 and mortality during the therapies were followed-up.There was no significant
 difference between the two groups in the thrombosis improvement rate (DOAC
 group: 91.2% versus warfarin group: 88.9%). There was no significant
 difference between the two groups in major bleeding (DOAC group: 1.8% versus
 warfarin group: 1.8%). In patients with active cancer, the DOAC group had a
 borderline higher thrombosis improvement rate than the warfarin group (92.1%
 versus 80.0%, P = 0.05). The proportion of major bleeding in the patients
 with active cancer was slightly higher in the warfarin group than in the DOAC
 group (4.3% versus 2.8%; P = 0.71). Active cancer was not an independent risk
 factor for major bleeding and recurrence in the DOAC group (OR 2.68, 95% CI
 0.51-14.1; P = 0.24 and OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.20-2.07; P = 0.47).In treatment
 using oral anticoagulants for DVT in the chronic phase, DOACs exhibited equal
 efficacy and safety as warfarin did. Particularly DOACs appear to be an
 attractive therapeutic option for cancer-associated DVT in chronic phase,
 with relatively low anticipated rates of recurrence and major bleeding.",
