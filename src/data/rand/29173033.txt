    abstract "In clinical trials, patient's disease severity is usually
 assessed on a Likert-type scale. Patients, however, may miss one or more
 follow-up visits (non-monotone missing). The statistical analysis of
 non-Gaussian longitudinal data with non-monotone missingness is difficult to
 handle, particularly when both response and time-dependent covariates are
 subject to such missingness. Even when the number of patients with
 intermittent missing data is small, ignoring those patients from analysis
 seems to be unsatisfactory. The focus of the current investigation is to
 study the progression of Alzheimer's disease by incorporating a non-ignorable
 missing data mechanism for both response and covariates in a longitudinal
 setup. Combining the cumulative logit longitudinal model for Alzheimer's
 disease progression with the bivariate binary model for the missing pattern,
 we develop a joint likelihood. The parameters are then estimated using the
 Monte Carlo Newton Raphson Expectation Maximization (MCNREM) method. This
 approach is quite easy to handle and the convergence of the estimates is
 attained in a reasonable amount of time. The study reveals that
 apolipo-protein plays a significant role in assessing a patient's disease
 severity. A detailed simulation has also been carried out for justifying the
 performance of our approach.",
