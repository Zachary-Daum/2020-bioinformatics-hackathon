    abstract "In this study, it was aimed to show the cannabinoid receptor-2
 (CB2) role, which is a part of neuroprotective endocannabinoidal system,
 against increasing nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS, eNOS) levels and the
 apoptotic activity (caspase-3, caspase-9, and DNA in situ fragmentation)
 within the postnatal critical period in pups of pregnant rats with
 artificially induced maternal thyroid hormone (TH) deficiency. Each of the
 three groups established comprised one male and two female rats, and they
 were coupled. Their pups were used. In the first two groups, the mothers were
 treated with 0.025% MMI during the critical period of the pregnancy. In the
 third group, as the control group, the mothers and pups were not treated.
 Euthanasia was applied to the pups in Group I on Day 10, and to the pups in
 Groups II and III on Day 21. In the biochemical analyses, total T4 levels of
 both mothers and pups in Group I and II were found to be lower than those of
 the control group. Histopathologically, karyopyknosis in migrating neurons
 and demyelinization were observed in both groups. Caspase-3 and -9
 expressions and TUNEL reactions showed parallelism to these findings. eNOS
 and iNOS activities were also increased in Groups I and II. CB2 receptor
 activity was observed in the fore and mid brain in Group I, and in the whole
 brain in Group II. In conclusion, apoptosis was triggered via oxidative
 stress in hypothyroid pups. Accordingly, neuroprotective activity of CB2
 receptors were motivated spontaneously to resist to CNS lesions during the
 first 3 weeks of postnatal period. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop
