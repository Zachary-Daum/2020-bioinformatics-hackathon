    abstract "Artificial reefs, in the Eastern Mediterranean (Cyprus,) became
 a popular and frequently used tool, in fisheries and biodiversity
 conservation management. Even though evaluation studies about the efficacy of
 artificial reefs are plentiful in the rest of the Mediterranean (Central and
 Western), in the Eastern Basin they are largely absent. As the Eastern part
 of the Mediterranean Sea is characterised by unique physical parameters, the
 necessity to study artificial reefs under these contrasting regimes
 increases. The epibenthic communities of two unintentional artificial reefs
 (modern shipwrecks) in Cyprus (Zenobia) and Lebanon (Alice-B) were evaluated
 in 2010. Both shipwrecks are at similar depth, type of sea bottom, made of
 the same material (steel) and were sunk approximately the same period of
 time. However, Alice-B shipwreck off the coast of Lebanon is constantly
 exposed to higher levels of nutrients than Zenobia in Cyprus. Significant
 dissimilarities were observed in the composition, percentage of benthic cover
 of predominant taxonomic groups and development of the epibenthic
 communities. Differences in physical and chemical parameters between sides
 lay mainly in the nutrient and thermal regimes affecting the shipwrecks and
 most likely bring about the differences in the observed community structure.
 The results of this study suggest that epibenthic communities could be highly
 impacted by eutrophication caused by anthropogenic activities, leading to
 less biodiverse communities dominated by specific species that are favoured
 by the eutrophic conditions.",
