    abstract "BACKGROUND: Approximately 25% of the residents' time in each
 shift is allocated to educating lower-level assistants and interns.
 Assistants have played a major role in interns' education. AIM: To assess the
 teaching abilities of emergency medicine assistants in the training and
 monitoring of medical interns and undergraduate students. METHODS: This
 cross-sectional study was performed in 2015 at the emergency center of Imam
 Reza hospital in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. We employed a
 researcher-made questionnaire to search the capability of emergency medicine
 residents to assess the teaching capabilities of emergency medicine residents
 to interns. This questionnaire was completed by 106 interns. The Validity of
 the questionnaire was confirmed by three specialist experts and reliability
 of the questionnaire was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha (0.94). This
 questionnaire consists of 24 questions in six areas. The analysis was
 performed by descriptive statistics using SPSS 16. RESULT: The study showed
 that the least favorable score was related to ""residents get feedback on
 each shift"" and the highest score was given to ""a friendly relationship
 with the Interns and residents"". CONCLUSION: Considering the key role of
 residents in the education and training of future healthcare specialists,
 training interventions and allocating sufficient time to the proper education
 of different members of healthcare teams and medical students could largely
 contribute to the development of clinical training systems.",
