    abstract "BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to describe a single-center
 experience using combined extra-anatomic open arch branch revascularization
 with aortic arch endovascular exclusion for treatment of aberrant subclavian
 artery aneurysms. METHODS: All patients undergoing management of aberrant
 subclavian aneurysms were identified from a prospective patient registry.
 Means of revascularization included carotid-subclavian bypass or subclavian
 transposition, and origin occlusion was performed by surgical ligation or
 endovascular embolization at surgeon discretion. Completion of aneurysm
 exclusion was performed using available distal arch/thoracic aortic
 endografts (TEVARs) using standard oversizing. Procedures were staged as
 appropriate based on patient condition. RESULTS: Ten patients, 8 females and
 2 males ranging from 32 to 85 years of age, were identified. Presenting
 symptoms were dysphagia (n = 9) and acute type B aortic dissection (n = 1).
 All patients required revascularization/exclusion of bilateral subclavian
 arteries to enable >20 mm proximal aortic fixation distal to the common
 carotid origins for the arch endograft. TEVAR with planned coverage of both
 subclavian origins extending into the proximal descending thoracic aorta was
 performed using transfemoral access (n = 9) or iliac conduit (n = 1) and
 required a single device (100-157 mm) in all cases except the aortic
 dissection which required total length coverage of the descending thoracic
 aorta. Extra-anatomic revascularization and thoracic endografting were staged
 by 1-2 days in most cases to minimize potential airway edema from bilateral
 neck exposures. Subclavian revascularization was performed by
 carotid-subclavian bypass using polytetrafluoroethylene (n = 17) or
 subclavian transposition (n = 3) with proximal occlusion using embolization
 with an Amplatzer II plug (n = 11) or ligation (n = 9). No major
 complications occurred including spinal cord ischemia, stroke, cranial nerve
 deficit, arm ischemia, access site complications, or wound complications.
 Length of stay ranged from 6 to 21 days with all patients having resolution
 of dysphagia on follow-up (mean 41 months). Directed imaging was available
 for 7 patients demonstrating the absence of endoleak, regression or stability
 of aneurysm size, and patency of all subclavian revascularizations.
 CONCLUSIONS: We present a hybrid repair technique with low operative
 morbidity that has shown to be durable in follow-up and to provide
 symptomatic relief for patients with aberrant subclavian artery aneurysms
 causing esophageal compression.",
