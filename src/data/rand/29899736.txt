    abstract "Potato is prone to many drastic diseases like potato common scab
 (CS). As no highly effective methods exist for managing CS, this study
 explored the possibility of using biological control. Ten bacterial strains
 were isolated from CS-infected potato tubers from four different locations of
 Punjab, Pakistan, and identified based on biochemical and molecular analysis.
 Analysis of 16s rDNA sequences amplified by PCR revealed the isolated
 bacterial strains to be Streptomyces scabies, S. turgidiscabies and S.
 stelliscabiei. Pathogenic islands were also confirmed among the isolates
 after identification of txtAB, nec1, and tomA genes with PCR amplification.
 One strain isolated from soil was antagonistic to the pathogenic Streptomyces
 spp., and determined to be Streptomyces A1RT on the basis of 16s rRNA
 sequencing. A methanolic extract of Streptomyces A1RT contained Isatropolone
 C, which was purified and structurally determined by (1)H- and (13)C-NMR,
 (1)H/(1)H-COSY, HMQC, and HMBC techniques. Streptomyces A1RT also produced
 the plant growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) with a titer of 26 mug
 ml(-1) as confirmed by spectrophotometry and HPLC. In a greenhouse assay,
 disease severity index was established from 0 to 500. Average disease
 severity indexes were recorded as 63, 130.5, and 78 for Streptomyces scabies,
 S. turgidiscabies and S. stelliscabiei, respectively. When Streptomyces A1RT
 was applied in soil that contained one of these pathogenic isolates, the
 average disease severity indexes were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced to
 11.1, 5.6 and 8.4, respectively. A significant increase in tuber weight and
 shoot development was also observed with the tubers treated with Streptomyces
 A1RT. The use of the plant growth-promoting Streptomyces A1RT against potato
 CS thus provides an alternative strategy to control the disease without
 affecting environmental, plants, animals and human health.",
