    abstract "Newly erupted black smokers (hydrothermal vent chimneys) are
 sterile during their formation, but house hyperthermophilic microorganisms in
 substantial amounts in later stages. No direct experimental data exist by
 which mechanisms hyperthermophiles colonize newly erupted black smokers, but
 a scenario was proposed recently how this might happen. Here we combine high
 temperature light microscopy with electron microscopy to show that two
 hyperthermophilic Archaea, namely Pyrococcus furiosus and Methanocaldococcus
 villosus are able to adhere onto authentic black smoker material (BSM). We
 especially are able to directly observe the adhesion process via video
 recordings taken at high temperatures. These data validate the hypothesis
 that hyperthermophiles are transferred by serendipitous water currents to the
 outside of newly formed black smokers and react within seconds to the there
 prevailing high temperatures by very fast movements. They scan the surface of
 the hydrothermal chimneys via a much slower zigzag seek-movement and adhere
 via their flagella at a suitable place, building up biofilms.",
