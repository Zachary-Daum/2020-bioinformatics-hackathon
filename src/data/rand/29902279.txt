    abstract "One of the newly developed methods for Assimilable organic
 carbon (AOC) determination is leveraged on the cell enumeration by flow
 cytometry (FC) which could provide a rapid and automated solution for AOC
 measurement. However, cell samples staining with fluorescence dye is
 indispensable to reduce background and machine noise. This step would bring
 additional cost and time consuming for this method. In this study, a green
 fluorescence protein (GFP) tagged strain derived of AOC testing strain
 Pseudomonas fluorescens P-17 (GFP-P17) was generated using Tn5 transposon
 mutagenesis. Continuous culture of this mutant GFP-P17 showed stable
 expression of eGFP signal detected by flow cytometry without staining step.
 In addition, this GFP-P17 strain displayed faster growth rate and had a wider
 range of carbon substrate utilization patterns as compared with P17
 wild-type. With this strain, the capability of a new FC method with no dye
 staining was explored in standard acetate solution, which suggests linear
 correlation of counts with acetate carbon concentration. Furthermore, this FC
 method with GFP-P17 strain is applicable in monitoring GAC/BAC efficiency and
 condition as similar trends of AOC level in water treatment process were
 measured by both FC method and conventional spread plating count method.
 Therefore, this fast and easily applicable GFP-P17 based FC method could
 serve as a tool for routine microbiological drinking water monitoring.",
