    abstract "Sweat is a biological fluid present on the skin surface of every
 individual and is known to contain amino acids as well as other low molecular
 weight compounds. (1) Each individual is inherently different from one
 another based on certain factors including, but not limited to, his/her
 genetic makeup, environment, and lifestyle. As such, the biochemical
 composition of each person greatly differs. The concentrations of the
 biochemical content within an individual's sweat are largely controlled by
 metabolic processes within the body that fluctuate regularly based on
 attributes such as age, sex, and activity level. Therefore, the
 concentrations of these sweat components are person-specific and can be
 exploited, as presented here, to differentiate individuals based on trace
 amounts of sweat. For this concept, we analyzed three model
 compounds-lactate, urea, and glutamate. The average absorbance change from
 each compound in sweat was determined using three separate bioaffinity-based
 systems: lactate oxidase coupled with horseradish peroxidase (LOx-HRP),
 urease coupled with glutamate dehydrogenase (UR-GlDH), and glutamate
 dehydrogenase alone (GlDH). After optimization of a linear dependence for
 each assay to its respective analyte, analysis was performed on 50 mimicked
 sweat samples. Additionally, a collection and extraction method was developed
 and optimized by our group to evaluate authentic sweat samples from the skin
 surface of 25 individuals. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test
 was performed to demonstrate that these three single-analyte enzymatic assays
 were effectively used to identify each person in both sample sets. This novel
 sweat analysis approach is capable of differentiating individuals, without
 the use of DNA, based on the collective responses from the chosen metabolic
 compounds in sweat. Applications for this newly developed, noninvasive
 analysis can include the field of forensic science in order to differentiate
 between individuals as well as the fields of homeland security and
 cybersecurity for personal authentication via unlocking mechanisms in smart
 devices that monitor metabolites. Through further development and analysis,
 this concept also has the potential to be clinically applicable in monitoring
 the health of individuals based on particular biomarker combinations.",
