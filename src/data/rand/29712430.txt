    abstract "The adsorption-desorption behavior of polymer chains is at the
 heart of macromolecular surface science and technology. With the current
 developments in atomic force microscopy (AFM), it has now become possible to
 address the desorption problem from the perspective of a single
 macromolecule. Here, we report on desorption of single polymer chains on
 planar surfaces by AFM-based single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) as a
 function of the pulling angle with respect to the surface-normal direction.
 SMFS experiments were performed in water with various substrates using
 different polymers covalently attached to the AFM probe tip. End-grafting at
 the AFM tip was achieved by surface-initiated polymerization using initiator
 functionalized tips. We found that the desorption force increases with a
 decreasing pulling angle, i.e., an enhanced adhesion of the polymer chain was
 observed. The magnitude of the desorption force shows a weak angular
 dependence at pulling angles close to the surface normal. A significant
 increase of the force is observed at shallower pulling from a certain pulling
 angle. This behavior carries the signature of an adsorption-desorption
 transition. The angular dependence of the normalized desorption force
 exhibits a universal behavior. We compared and interpreted our results using
 theoretical predictions for single-chain adsorption-desorption transitions.",
