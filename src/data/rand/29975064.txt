    abstract "The low intrinsic conductivity of sulfur necessitates conductive
 additives, such as mesoporous carbons, to the cathode to enable
 high-performance metal-sulfur batteries. Simultaneous efforts to address
 polysulfide shuttling have introduced nitrogen-doped carbons to provide both
 conductivity and suppressed shuttling because of their strong interaction
 with sulfur. The strength of this interaction will impact the ability to fill
 the mesopores with sulfur via melt infusion. Here, we systematically
 investigate how nitrogen doping influences the rate that molten sulfur can
 infiltrate the mesopores and the overall extent of pore filling of highly
 ordered mesoporous doped carbons using in situ small angle X-ray scattering
 (SAXS). The similarity in electron density between molten sulfur and the soft
 carbon framework of the mesoporous material leads to a precipitous decrease
 in the scattered intensity associated with the ordered structure as voids are
 filled with sulfur. As the nitrogen doping increases from 1 to 20 at. %, the
 effective diffusivity of sulfur in the mesopores decreases by an order of
 magnitude (2.7 x 10(-8) to 2.3 x 10(-9) cm/s). The scattering becomes nearly
 invariant within 20 min of melt infiltration at 155  degrees C for all but
 the most doped carbon, which indicates that submicron-sized mesoporous carbon
 particles can be filled rapidly. Additionally, the nitrogen doping decreases
 the sulfur content that can be accommodated within the mesopores from 95% of
 the mesopores filled without doping to only 64% filled with 20 at. % N as
 determined by the residual scattering intensity. Sulfur does not crystallize
 within the mesopores of the nitrogen-doped carbons, which is further
 indicative of the strong interactions between the nitrogen species and sulfur
 that can inhibit polysulfide shuttling. In situ SAXS provides insights into
 the diffusion of sulfur in mesopores and how the surface chemistry of
 nitrogen-doped carbon appears to significantly hinder the infiltration by
 sulfur.",
