    abstract "Analysis of Fire Service Instructors (FSI) working practices and
 health is needed to minimise health risks related to heat illness,
 cardiovascular events and immunological stress. Online surveys were
 distributed to UK FSI and Firefighters (FF). One hundred and thirty FSI (age:
 43 +/- 7yrs) and 232 FF (age: 41 +/- 8yrs) responded. FSI experienced 2-10
 live fires per week, with 45% of FSI reporting management does not set a
 limit on the number of exposures. Few FSI followed hydration guidelines, or
 cooling methods. New symptoms of ill health were reported by 41% of FSI and
 21% of FF. FSI with >/=11 Breathing Apparatus exposures per month were 4.5
 times (95% CI 1.33-15.09) more likely to experience new symptoms. A large
 proportion of FSI are experiencing new symptoms of illness after starting
 their career, and guidelines on exposure and hydration are not universally in
 place to reduce the risk of future health problems.",
