    abstract "Rutin has a wide range of beneficial health properties in the
 amelioration of multi-organ injury owing to its various biological effects.
 The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of rutin on
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced heart injury and clarify its potential
 cardioprotective mechanism. The mouse model of heart injury was
 intraperitoneal infection with LPS, and rutin was orally administered for 8
 consecutive days. One day after LPS injection, heart histopathology, cardiac
 marker enzymes and cardiac fibrosis related genes were determined to evaluate
 the cardioprotective effects of rutin. In addition, oxidative parameters and
 inflammatory cytokines were tested to explore its possible underlying
 mechanism. The presented results showed that rutin significantly improved
 morphological changes of myocardium and relieved cardiac marker enzymes
 [creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] level to protect heart
 in LPS-induced sepsis. And more, rutin observably mitigated fibrosis related
 genes [matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9
 (MMP-9)] expression in the heart to prevent against LPS-induced cardiac
 fibrosis. In addition, rutin markedly increased antioxidant enzymes
 [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)] activity, and improved
 oxidative production [malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2] level to balance the
 oxidation and anti-oxidation systems in the heart. Lastly, rutin dramatically
 ameliorated [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6
 (IL-6)] activity to restrain inflammatory responses in the heart. In
 conclusion, rutin possessed anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties to
 improve LPS-induced heart injury, which suggested rutin could be used as a
 potential cardioprotective medicine in sepsis.",
