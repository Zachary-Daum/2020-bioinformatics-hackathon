    abstract "Adaptive radiation is an important evolutionary process, through
 which a single ancestral lineage rapidly gives rise to multiple newly formed
 lineages that specialize in different niches. In the first-arrival
 hypothesis, David Lack emphasized the importance of species colonization
 history for adaptive radiation, suggesting that the earlier arrival of a
 diversifying species would allow it to radiate to a greater extent. Here, we
 report on the first rigorous experimental test of this hypothesis, using the
 rapidly evolving bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and six different
 bacterial competitors. We show that the earlier arrival of P. fluorescens
 facilitated its diversification. Nevertheless, significant effects of
 colonization history, which led to alternative diversification trajectories,
 were observed only when the competitors shared similar niche and competitive
 fitness with P. fluorescens. These results highlight the important role of
 species colonization history, modified by their ecological differences, for
 adaptive radiation.",
