    abstract "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate quality-of-life
 changes up to 10 years following three different radiotherapy concepts.
 METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the years 2000-2003, 295 patients were treated with
 external beam radiotherapy (EBRT; n = 135; 70.2 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions),
 low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT with I-125; n = 94; 145 Gy), and
 high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT with Ir-192; n = 66; 18 Gy in two
 fractions using 4-6 needles) as a boost to EBRT (50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy
 fractions). Quality of life was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer
 Index Composite at median time of 2, 6, and 10 years after treatment.
 RESULTS: The urinary function score 2 years after EBRT (mean 93 points) was
 significantly higher in comparison to HDR-BT + EBRT (80 points, higher doses
 to the urethra relevant) and LDR-BT (88 points). After 10 years, only HDR-BT
 + EBRT (75 points) remained worse (LDR-BT 92 points; EBRT 91 points). Urinary
 incontinence score decreased from 83 to 76 points in the HDR-BT + EBRT group.
 No significant differences or changes resulted in the bowel domain. The mean
 sexual function score (i.e., sexuality score) was significantly higher after
 LDR-BT versus HDR-BT + EBRT and EBRT (30 vs. 19 and 24 points after 2 years
 and 25 vs. 13 and 15 points after 10 years, respectively)-a lower patient age
 and a lower percentage with hormonal treatment need to be considered.
 CONCLUSION: Apart from decreasing sexual function for all patients,
 decreasing urinary scores were found in the HDR-BT + EBRT group predominantly
 as a result of increasing incontinence. This study demonstrates the need for
 optimum BT treatment planning.",
