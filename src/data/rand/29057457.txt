    abstract "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuromedin U (NmU) may be a novel target
 for obesity treatment owing to its anorectic and energy expenditure enhancing
 effects. Although two receptors, NMU1 and NMU2, are both responsible for the
 NmU-mediated anti-obesity effects, the receptor agonist with the most
 appropriate profiles for treating obesity and diabetes in terms of efficacy
 and safety is as yet unknown. Thus, we developed and evaluated novel NMU1/2
 receptor-selective agonists. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Efficacy and safety were
 assessed in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) and those with
 leptin-deficient diabetes (ob/ob) through repeated peripheral administration
 of selective agonists to NMU1 (NMU-6102) and NMU2 (NMU-2084), along with
 non-selective NMU1/2 agonists (NMU-0002 and NMU-6014). We also performed
 immunohistochemistry for c-Fos protein expression in the brain to probe their
 mechanisms of action. KEY RESULTS: Although both non-selective NMU1/2
 agonists and the NMU2-selective agonist had high efficacy compared with the
 NMU1-selective agonist, only the NMU2-selective agonist led to relatively low
 adverse effects, such as diarrhoea, in DIO mice. However, the non-selective
 NMU1/2 agonist and the NMU1-selective agonist, but not the NMU2-selective
 agonist, were effective in diabetic ob/ob mice. Mechanistically,
 NMU2-selective agonists preferentially activate pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
 in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus but not in the paraventricular nucleus.
 CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that an NMU2
 receptor-selective agonist may be a well-balanced drug for the treatment of
 obesity and that an NMU1 receptor-selective agonist may also be beneficial
 for treating obesity and diabetes once its side effects are minimized.",
