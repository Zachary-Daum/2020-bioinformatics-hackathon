    abstract "Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms are associated with
 social difficulties in children, though findings are mixed and many studies
 have used global measures of social impairment. The present study tested the
 hypothesis that SCT would be uniquely associated with aspects of social
 functioning characterized by withdrawal and isolation, whereas attention
 deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)
 symptoms would be uniquely associated with aspects of social functioning
 characterized by inappropriate responding in social situations and active
 peer exclusion. Participants were 158 children (70% boys) between 7-12 years
 of age being evaluated for possible ADHD. Both parents and teachers completed
 measures of SCT, ADHD, ODD, and internalizing (anxiety/depression) symptoms.
 Parents also completed ratings of social engagement and self-control.
 Teachers also completed measures assessing asociality and exclusion, as well
 as peer ignoring and dislike. In regression analyses controlling for
 demographic characteristics and other psychopathology symptoms,
 parent-reported SCT symptoms were significantly associated with lower social
 engagement (e.g., starting conversations, joining activities).
 Teacher-reported SCT symptoms were significantly associated with greater
 asociality/withdrawal and ratings of more frequent ignoring by peers, as well
 as greater exclusion. ODD symptoms and ADHD hyperactive-impulsive symptoms
 were more consistently associated with other aspects of social behavior,
 including peer exclusion, being disliked by peers, and poorer self-control
 during social situations. Findings provide the clearest evidence to date that
 the social difficulties associated with SCT are primarily due to withdrawal,
 isolation, and low initiative in social situations. Social skills training
 interventions may be effective for children displaying elevated SCT
 symptomatology.",
