    abstract "Aim: Chemical sterilization is a non-surgical method of
 contraception based on compounds injected into the testis to induce
 infertility. However, these injections can cause discomfort and pain able to
 impair the recovery of animals after this treatment. The objective of this
 study was to investigate if anti-inflammatories or pain relievers inhibited
 the sterilizing effect of zinc gluconate-based solution on the testis.
 Materials and Methods: Adult rats were treated in groups: G1 (control), G2
 (dimethyl sulfoxide + dipyrone); G3 (dipyrone/zinc); G4 (dipyrone +
 celecoxib/zinc); G5 (dipyrone + meloxicam/zinc), and G6 (dipyrone +
 dexamethasone/zinc) in a single dose per day during 7 days. Animals were
 analyzed at 7, 15, and 30 days after treatments. Results: The zinc-induced a
 widespread testicular degeneration and decreased testosterone levels even in
 combination with anti-inflammatories or pain relievers. Testis, epididymis,
 prostate, and seminal vesicle had a weight reduction. The anti-inflammatory
 effect of dexamethasone interfered in the desired action of zinc gluconate in
 the 1(st) 15 days and celecoxib up to 7 days. Conclusion: Meloxicam plus
 dipyrone did not impair the chemical sterilization based on zinc gluconate,
 and it can be used to reduce nociceptive effects in animals after chemical
 sterilization.",
