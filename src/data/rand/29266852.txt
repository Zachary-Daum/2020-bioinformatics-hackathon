    abstract "SCOPE: Obesity is a fibroblast growth factor 21
 (FGF21)-resistant state. Since FGF21 production and signaling are regulated
 by some bioactive dietary compounds, we analyze the impact of Mediterranean
 tomato-based sofrito sauce on: (i) the FGF21 expression and signaling in
 visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT), and (ii) the insulin sensitivity of
 obese Zucker rats (OZR). METHODS AND RESULTS: OZR are fed with a
 sofrito-supplemented diet or control diet. Insulin sensitivity and FGF21
 signaling are determined. We observed that sofrito is able to improve the
 responsiveness to both hormones in obese rats. Sofrito-supplemented diet
 increases FGF21 signaling in vWAT by inducing the expression of the FGF
 receptors (FGFR1 and FGFR4) that promotes the expression of canonical target
 genes, like Egr-1, c-Fos and uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1). CONCLUSIONS: A
 sofrito-supplemented diet improves insulin and FGF21 sensitivity in OZR,
 explaining part of sofrito's healthy effects on glucose metabolism. In
 addition, induction of UCP1 and the unchanged body weight despite the
 hyperphagic behavior of the sofrito-fed rats suggests that the increase in
 FGF21 signaling correlates with an increase in energy expenditure (EE).
 Further studies in humans may help to understand whether sofrito consumption
 increases the EE in obese individuals.",
