    abstract "The present study aimed to investigate the potential roles and
 regulatory mechanism of microRNA (miR)-3941 in lipopolysaccharides
 (LPS)induced acute pneumonia. The expression of miR3941 in child patients
 with acute pneumonia was detected and A549 cells were treated with LPS to
 establish the cellular model of acute pneumonia. The effects of miR3941 in
 LPSinduced cell injury were investigated by assessing cell viability,
 apoptosis and inflammation. In addition, the regulatory relationship between
 miR3941 and insulinlike growth factor 2 (IGF2) was explored, as well as the
 association between miR3941 and the phosphatidylinositol4,5bisphosphate
 3kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway. miR3941 was significantly
 downregulated in patients with acute pneumonia (P<0.01). In the cell model of
 acute pneumonia, LPS treatment significantly induced cell injury via
 inhibiting cell viability (P<0.05 or P<0.01), inducing cell apoptosis
 (P<0.01) and enhancing the production of cytokines [interleukin (IL)6, IL8
 and tumor necrosis factoralpha; P<0.01 or P<0.001]. LPS treatment also
 resulted in a significantly decreased expression of miR3941 in A549 cells
 (P<0.01) and the overexpression of miR3941 significantly alleviated
 LPSinduced cell injury (P<0.05). In addition, IGF2 was confirmed as a direct
 target gene of miR3941. Knockdown of IGF2 significantly alleviated LPSinduced
 cell injury (P<0.05, P<0.01 or P<0.001), which was significantly reversed by
 suppression of miR3941 (P<0.05, P<0.01 or P<0.001). Furthermore, inhibition
 of miR3941 was demonstrated to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, which was
 inhibited following knockdown of IGF2. The present study indicates that
 miR3941 is downregulated in child patients with acute pneumonia and that
 downregulation of miR3941 may promote LPSinduced cell injury in A549 cells
 via targeting IGF2 to regulate the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
 Therefore, miR3941 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of
 acute pneumonia in child patients.",
