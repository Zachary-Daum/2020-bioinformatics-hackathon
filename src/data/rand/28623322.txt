    abstract "Despite their seemingly random appearances in the real space,
 quasi-random nanophotonic structures exhibit distinct structural correlations
 and have been widely utilized for effective photon management. However,
 current design approaches mainly rely on the deterministic representations
 consisting two-dimensional (2D) discretized patterns in the real space. They
 fail to capture the inherent non-deterministic characteristic of the
 quasi-random structures and inevitably result in a large design
 dimensionality. Here, we report a new design approach that employs the
 one-dimensional (1D) spectral density function (SDF) as the unique
 representation of non-deterministic quasi-random structures in the Fourier
 space with greatly reduced design dimensionality. One 1D SDF representation
 can be used to generate infinite sets of real space structures in 2D with
 equally optimized performance, which was further validated experimentally
 using light-trapping structures in a thin film absorber as a model system.
 The optimized non-deterministic quasi-random nanostructures improve the
 broadband absorption by 225% over the unpatterned cell.",
