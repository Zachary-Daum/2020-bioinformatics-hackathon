    abstract "Rapid declines in legacy poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances
 (PFASs) have been reported in human populations globally following changes in
 production since 2000. However, changes in exposure sources are not well
 understood. Here, we report serum concentrations of 19 PFASs ( summation
 operator19PFAS) measured in children between 1993 and 2012 from a North
 Atlantic fishing community (Faroe Islands). Median  summation operator19PFAS
 concentrations in children (ages 5-13 years) peaked in 2000 (47.7 ng mL(-1))
 and declined significantly by 14.4% year(-1) until 2012. Principal component
 analysis (PCA) identified two groups of PFASs that likely reflect exposures
 from diverse consumer products and a third group that consisted of
 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) with nine or more carbons (C >/= 9). These
 C >/= 9 PFASs are strongly associated with mercury in children's hair, a
 well-established proxy for seafood consumption, especially
 perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA, r = 0.72). Toxicokinetic modeling shows
 PFAS exposures from seafood have become increasingly important (53% of
 perfluorooctanesulfonate, PFOS, in 2012), despite a decline in whale
 consumption in recent years. We infer that even in a major seafood-consuming
 population, declines in legacy PFAS exposure after 2000 were achieved by the
 rapid phase out of PFOS and its precursors in consumer products. These
 results emphasize the importance of better understanding exposures to
 replacement PFASs in these sources.",
