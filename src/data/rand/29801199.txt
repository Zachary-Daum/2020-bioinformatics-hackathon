    abstract "Farmland top soils and soil profiles situated in the karst area
 of Guilin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, southern China, reveal different
 degrees of heavy metal pollution, both in respect to the lateral as well as
 the vertical dimension. Pb isotope ratios clearly identify that heavy metal
 contributions to the soil represent the legacy of former Pb-Zn mining and
 smelting in the area. Depending upon soil properties, differences in the
 intensity of the vertical penetration of heavy metal pollution are
 discernible. Top soil coverage by local farmers provides little remediation.
 Consequently, hazardous conditions for the regional ecology, for agricultural
 usage and ultimately for human health remain in place. Based on chemical and
 isotopic results obtained, more effective remediation strategies need to be
 developed.",
