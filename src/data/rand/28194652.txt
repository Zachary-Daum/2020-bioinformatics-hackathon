    abstract "PURPOSE: Hair cortisol evaluation has been used to help detect
 patients with suspected Cushing syndrome. Our goal was to correlate segmental
 hair cortisol with biochemical testing in patients with Cushing syndrome and
 controls. This study was a prospective analysis of hair cortisol in confirmed
 Cushing syndrome cases over 16 months. METHODS: Thirty-six subjects (26.5 +/-
 18.9 years, 75% female, and 75% Caucasian) were analyzed by diurnal serum
 cortisol, 24 h urinary free cortisol corrected for body surface area
 (UFC/BSA), and 24 h urinary 17-hydroxysteroids corrected for creatinine
 (17OHS/Cr). Thirty patients were diagnosed with Cushing syndrome, and six
 were defined as controls. 3-cm hair samples nearest to the scalp, cut into
 1-cm segments (proximal, medial, and distal), were analyzed for cortisol by
 enzyme immunoassay and measured as pmol cortisol/g dry hair. Hair cortisol
 levels were compared with laboratory testing done within previous 2 months of
 the evaluation. RESULTS: Proximal hair cortisol was higher in Cushing
 syndrome patients (266.6 +/- 738.4 pmol/g) than control patients (38.9 +/-
 25.3 pmol/g) (p = 0.003). Proximal hair cortisol was highest of all segments
 in 25/36 (69%) patients. Among all subjects, proximal hair cortisol was
 strongly correlated with UFC/BSA (r = 0.5, p = 0.005), midnight serum
 cortisol (r = 0.4, p = 0.03), and 17OHS/Cr, which trended towards
 significance (r = 0.3, p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Among the three examined hair
 segments, proximal hair contained the highest cortisol levels and correlated
 the most with the initial biochemical tests for Cushing syndrome in our
 study. Further studies are needed to validate proximal hair cortisol in the
 diagnostic workup for Cushing syndrome.",
