    abstract "The basis of craniofacial tumor surgery is complete surgical
 extirpation, preferably en bloc or with free borders. Craniofacial techniques
 are the gold standard and primary strategies in the treatment of anterior
 skull base tumors. In the last decade, the reports favoring results of
 endoscopic techniques have increased. One could conclude that the classical
 transfacial approaches might become useless, but, in fact, there is little
 research comparing these techniques.In this article, the authors present
 their experience with combined craniofacial resection of anterior
 craniofacial skull base tumors in 9 consecutive patients between January 2013
 and July 2015. This article aims to review some of the traditional
 transfacial approaches, illustrating them with this series of surgical
 patients. Benefits and drawbacks of these approaches are discussed.",
