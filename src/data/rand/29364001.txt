    abstract "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to correlate
 informant personality change (PC) judgements following moderate-severe
 traumatic brain injury with quantitative neurobehavioural measures and to
 contrast the neurobehavioural correlates of informant and participant
 judgements of PC. PARTICIPANTS: Informant-participant pairs were recruited
 from a medico-legal clinic passing effort tests (N = 31) and a National
 Health Service clinic (N = 40). MEASURES: Participants were assessed on
 Wechsler tests of general ability, tests of executive functioning (Zoo Map
 and Fluency) and emotional distress (Beck Depression Inventory-FastScreen,
 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and State-Trait Anger Expression
 Inventory-II). Informants' expressed emotion towards participants was
 assessed with the family questionnaire. Both completed the DEX, the Frontal
 and Social Behavior Questionnaire and PC ratings. RESULTS: The correlates of
 participant and informant ratings of participant PC partially overlapped. For
 example, participant self-reported PC was associated with self-reported
 dysexecutive symptoms and emotional distress. In contrast, informant report
 of participant PC was associated with lower perceived emotional recognition
 and empathy, informant report of dysexecutive symptoms and high informant
 expressed emotion. CONCLUSIONS: It is argued that whilst researchers aim to
 exhaustively quantify specific neurobehavioural changes and their clusters,
 partially overlapping subsets of these changes evoke the PC judgements of
 participants and informants. The clinical implications of this are briefly
 considered.",
