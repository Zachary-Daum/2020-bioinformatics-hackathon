    abstract "PURPOSE: The decreased placental perfusion is the underlying
 reason for intrauterine growth restriction that in turn leads to reduced
 placental perfusion and ischemia. However, there are several issues to be
 understood in the pathophysiology of intrauterine growth restriction. We
 aimed to study whether any compensatory response in placental vascular bed
 occur in pregnancies complicated with intrauterine growth restriction by the
 immunohistochemical staining of von Willebrand factor and caldesmon in
 placental tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 103 pregnant women was
 enrolled in the study including 50 patients who were complicated with IUGR
 and 50 uncomplicated control patients. The study was designed in a
 prospective manner. All placentas were also stained with von Willebrand
 factor and caldesmon monoclonal kits. RESULTS: The immunohistochemical
 staining of von Willebrand factor and caldesmon expressions in placental
 tissues were different between normal and intrauterine growth restriction
 group. The percentages of 2+ and 3+ von Willebrand factor expression were
 higher in the intrauterine growth restriction group comparing with the normal
 group, although the difference was not statistically significant. The
 intensity of caldesmon expression was significantly lower in the intrauterine
 growth restriction group in comparison with the normal group (p < .001).
 CONCLUSION: Angiogenesis occurs as a placental response to intrauterine
 growth restriction which is a hypoxic condition. But newly formed vessels are
 immature and not strong enough. Our study is important to clarify the
 pathophysiology and placental compensatory responses in intrauterine growth
 restriction.",
