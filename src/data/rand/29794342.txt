    abstract "OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural
 network (CNN)-based deep learning architecture for multiclass classification
 of obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea (OSAH) using single-lead
 electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. OSAH is the most common sleep-related
 breathing disorder. Many subjects who suffer from OSAH remain undiagnosed;
 thus, early detection of OSAH is important. APPROACH: In this study,
 automatic classification of three classes-normal, hypopnea, and apnea-based
 on a CNN is performed. An optimal six-layer CNN model is trained on a
 training dataset (45 096 events) and evaluated on a test dataset (11 274
 events). The training set (69 subjects) and test set (17 subjects) were
 collected from 86 subjects with length of approximately 6 h and segmented
 into 10 s durations. MAIN RESULTS: The proposed CNN model reaches a mean
 [Formula: see text]-score of 93.0 for the training dataset and 87.0 for the
 test dataset. SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, proposed deep learning architecture
 achieved a high performance for multiclass classification of OSAH using
 single-lead ECG recordings. The proposed method can be employed in screening
 of patients suspected of having OSAH.",
