    abstract "Fulani and Masaleit are two sympatric ethnic groups in western
 Sudan who are characterised by marked differences in susceptibility to
 Plasmodium falciparum malaria. It has been demonstrated that
 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and Sickle cell trait
 HbAS carriers are protected from the most severe forms of malaria. This study
 aimed to investigate a set of specific IgG subclasses against P. falciparum
 Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA-1 3D7), haemoglobin variants and (G6PD) in
 association with malaria susceptibility among Fulani ethnic group compared to
 sympatric ethnic group living in Western Sudan. A total of 124 children aged
 5-9 years from each tribe living in an area of hyper-endemic P. falciparum
 unstable malaria transmission were recruited and genotyped for the
 haemoglobin (Hb) genes, (G6PD) and (ABO) blood groups. Furthermore, the level
 of plasma IgG antibody subclasses against P. falciparum antigen (AMA-1) were
 measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Higher levels of
 anti-malarial IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 but not IgG4 antibody were found in Fulani
 when compared to Masaleit. Individuals carrying the HbCC phenotype were
 significantly associated with higher levels of IgG1 and IgG2. Furthermore,
 individuals having the HbAS phenotype were associated with higher levels of
 specific IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies. In addition, patients with G6PD A/A
 genotype were associated with higher levels of specific IgG2 antibody
 compared with those carrying the A/G and G/G genotypes. The results indicate
 that the Fulani ethnic group show lower frequency of HbAS, HbSS and HbAC
 compared to the Masaleit ethnic group. The inter-ethnic analysis shows no
 statistically significant difference in G6PD genotypes (P value=0.791).
 However, the intra-ethnic analysis indicates that both ethnic groups have
 less A/A genotypes and (A) allele frequency of G6PD compared to G/G
 genotypes, while the HbSA genotype was associated with higher levels of IgG2
 (AMA-1) and IgG4 antibodies. In addition, patients carrying the G6PD A/A
 genotype were associated with higher levels of specific IgG2 antibody
 compared with those carrying the A/G and G/G genotypes. The present results
 revealed that the Fulani ethnic group has statistically significantly lower
 frequency of abnormal haemoglobin resistant to malaria infection compared to
 the Masaleit ethnic group.",
