    abstract "The use of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnancy has been
 debated but evidence suggests that it is safer than smoking. A
 cross-sectional survey was conducted with: (i) general practitioners and
 obstetricians from a college database; and (ii) general practitioners with a
 special interest in Indigenous health. General practitioners had higher odds
 of prescribing compared to obstetricians. Reading guidelines, confidence,
 viewing nicotine replacement therapy as safe, effective and with good
 adherence, also significantly increased the odds of prescription. Clear
 guidance regarding safety and efficacy, with practical clinical protocols,
 are required in order to reduce variation in prescribing rates across these
 clinicians.",
