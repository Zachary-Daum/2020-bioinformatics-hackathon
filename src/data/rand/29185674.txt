    abstract "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) is
 effective in the treatment of calcific tendinopathy of the rotator cuff,
 eliciting an analgesic/anti-inflammatory action and promoting tissue
 regeneration. Kinesio taping (KT), another recently-introduced rehabilitative
 tool, exerts an analgesic and biomechanical action on joints and muscles.
 ESWT and KT may have a synergic effect when used in combination, but the
 effectiveness of the association has not been established. AIM: The aim of
 this study was to test if the association of KT with ESWT is superior to ESWT
 alone in the treatment of rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy. DESIGN:
 Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Rehabilitation Institute outpatients.
 POPULATION: Forty-two patients with rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy were
 randomly assigned to the experimental group (ESWT+KT, N.=21) or control
 (ESWT, N.=21). METHODS: In the experimental group, patients underwent three
 sessions (once a week for 3 weeks) of ESWT with KT applied at the end of each
 session. Controls underwent three sessions of ESWT only. All patients were
 assessed before treatment (T0) and at 1 (T1), 4 (T2) and 12 weeks (T3) after
 the end of treatment with the following outcome measures: a visual analogue
 scale (VAS), the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)
 questionnaire, Subjective Shoulder Rating Questionnaire (SSRQ), and Oxford
 Shoulder Score (OSS). RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvement in
 all outcome measures, but the time course differed between the two groups. At
 T1 vs. T0, the improvement was significantly better in ESWT+KT than ESWT on
 VAS (P=0.007), DASH (P<0.0001) and SSRQ (P=0.0001). Successive improvements
 at T2 vs. T1 and T3 vs. T2 did not differ significantly between the groups.
 At the end of follow-up, ESWT+KT still showed significantly greater
 improvement than ESWT on VAS (P=0.02) and SSRQ (P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: KT
 associated with ESWT seems to improve the recovery in rotator cuff calcific
 tendinopathy with a faster therapeutic response compared to ESWT only.
 CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Our results suggest the effectiveness of
 using KT as adjuvant therapy to ESWT in rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy,
 through enhancing the short-term analgesic action and the medium- to
 long-term biological-regenerative effects.",
