    abstract "Polymer-stabilized liquid crystal (PSLC) devices comprise a
 polymer matrix in an otherwise continuous phase of liquid crystal. The
 fibrils of the polymer provide, even in the bulk, virtual surfaces with
 finite anchoring energy resulting in attractive electro-optic properties.
 Here, we describe a novel variation of the PSLC device fabricated by
 reinforcing the polymer matrix with polymer-capped single-walled carbon
 nanotubes (CNTs). The most important outcome of this strengthening of the
 polymer strands is that the threshold voltage associated with the
 electro-optic switching becomes essentially temperature independent in marked
 contrast to the significant thermal variation seen in the absence of the
 nanotubes. The reinforcement reduces the magnitude of the threshold voltage,
 and notably accelerates the switching dynamics and the effective splay
 elasticity. Each of these attributes is quite attractive from the device
 operation point of view, especially the circuit design of the required
 drivers. The amelioration is caused by the polymer decorating CNTs being
 structurally identical to that of the matrix. The resulting good
 compatibility between CNTs and the matrix prevents the CNTs from drifting
 away from the matrix polymer, a lacuna in previous attempts to have CNTs in
 PSLC systems. The difference in the morphology, perhaps the primary cause for
 the effects seen, is noted in the electron microscopy images of the films.",
