    abstract "Direct primary care is a promising, market-based alternative to
 the fee-for-service payment structure that shapes doctor-patient
 relationships in America. Instead of billing patients and insurers service by
 service, direct primary care doctors charge their patients a periodic,
 prenegotiated fee in exchange for providing a wide range of healthcare
 services and increased availability compared to traditional practices. This 
""subscription"" model is intended to eliminate the administrative burdens
 associated with insurer interaction, which, in theory, allows doctors to
 spend more time with their patients and less time doing paperwork. Direct
 practices have become increasingly popular since Congress passed the
 Affordable Care Act (ACA). This growth has been driven by legislation in
 several states that resolves a number of legal questions that slowed the
 model's growth and by the ACA's recognition of the model as a permissible way
 to cover primary care in ""approved"" health plans. Yet legal scholars have
 hardly focused on direct primary care. Given the model's growth, however, the
 time is ripe for a more focused legal inquiry. This Note begins that inquiry.
 After tracing the model's evolution and its core components, this Note
 substantively examines the laws in states that regulate direct practices and
 analyzes how those laws address a number of potential policy concerns. It
 then analyzes direct primary care's broader role in the contemporary American
 healthcare marketplace. Based upon that analysis, this Note concludes that
 direct primary care is a beneficial innovation that harmonizes well with a
 cooperative-federalism-based healthcare policy model.",
