    abstract "OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this article are to increase
 understanding of the concepts of theranostics and peptide receptor
 radionuclide therapy (PRRT) as they apply to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs);
 review the key 1, 2, and 3 clinical trial data leading to the approval of
 (177)Lu-tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid-octreotide ((177)Lu-DOTATATE);
 and foster understanding of the practical aspects and future directions of
 PRRT for NETs. CONCLUSION: In January 2018, (177)Lu-DOTATATE therapy was
 approved in the United States (previously approved in Europe in September
 2017) for adult patients with somatostatin receptor-positive
 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, including those of the foregut,
 midgut, and hindgut. The results of the phase 3 Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy
 (NETTER-1) trial show favorable outcomes with respect to the primary endpoint
 of progression-free survival and a host of secondary objectives, including
 overall survival, objective response rate, and quality of life measures.
 Patient selection is based on a number of specific factors and should be
 sequenced carefully with respect to other available therapies, ideally in
 multidisciplinary cancer conferences. Establishing the therapy at a new
 institution can be somewhat involved, but once it is established, the therapy
 is fairly straightforward to administer and is well tolerated with limited
 side-effects and toxicity. A number of approaches and issues are still to be
 worked out, and this therapy will continue to be studied and optimized.",
