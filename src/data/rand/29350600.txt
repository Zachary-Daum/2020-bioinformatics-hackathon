    abstract "OBJECTIVE Meige syndrome is characterized by blepharospasm and
 varied subphenotypes of craniocervical dystonia. Current literature on
 pallidal surgery for Meige syndrome is limited to case reports and a few
 small-scale studies. The authors investigated the clinical outcomes of deep
 brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in patients
 with Meige syndrome. METHODS Sixteen patients who underwent GPi DBS at the
 Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2015 were included
 in this study. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) movement
 subscale (BFMDRS-M) scores (range 0-120) obtained at the following 3 time
 points were included in this analysis: before surgery, 3 months after
 surgery, and at the most recent follow-up evaluation. RESULTS The patients'
 mean age (+/- SD) at symptom onset was 46.7 +/- 10.1 years, and the mean
 disease duration at the time of the authors' initial evaluation was 5.9 +/-
 4.1 years. In 12 patients, the initial symptom was blepharospasm, and the
 other 4 patients presented with cervical dystonia. The mean postoperative
 follow-up period was 66.6 +/- 40.7 months (range 13-150 months). The mean
 total BFMDRS-M scores at the 3 time points were 16.3 +/- 5.5, 5.5 +/- 5.6
 (66.3% improvement, p < 0.001), and 6.7 +/- 7.3 (58.9% improvement, p <
 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The results indicate long-term efficacy for GPi DBS for
 the majority of patients with Meige syndrome.",
