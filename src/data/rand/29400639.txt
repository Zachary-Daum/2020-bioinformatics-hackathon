    abstract "The present research examined the link between passion displayed
 by team members during the singing of national anthems at UEFA Euro 2016 and
 team performance in the tournaments' 51 games. Drawing on social identity
 theorising, we hypothesised a positive relationship between passion and
 performance. Consistent with this hypothesis, results showed that teams that
 sang national anthems with greater passion went on to concede fewer goals.
 Moreover, results provided evidence that the impact of passion on the
 likelihood of winning a game depended on the stage of the competition: in the
 knockout stage (but not the group stage) greater passion was associated with
 a greater likelihood of victory. Extending recent reviews that highlight the
 importance of social identity processes in sporting contexts, these results
 suggest that team members' identity-based expression of passion for the
 collective can be an important predictor of subsequent performance.",
