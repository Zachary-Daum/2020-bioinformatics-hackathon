    abstract "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Reward processing and working memory
 (WM) underlie value-based decision-making; consequently, joint examination of
 these systems may further our understanding of why smokers choose to smoke
 again following a quit attempt (relapse). While previous studies have
 demonstrated altered reward and WM function associated with nicotine
 exposure, little is known about the effects of abstinence on the joint
 function of these systems. The current study aims to address this gap.
 METHOD: Eighteen daily smokers were tested on a monetarily incentivized
 memory guided saccade (MGS) task on two separate, counterbalanced occasions,
 an abstinent and a non-abstinent session. The MGS task is a widely used
 metric of spatial working memory and enables precise quantification of the
 effects of rewards and nicotine exposure on behavior. RESULTS: During the
 non-abstinent session, participants showed increased accuracy of the initial
 saccade towards the remembered target location on reward vs. neutral trials.
 Participants also showed increased accuracy of the final saccade towards the
 target, across incentive types, only during the non-abstinent condition.
 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our observation that rewards improve the accuracy
 of the initial memory guided saccade during the non-abstinent but not
 abstinent condition extends a growing literature indicating reduced
 motivation towards monetary rewards during abstinence. Further, differences
 in the accuracy of the final corrective saccade during the non-abstinent but
 not the abstinent condition suggests smoking abstinence-related effects on WM
 precision beyond those related to incentive motivation (e.g., sustained
 attention). SIGNIFICANCE: This work extends our fundamental understanding of
 smoking's effects on core affective and cognitive processes.",
