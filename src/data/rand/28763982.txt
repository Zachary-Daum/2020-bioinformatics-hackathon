    abstract "This study aimed to improve the sensorial quality of sourdough
 wheat bread by the addition of cell-free enzyme extracts (CFEs) from
 Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (SF), Hafnia alvei (HF) and Debaryomyces
 hansenii (DH). CFEs were suitable sources of peptidases, glutamate
 dehydrogenase and cystathionine gamma-lyase. The concentration of free amino
 acids (FAA) in the sourdoughs containing CFEs was higher than the control
 sourdough, produced without addition of CFEs. The community-level catabolic
 profiles showed that the highest number of carbohydrates, polymers and
 carboxylic acids were consumed in the SF sourdough. Breads produced with CFEs
 were characterized by higher specific volume than the control. The use of
 CFEs impacted on the profile of volatile organic compounds. Overall, positive
 correlations were found between some key-aroma compounds and enzyme
 activities/precursor FAA. The SF bread, characterized by highest level of
 alcohols, received the highest score for aroma and sweetness in the sensory
 analysis.",
