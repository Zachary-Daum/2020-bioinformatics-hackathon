    abstract "We used the antibody grafting technology to prepare anti-hCG
 single-domain antibodies on the basis of antigen-binding peptide to simplify
 the single-domain antibody preparation process and improving the biochemical
 stability of peptide. By using a universal single-domain antibody backbone
 (cAbBCII10), CDR1 or CDR3 was replaced by the hCG-binding peptide, and the
 grafted antibody gene sequences were synthesized and cloned into the
 prokaryotic expression vector pET30a(+) in fusion with a C-terminal sfGFP
 gene, i.e. pET30a-(His6)-cAbBCII10-CDR1/hCGBP1-sfGFP and
 pET30a-(His6)-cAbBCII10-CDR3/hCGBP3-sfGFP. The recombinant plasmids were
 transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the fusion proteins were induced by
 IPTG. Highly soluble recombinant fusion proteins were obtained and purified
 by Ni-NTA affinity column. SDS-PAGE confirmed the purified protein as the
 target protein. The antigen-antibody binding assay showed that both the CDR1
 and CDR3 grafted antibodies have hCG-binding activities. While the titers of
 the two grafted antibodies were similar, the binding affinity of CDR3 grafted
 antibody was higher than that of CDR1 grafted protein (about 2-3 times). The
 grafted antibodies retained the relatively high biochemical stability of the
 single-domain antibody backbone and were relatively thermostable and alkaline
 tolerant. The obtained antibodies also had a relatively high antigen-binding
 specificity to hCG. This study provided a reliable experimental basis for
 further optimization of anti-hCG single domain antibody by antibody grafting
 technology using antigen-binding peptide.",
