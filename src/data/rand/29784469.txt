    abstract "In 2009, Bio-Manguinhos conducted a dose-response study with the
 yellow fever vaccine, administering the vaccine in the usual mean dose of
 27,476IU (full dose, reference) and in tapered doses (10,447IU, 3013IU,
 587IU, 158IU, and 31IU) by the usual subcutaneous route and usual volume
 (0.5mL). Tapered doses were obtained by dilution in the manufacturer's
 laboratory, and the test batches presented industrial quality. Doses down to
 587IU showed similar immunogenicity to the full dose (27,476, reference),
 while the 158IU and 31IU doses displayed lower immunogenicity. Seropositivity
 was maintained at 10months, except in the group that received the 31IU dose.
 The current study aims to determine whether yellow fever seropositivity was
 maintained eight years after YF vaccination in non-revaccinated individuals.
 According to the current study's results, seropositivity was maintained in
 85% of 318 participants and was similar across groups. The findings support
 the use of the yellow fever vaccine in fractional doses during outbreaks, but
 each fractional dose should have at least 587IU. This study also supports the
 minimum dose required by WHO, 1000IU. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION:
