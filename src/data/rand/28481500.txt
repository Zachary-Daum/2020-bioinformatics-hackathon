    abstract "A novel single-cell analysis platform was fabricated using
 solid-state zinc-coadsorbed carbon quantum dot (ZnCQDs) nanocomposites as an
 electrochemiluminescence (ECL) probe for the detection of breast cancer cells
 and evaluation of the CD44 expression level. Solid-state ZnCQDs nanocomposite
 probes were constructed through the attachment of ZnCQDs to gold
 nanoparticles and then the loading of magnetic beads to amplify the ECL
 signal, exhibiting a remarkable 120-fold enhancement of the ECL intensity.
 Hyaluronic acid (HA)-functionalized solid-state probes were used to label a
 single breast cancer cell by the specific recognition of HA with CD44 on the
 cell surface, revealing more stable, sensitive, and effective tagging in
 comparison with the water-soluble CQDs. This strategy exhibited a good
 analytical performance for the analysis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 single cells
 with linear range from 1 to 18 and from 1 to 12 cells, respectively.
 Furthermore, this single-cell analysis platform was used for evaluation of
 the CD44 expression level of these two cell lines, in which the MDA-MB-231
 cells revealed a 2.8-5.2-fold higher CD44 expression level. A total of 20
 single cells were analyzed individually, and the distributions of the ECL
 intensity revealed larger variations, indicating the high cellular
 heterogeneity of the CD44 expression level on the same cell line. The
 as-proposed single-cell analysis platform might provide a novel protocol to
 effectively study the individual cellular function and cellular heterogeneity.",
