    abstract "The differentiation of roots of agricultural species is desired
 for a deeper understanding of the belowground root interaction which helps to
 understand the complex interaction in intercropping and crop-weed systems.
 The roots can be reliably differentiated via Fourier transform infrared
 spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR). In two replicated
 greenhouse experiments, six pea cultivars, five oat cultivars as well as
 seven maize cultivars and five barnyard grass proveniences (n = 10
 plants/cultivar or provenience) were grown under controlled conditions. One
 root of each plant was harvested and five different root segments of each
 root were separated, dried and measured with FTIR-ATR spectroscopy. The
 results showed that, firstly, the root spectra of single pea and single oat
 cultivars as well as single maize and single barnyard grass
 cultivars/proveniences separated species-specific in cluster analyses. In the
 majority of cases the species separation was correct, but in a few cases, the
 spectra of the root tips had to be omitted to ensure the precise separation
 between the species. Therefore, species differentiation is possible
 regardless of the cultivar or provenience. Consequently, all tested cultivars
 of pea and oat spectra were analyzed together and separated within a cluster
 analysis according to their affiliated species. The same result was found in
 a cluster analysis with maize and barnyard grass spectra. Secondly, a cluster
 analysis with all species (pea, oat, maize and barnyard grass) was performed.
 The species split up species-specific and formed a dicotyledonous pea cluster
 and a monocotyledonous cluster subdivided in oat, maize and barnyard grass
 subclusters. Thirdly, cultivar or provenience differentiations within one
 species were possible in one of the two replicated experiments. But these
 separations were less resilient.",
