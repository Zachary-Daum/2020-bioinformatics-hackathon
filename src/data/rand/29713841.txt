    abstract "Pseudo-acanthosis nigricans is a common dermatological disorder
 that is usually difficult to treat secondary to maceration of the skin from
 excessive sweating, obesity, or associated with endocrine disorders.
 Fractional photothermolysis and chemical peeling have been reported to
 improve the condition. To determine whether fractional CO2 laser resurfacing
 or glycolic acid peel is more effective and safe option for therapy. Twenty
 Egyptian patients were included in the study where each patient was subjected
 to three sessions of both fractional CO2 on the right side of the neck and
 glycolic acid peel 70% on the left side of the neck. All patients were
 evaluated by a scoring system Acanthosis Nigricans Area and Severity Index
 (ANASI) score and three blinded dermatologists before and after treatment.
 Clinical improvement on the side treated by glycolic acid peel showed 43%
 improvement while the side treated by fractional CO2 showed 19% improvement.
 Glycolic acid peel shows superior results to fractional CO2 due to
 accelerated induced exfoliation, yet still fractional CO2 results are
 promising due to a presumably long-term improvement of skin texture.",
