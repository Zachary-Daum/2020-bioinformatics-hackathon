    abstract "BACKGROUND: Chronic opioid therapy-clinical reminder (COT-CR) is
 a decision support tool to prompt providers to carefully assess patients
 prescribed chronic opioids. This tool was developed to address inappropriate
 opioid prescribing. OBJECTIVE: To determine COT-CR's impact on reducing
 morphine equivalent monthly dose (MEMD) and risk index for overdose or
 serious prescription opioid-induced respiratory depression (RIOSORD) values
 in veterans receiving chronic opioids. METHODS: This retrospective cohort
 review matched patients with a complete COT-CR to patients with an incomplete
 COT-CR using propensity scores. In the primary aim, an interrupted time
 series design evaluated for changes in MEMD 12 months before and 6 months
 after the index date. The index date was the first pain or primary care
 provider visit post COT-CR installation. In the secondary aims, a
 retrospective cohort design was used to evaluate the changes in RIOSORD index
 score and risk class 6 months after the index date. RESULTS: After matching,
 3801 patients were included in the complete and incomplete COT-CR groups,
 respectively. Greater average reduction in MEMD (-11.6 MEMD; 95% CI = -0.97
 to -22.25 MEMD; P = 0.032) and RIOSORD index score (-0.53 RIOSORD index
 score; 95% CI = -1.00, -0.05 RIOSORD index score; P = 0.030) was observed in
 patients with a complete COT-CR compared to patients with an incomplete
 COT-CR. Differences in RIOSORD risk class were insignificant. CONCLUSION:
 Completing the COT-CR was associated with reduced MEMD and RIOSORD values.
 This suggests that active monitoring can change prescribing patterns,
 thereby, reducing the overall risk of opioid overdose in at-risk veterans.",
