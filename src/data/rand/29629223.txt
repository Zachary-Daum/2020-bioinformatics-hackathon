    abstract "Purpose: Early detection of gastric cancer is important to
 improve prognosis. Early detection enables local treatment, such as
 endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Therefore, we investigated whether
 early detection of gastric cancer could reduce healthcare costs by comparison
 according to stage and treatment modalities. Materials and Methods: Medical
 care costs were investigated according to tumor stage and initial treatment
 modality in 1,188 patients newly diagnosed with gastric cancer at 7 medical
 institutions from December 2011 to June 2012. Total medical care costs during
 the first-year after diagnosis (total first-year costs) were examined,
 including the costs of initial treatment, post-initial treatment, and
 inpatient and outpatient visits. Results: Stage I (75.3%) was the most common
 cancer stage. ESD was the second most common treatment following surgery.
 Total first-year costs increased significantly from stages I to IV. The costs
 of initial treatment and post-initial treatment were lowest in patients with
 stage I cancer. Among patients with stage I cancer, total first-year costs
 were significantly lower when treated by ESD; in particular, initial ESD
 treatment costs were much lower than others. Conclusions: The cost of
 healthcare has increased significantly with increasing cancer stages. ESD can
 greatly reduce medical care costs of gastric cancer. Thus, early detection of
 gastric cancer is important to reduce healthcare costs.",
