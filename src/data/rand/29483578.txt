    abstract "Targeted therapy has held promise to be a successful anticancer
 treatment due to its specificity towards tumor cells that express the target
 receptors. However, not all targeting drugs used in the clinic are equally
 effective in tumor eradication. To examine which biochemical and biophysical
 properties of targeted agents are pivotal for their effective distribution
 inside the tumor and their efficient cellular uptake, we combine mathematical
 micro-pharmacological modeling with in vivo imaging of targeted human
 xenograft tumors in SCID mice. The mathematical model calibrated to
 experimental data was used to explore properties of the targeting ligand
 (diffusion and affinity) and ligand release schemes (rates and
 concentrations) with a goal to identify the properties of cells and ligands
 that enable high receptor saturation. By accounting for heterogeneities
 typical of in vivo tumors, our model was able to identify cell- and
 tissue-level barriers to efficient drug uptake. This work provides a base for
 utilizing experimentally measurable properties of a ligand-targeted agent and
 patient-specific attributes of the tumor tissue to support the development of
 novel targeted imaging agents and for improvement in their delivery to
 individual tumor cells.",
