    abstract "Crying is often considered to be a positive experience that
 benefits the crier, yet there is little empirical evidence to support this.
 Indeed, it seems that people hold a range of appraisals about their crying,
 and these are likely to influence the effects of crying on their emotional
 state. This paper reports on the development and psychometric validation of
 the Beliefs about Crying Scale (BACS), a new measure assessing beliefs about
 whether crying leads to positive or negative emotional outcomes in individual
 and interpersonal contexts. Using 40 preliminary items drawn from a
 qualitative study, an exploratory factor analysis with 202 participants (50%
 female; aged 18-84 years) yielded three subscales: Helpful Beliefs,
 Unhelpful-Individual Beliefs, and Unhelpful-Social Beliefs, explaining 60% of
 the variance in the data. Confirmatory factor analysis on the 14-item scale
 with 210 participants (71% female; aged 17-48 years) showed a good fit to the
 three factors. The subscales showed differential relationships with measures
 of personality traits, crying proneness, emotion regulation and expressivity,
 and emotional identification (alexithymia). The BACS provides a nuanced
 understanding of beliefs about crying in different contexts and helps to
 explain why crying behaviour may not always represent positive emotion
 regulation for the crier.",
