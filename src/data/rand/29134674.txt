    abstract "PURPOSE: The purpose of this work is to evaluate the performance
 of dual-energy CT (DECT) for determining proton stopping power ratios (SPRs)
 in an experimental environment and to demonstrate its potential advantages
 over conventional single-energy CT (SECT) in clinical conditions. METHODS:
 Water equivalent range (WER) measurements of 12 tissue-equivalent plastic
 materials and 12 fresh animal tissue samples are performed in a 195 MeV broad
 proton beam using the dose extinction method. SECT and DECT scans of the
 samples are performed with a dual-source CT scanner (Siemens SOMATOM
 Definition Flash). The methods of Schneider et al. (1996), Bourque et al.
 (2014), and Lalonde et al. (2017) are used to predict proton SPR on SECT and
 DECT images. From predicted SPR values, the WER of the proton beam through
 the sample is predicted for SECT and DECT using Monte Carlo simulations and
 compared to the measured WER. RESULTS: For homogeneous tissue-equivalent
 plastic materials, results with DECT are consistent with experimental
 measurements and show a systematic reduction of SPR uncertainty compared to
 SECT, with root-mean-square errors of 1.59% versus 0.61% for SECT and DECT,
 respectively. Measurements with heterogeneous animal samples show a clear
 reduction of the bias on range predictions in the presence of bones, with
 -0.88% for SECT versus -0.58% and -0.14% for both DECT methods. An
 uncertainty budget allows isolating the effect of CT number conversion to SPR
 and predicts improvements by DECT over SECT consistently with theoretical
 predictions, with 0.34% and 0.31% for soft tissues and bones in the
 experimental setup compared to 0.34% and 1.14% with the theoretical method.
 CONCLUSIONS: The present work uses experimental measurements in a realistic
 clinical environment to show potential benefits of DECT for proton therapy
 treatment planning. Our results show clear improvements over SECT in
 tissue-equivalent plastic materials and animal tissues. Further work towards
 using Monte Carlo simulations for treatment planning with DECT data and a
 more detailed investigation of the uncertainties on I-value and limitations
 on the Bragg additivity rule could potentially further enhance the benefits
 of this imaging technology for proton therapy.",
