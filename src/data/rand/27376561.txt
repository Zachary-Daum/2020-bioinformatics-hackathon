    abstract "Acellular biologic scaffolds derived from extracellular matrix
 have been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies as a regenerative
 medicine approach for volumetric muscle loss treatment. The present
 manuscript provides a review of previous studies supporting the use of
 extracellular matrix derived biologic scaffolds for the promotion of
 functional skeletal muscle tissue formation that is contractile and
 innervated. The manuscript also identifies key mechanisms that have been
 associated with ECM-mediated skeletal muscle repair, and provides hypotheses
 as to why there have been variable outcomes, ranging from successful to
 unsatisfactory, associated with ECM bioscaffold implantation in the skeletal
 muscle injury microenvironment.",
