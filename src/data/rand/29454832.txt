    abstract "IKK (inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase) is the critical regulator
 for NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) pathway against pathogenic invasion in
 vertebrates or invertebrates. However, the IKK from crab species has not yet
 been identified. In the present study, three full-length cDNA sequences of
 IKKs from mud crab Scylla paramamosain, designated as SpIKKbeta,
 SpIKKepsilon1 and SpIKKepsilon2, were firstly cloned through RT-PCR and RACE
 methods. This is also the first report about the identification of two
 IKKepsilon genes in mud crab and even in crustaceans. The SpIKKbeta cDNA was
 2824 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 2382 bp, which encoded
 a putative protein of 793 amino acids (aa). The ORF of two SpIKKepsilon
 isoforms, SpIKKepsilon1 and SpIKKepsilon2, were 2400 bp and 2331 bp in length
 encoding 799 aa and 776 aa, respectively. The crucial conserved residues and
 functional domains, including the kinase domains (KDs) and leucine zipper
 (LZ), were identified in all SpIKKs. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that
 SpIKKbeta was classified into the IKKs class while SpIKKepsilons could be
 grouped into the IKK-related kinases class. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that
 three SpIKKs were constitutively expressed in all tested tissues and the
 highest expression levels of SpIKKbeta and SpIKKepsilons were all in
 hemocyte. The gene expression profiles of SpIKKs were distinct when crabs
 suffered biotic and abiotic stresses including the exposures of Vibrio
 alginolyticus, poly (I:C), cadmium and air exposure, suggesting that the
 SpIKKs might play different roles in response to pathogens infections, heavy
 metal and air exposure. Moreover, IKKs from mud crab can significantly
 activate mammalian NF-kappaB pathway, suggesting the function of IKKs might
 be evolutionally well-conserved. Results of the RNAi experiments suggested
 that SpIKKs might regulate the immune signaling pathway when hemocytes were
 challenged with V. parahemolyticus or virus-analog poly (I:C). All of these
 results indicated that the obtained SpIKKs might be involved in stress
 responses against biotic or abiotic stresses, and it also highlighted their
 functional conservation in the innate immune system from crustaceans to
 mammals.",
