    abstract "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the diagnosis and treatment of
 prosthetic joint infection (PJI) with a focus on two-stage revision
 arthroplasty. The text will discuss different spacer constructs in total knee
 and total hip arthroplasty and will present clinical outcome data for these
 various options. RECENT FINDINGS: There is no appreciable difference in
 infection eradication between mobile and static antibiotic spacers. Mobile
 spacers have shown improved knee range of motion after second-stage
 re-implantation. Two-stage revision arthroplasty is the gold standard
 treatment for PJI. The first stage involves removal of all components,
 cement, and compromised soft tissues with placement of an
 antibiotic-impregnated spacer. Spacer options include both mobile and static
 spacers. Mobile spacers offer maintenance of ambulation and joint range of
 motion between staged procedures and have shown to be as effective in
 eradicating infection as static spacers.",
