    abstract "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency
 characterized by a deficient neutrophil oxidative burst and the inadequate
 killing of microbes, is well known to cause a significantly increased risk of
 invasive infection. However, infectious complications are not the sole
 manifestations of CGD; substantial additional morbidity is driven by
 noninfectious complications also. These complications can include, for
 example, a wide range of inflammatory diseases that affect the
 gastrointestinal tract, lung, skin, and genitourinary tract and overt
 autoimmune disease. These diseases can occur at any age and are especially
 problematic in adolescents and adults with CGD. Many of these noninfectious
 complications present a highly challenging therapeutic conundrum, wherein
 immunosuppression must be balanced against an already markedly increased risk
 of invasive fungal and bacterial infections. In this review, the myriad
 noninfectious complications of CGD are discussed, as are important gaps in
 our understanding of these processes, which warrant further investigation.",
