    abstract "In the present investigations, we evaluate in vitro hepatocyte
 uptake and partitioning for the prediction of in vivo clearance and liver
 partitioning. Monkeys were intravenously co-dosed with rosuvastatin and
 bosentan, substrates of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs),
 and metformin, a substrate of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1). Serial
 plasma and liver samples were collected over time. Liver and plasma unbound
 fraction was determined using equilibrium dialysis. In vivo unbound
 partitioning (Kpu,u) for rosuvastatin, bosentan, and metformin, calculated
 from total concentrations in the liver and plasma, were 243, 553, and 15,
 respectively. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic monkey model that
 incorporates active and passive hepatic uptake was developed to fit plasma
 and liver concentrations. In addition, a two-compartment model was used to
 fit in vitro hepatic uptake curves in suspended monkey hepatocyte to
 determine active uptake, passive diffusion, and intracellular unbound
 fraction parameters. At steady-state in the model, in vitro Kpu,u was
 determined. The results demonstrated that in vitro values under-predicted in
 vivo active uptake for rosuvastatin, bosentan, and metformin by 6.7-, 28-,
 and 1.5-fold, respectively, while passive diffusion was over-predicted. In
 vivo Kpu,u values were under-predicted from in vitro data by 30-, 79-, and
 3-fold. In conclusion, active uptake and liver partitioning in monkeys for
 OATP substrates were greatly under-predicted from in vitro hepatocyte uptake,
 while OCT-mediated uptake and partitioning scaled reasonably well from in
 vitro, demonstrating substrate- and transporter-dependent scaling factors.
 The combination of in vitro experimental and modeling approaches proved
 useful for assessing prediction of in vivo intracellular partitioning.",
