    abstract "We present a new numerical model to simulate settling
 trajectories of discretized individual or a mixture of particles of different
 geometrical shapes in a quiescent fluid and their flow trajectories in a
 flowing fluid. Simulations unveiled diverse particle settling trajectories as
 a function of their geometrical shape and density. The effects of the surface
 concavity of a boomerang particle and aspect ratio of a rectangular particle
 on the periodicity and amplitude of oscillations in their settling
 trajectories were numerically captured. Use of surrogate circular particles
 for settling or flowing of a mixture of non-circular particles were shown to
 miscalculate particle velocities by a factor of 0.9-2.2 and inaccurately
 determine the particles' trajectories. In a microfluidic chamber with
 particles of different shapes and sizes, simulations showed that steady
 vortices do not necessarily always control particle entrapments, nor do
 larger particles get selectively and consistently entrapped in steady
 vortices. Strikingly, a change in the shape of large particles from circular
 to elliptical resulted in stronger entrapments of smaller circular particles,
 but enhanced outflows of larger particles, which could be an alternative
 microfluidics-based method for sorting and separation of particles of
 different sizes and shapes.",
