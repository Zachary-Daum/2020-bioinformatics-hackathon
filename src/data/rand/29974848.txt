    abstract "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer and the sixth
 most lethal malignancy in the world. We chose gene expression profile of
 GSE14520 from GEO database aiming to find key genes that affect HCC
 progression. 22 paired tumor and non-tumor samples were included in this
 analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor and non-tumor
 were selected using GEO2R. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and protein-protein
 interaction (PPI) of the DEGs were done using Metascape. There were 357 DEGs,
 including 70 up-regulated genes and 287 down-regulated genes. These DEGs were
 enriched in drug metabolic process, organic acid catabolic process,
 monocarboxylic metabolic process and etc. Three important modules were
 detected from PPI network using Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE)
 algorithm. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier analysis for overall survival and
 disease-free survival were applied to those genes in top PPI group. In
 conclusion, this bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that DEGs, such as
 CYP2C9, might promote the development of HCC, especially in drug metabolism.
 It could also be used as a new biomarker for diagnosis.",
