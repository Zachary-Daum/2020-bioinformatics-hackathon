    abstract "BACKGROUND: An increasing number of CBCT units and a wide
 variability of radiation doses have been reported in dentistry lately. AIM:
 To estimate the effective, cumulative, and organ absorbed doses in children
 exposed to CBCT over 2 years. DESIGN: A prospective study was conducted in
 children who underwent CBCT diagnostic imaging with the ProMax3D machine.
 Organ and effective doses were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation using 5-
 and 8-year-old pediatric voxel phantoms. Extrapolation procedures were
 applied to estimate doses for other ages and CBCT protocols used in clinical
 conditions. RESULTS: The median effective dose was 137.9 muSv, and the median
 cumulative dose was 231.4 muSv. Statistically significant differences in the
 effective doses and cumulative doses were found for various indications of
 CBCT in children (P < 0.001). The median absorbed organ dose for brain and
 thyroid was significantly higher for the clinical condition that required
 large FOVs (2.5 mGy and 1.05 mGy, respectively) compared to medium (0.19 and
 0.51 mGy) and small FOVs (0.07 and 0.24 mGy; P < 0.05). The radiation dose of
 salivary glands did not vary significantly with FOV. CONCLUSION: The results
 revealed the variation of CBCT doses and the influence of FOV size in
 pediatric exposure.",
