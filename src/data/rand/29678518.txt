    abstract "Neuroinflammation is a common pathogenic mechanism for a number
 of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
 diseases. Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, contribute to the onset
 and progression of the neuroinflammation observed in these diseases.
 Microglia become activated and initiate an inflammatory response by
 interacting with a diverse set of molecules, including the group of
 endogenous proteins released upon cell damage, termed damage-associated
 molecular patterns (DAMPs). One of these molecules, mitochondrial
 transcription factor A (TFAM), has been shown to induce pro-inflammatory and
 cytotoxic responses of microglia in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that TFAM
 injected into the cisterna magna of male Sprague-Dawley rats upregulates (i)
 the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, interleukin
 (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and nuclear factor-kappa
 B inhibitor alpha (NF-kappaBIA) in the hippocampus; (ii) the expression of
 MCP-1, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in the frontal cortex; and (iii) IL-1beta
 protein concentration in both these brain regions. These same inflammatory
 mediators are upregulated in isolated rat microglia following their in vitro
 exposure to extracellular TFAM. Blocking the receptor for advanced glycation
 endproducts (RAGE) and the macrophage antigen complex (Mac)-1 by specific
 antibodies inhibited the TFAM-induced secretion of MCP-1 by THP-1 monocytic
 cells, which were used to model human microglia. Our data support the
 hypothesis that extracellular TFAM can interact with RAGE and Mac-1 to
 function as a DAMP that causes pro-inflammatory microglial activation.
 Blocking this interaction may represent a potential target for attenuating
 the neuroinflammation observed in neurodegenerative diseases.",
