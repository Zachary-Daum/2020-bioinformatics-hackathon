    abstract "A 21-yr-old intact male walrus ( Odobendus rosmarus divergens)
 presented with acute onset of shifting lameness, initially associated with
 breeding behaviors. Further clinical signs manifested, including muscle
 tremors, anorexia, hematuria, and coughing. Diagnostics were limited, as the
 animal would not offer behaviors for voluntary sample collection. Signs were
 addressed with anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, and antibiotics. The
 walrus developed cluster seizures and ultimately, respiratory and cardiac
 arrest. Postmortem lesions included meningoencephalitis with intra- and
 extracellular protozoal zoites and schizonts, as well as interstitial
 pneumonia with intraendothelial protozoa. Immunolabeling of the protozoal
 organisms revealed Sarcocystis neurona. Previous S. neurona infections in an
 odobenid have not been reported. Protozoal infection should be considered in
 all species of captive marine mammals with nonspecific orthopedic,
 neurological, and respiratory clinical signs.",
