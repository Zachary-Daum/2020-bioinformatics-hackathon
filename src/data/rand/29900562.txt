    abstract "AIM: To assess the feasibility of producing artificial teeth for
 endodontic training using 3D printing technology, to analyse the accuracy of
 the printing process, and to evaluate the teeth by students when used during
 training. METHODOLOGY: Sound extracted human teeth were selected, digitalized
 by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and appropriate software and finally
 reproduced by a stereolithographic printer. The printed teeth were scanned
 and compared with the original ones (trueness) and to one another
 (precision). Undergraduate dental students in the third and fourth years
 performed root canal treatment on printed molars and were subsequently asked
 to evaluate their experience with these compared to real teeth. RESULTS: The
 workflow was feasible for manufacturing 3D printed tooth replicas. The
 absolute deviation after printing (trueness) ranged from 50.9 to 104.3 mum.
 The values for precision ranged from 43.5 to 68.2 mum. Students reported
 great benefits in the use of the replicated teeth for training purposes.
 CONCLUSION: The presented workflow is feasible for any dental educational
 institution who has access to a CBCT unit and a stereolithographic printer.
 The accuracy of the printing process is suitable for the production of tooth
 replicas for endodontic training. Undergraduate students favoured the
 availability of these replicas and the fairness they ensured in training due
 to standardization.",
