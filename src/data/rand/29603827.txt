    abstract "Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and
 acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (A-CIDP) are
 conditions presenting overlapping clinical features during early stages
 (first 4 weeks), although the latter may progress after 8 weeks. The aim of
 this study was to identify predictive factors contributing to their
 differential diagnosis. Clinical records of adult patients with AIDP or
 A-CIDP diagnosed at our institution between January 2006 and July 2017 were
 retrospectively reviewed. Demographic characteristics, clinical
 manifestations, cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) findings, treatment and clinical
 evolution were analyzed. Nerve conduction studies were performed in all
 patients with at least 12 months follow-up. A total of 91 patients were
 included (AIDP, n = 77; A-CIDP, n = 14). The median age was 55.5 years in
 patients with A-CIDP vs 43 years in AIDP (P = .07). The history of diabetes
 mellitus was more frequent in A-CIDP (29% vs 8%, P = .04). No significant
 differences between groups were observed with respect to: human
 immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, presence of auto-immune disorder or
 oncologic disease. Cranial, motor and autonomic nerve involvement rates were
 similar in both groups. Patients in the A-CIDP group showed higher frequency
 of proprioceptive disturbances (83% vs 28%; P < .001), sensory ataxia (46% vs
 16%; P = .01), and the use of combined immunotherapy with corticoids (29% vs
 3%; P = .005). There were no significant differences in CSF findings,
 intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or mortality rates. During the first 8
 weeks both entities are practically indistinguishable. Alterations in
 proprioception could suggest A-CIDP. Searching for markers that allow early
 differentiation could favor the onset of corticotherapy without delay.",
