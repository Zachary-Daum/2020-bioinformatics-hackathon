    abstract "BACKGROUND: Given the integral role that verbs play in sentence
 production, understanding verb deficits is critical to clinical practice.
 Difficulties in sentence production are often directly related to an
 inability to retrieve argument structure information which, according to most
 theoretical accounts, is specified at a lexical level as part of the semantic
 representation of the verb. The presence of an argument complexity effect
 when retrieving verbs in isolation, i.e. increased difficulty with increasing
 number of arguments required by the verb, is considered evidence of the
 integral link between verbs and the ensuing structure. Recent reports,
 however, of relatively intact verb retrieval and impaired argument structure
 suggest that difficulties with verbs and argument structure may not always
 co-occur. One explanation for this is that lexical-syntactic information may
 be stored separately to lexical-semantic information at the lemma level and
 then differentially impaired. AIMS: To determine whether the presence of
 difficulties creating argument structure in a group of people with aphasia
 with verb-retrieval deficits consistently aligned with the underlying nature
 of their impairment, where semantic involvement resulted in argument
 structure difficulties and post-semantic impairment resulted in intact
 argument structure. This would provide evidence either to support or to
 challenge the view that argument structure is lexically specified. The
 presence of an argument complexity effect within the participants' single
 verb naming was also investigated to examine the relationship between verb
 argument information and any subsequent difficulties creating argument
 structure for sentence production. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Verb retrieval and
 argument structure production were investigated in 12 people with aphasia
 with verb-retrieval deficits on single-word and sentence-production measures.
 OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Eight of the 12 participants presented with a semantic
 verb deficit (five semantic and three mixed semantic and phonological) and
 had difficulties in creating argument structure. Four participants presented
 with a phonological verb deficit. Of these, two had intact argument structure
 while two had impaired argument structure. An argument complexity effect in
 verb naming was seen in both groups. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Semantic
 verb-retrieval deficits consistently resulted in argument structure
 production difficulties, supporting the view that syntactic information is
 stored within the lemma. The presence of argument structure difficulties in
 two participants with phonological deficits; however, lends support for the
 separate coding of lexical-syntactic from lexical-semantic information at the
 lemma level, a factor that has both theoretical and clinical implications
 with respect to diagnosis and management.",
