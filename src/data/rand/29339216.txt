    abstract "Recently we established a novel affinity purification method for
 calpain by exploiting the specific and reversible binding properties of its
 intrinsically disordered protein inhibitor, calpastatin. The immobilization
 strategy relied on the strength and specificity of the biotin - streptavidin
 interaction. Here, we report an improved and optimized method that even
 enables the general applicability of in vivo biotinylated (intrinsically
 disordered) proteins in any affinity capture strategy. Since in vitro
 chemical biotinylation is only accomplished with reagents that lack exact
 site specificity, it can not only cause sample heterogeneity but it can also
 hamper the functionality of the biotinylated molecules. Therefore, we have
 developed a recombinant expression protocol to produce in vivo biotinylated
 human calpastatin domain 1 (hCSD1) in Escherichia coli. We have
 experimentally verified that the biotinylated polypeptide tag is compatible
 with the intrinsically disordered state of hCSD1 and that it does not
 influence the functional properties of this intrinsically disordered protein
 (IDP). The in vivo biotinylated hCSD1 was then used without the need of any
 prepurification step prior to the affinity capturing of its substrate, human
 m-calpain. This leads to a simplified purification strategy that allows
 capturing the calpain efficiently from a complex biological mixture with only
 a single chromatogaphic step and in a considerably reduced timeframe. Our
 approach is generally applicable through the in vivo biotinylation of any IDP
 of interest, and its practical implementation will showcase the power to
 exploit the properties of IDPs in affinity capture strategies.",
