    abstract "PURPOSE: Predicting the biologic behavior of intraductal
 papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) remains challenging. Current guidelines
 utilize patient symptoms and imaging characteristics to determine appropriate
 surgical candidates. However, the majority of resected cysts remain low-risk
 lesions, many of which may be feasible to have under surveillance. We herein
 characterize the most promising and up-to-date molecular diagnostics in order
 to identify optimal components of a molecular signature to distinguish levels
 of IPMN dysplasia. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review of pertinent
 literature, including our own experience, was conducted based on the PRISMA
 guidelines. RESULTS: Molecular diagnostics in IPMN patient tissue, duodenal
 secretions, cyst fluid, saliva, and serum were evaluated and organized into
 the following categories: oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, glycoproteins,
 markers of the immune response, proteomics, DNA/RNA mutations, and
 next-generation sequencing/microRNA. Specific targets in each of these
 categories, and in aggregate, were identified by their ability to both
 characterize a cyst as an IPMN and determine the level of cyst dysplasia.
 CONCLUSIONS: Combining molecular signatures with clinical and imaging
 features in this era of next-generation sequencing and advanced computational
 analysis will enable enhanced sensitivity and specificity of current models
 to predict the biologic behavior of IPMN.",
