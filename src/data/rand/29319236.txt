    abstract "BACKGROUND: The advantage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)
 followed by open esophagectomy for treatment of esophageal squamous cell
 carcinoma has been widely recognized. However, the safety and feasibility of
 NAC for patients receiving minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) remain
 controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential impact
 of prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the clinical outcome of MIE by comparing
 two groups of patients, MIE alone and NAC plus MIE. METHODS: From May 2013 to
 July 2017, 124 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma underwent MIE
 in our department, with 57 cases receiving NAC plus MIE and 67 cases
 receiving MIE alone. Perioperative parameters and short-term postoperative
 survival were compared between these two groups to evaluate the safety and
 feasibility of NAC given before MIE. RESULTS: The group with NAC plus MIE had
 slightly longer operating time, more blood loss, higher morbidity, increased
 chance of surgical intensive care unit stay, and longer surgical intensive
 care unit stay time than the group with MIE alone. However, there was no
 statistically significant difference between these two groups (P > 0.05). The
 number of lymph nodes harvested was similar in the two groups without
 significant difference (P > 0.05). The overall survival was not significantly
 different between these two groups either (P > 0.05), although before surgery
 the clinical stage of the group with NAC plus MIE was more advanced than the
 group with MIE alone. CONCLUSIONS: NAC followed by MIE is safe and feasible
 for treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. NAC does not negatively
 impact the therapeutic outcome of MIE.",
