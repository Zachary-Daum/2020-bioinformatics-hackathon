    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Adult-onset Still disease (AOSD) is a rare
 systemic inflammatory disease of unknown cause. Its symptoms usually include
 persistent fever, fugitive salmon-colored rash, arthritis, sore throat (not
 specific), but it may also lead to internal organs' involvement, which
 presents with enlargement of the liver and spleen, swollen lymph nodes,
 carditis or pleuritis - potentially life-threatening complications. In rare
 cases, AOSD can cause aseptic meningitis or/and encephalitis. CASE
 PRESENTATION: We report a case of 31-year-old male patient, who was referred
 to neurological department for extending diagnostics of frontal lobes lesions
 with involvement of adjacent meninges. Abnormalities have been revealed in
 brain MRI, which was performed due to persistent headaches, visual
 disturbances, fever, fatigue and cognitive decline. Wide differential
 diagnosis was performed including laboratory findings, contrast enhanced MRI,
 MR spectroscopy, flow cytometry and finally brain biopsy to exclude
 neoplastic or infectious origin. Final diagnosis of autoimmune
 meningoencephalitis in adult-onset Still disease has been made. CONCLUSION:
 Adult-onset Still disease is a rare cause of inflammatory changes in central
 nervous system, which if diagnosed, may be treated successfully with steroids
 (commonly available agent), intravenous immunoglobulins or more specific
 immunomodulating regiments.",
