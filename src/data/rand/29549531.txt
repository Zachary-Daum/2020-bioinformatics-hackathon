    abstract "We evaluated the effects of dietary epigallocatechin gallate
 (EGCG) on the performance, biochemical parameters, and liver histopathology
 of fluoride-intoxicated broiler chickens. In total, 160 1-day-old male
 broiler chicks (Ross PM3 strain) were collected and assigned to four groups
 (40 animals each), with four replicates. The control group received a basal
 diet; the F group received 800 mg/kg fluoride; the EGCG group received 400
 mg/kg EGCG; and the EGCG+F group received 400 mg/kg EGCG and 800 mg/kg
 fluoride. The live weight (LW) of F-treated chicks was significantly lower
 than that of the controls. In the F-treated groups, feed intake (FI) and LW
 values were lower, but the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was higher than those
 of the controls. The ratio of heart weight to LW was found to be the highest
 in the F-treated groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate
 aminotransferase (AST), and total oxidant status (TOS) levels in the
 F-treated groups were significantly higher, whereas the increase in total
 cholesterol levels was insignificant than those in the control group. In the
 EGCG+F group, AST, total cholesterol, and TOS levels decreased to a level
 comparable to those in the control group. Histopathological evaluation
 revealed that there were mild changes in the portal region in the EGCG+F
 group; additionally, there was an improvement in liver morphology in the
 EGCG+F group compared to that in the F group. Thus, EGCG has potent
 antioxidant and regenerative effects that can ameliorate the detrimental
 effects of fluoride toxicity on blood parameters and the liver.",
