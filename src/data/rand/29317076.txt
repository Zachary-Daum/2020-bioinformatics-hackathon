    abstract "Yorbik et al. reported novel findings regarding a hypothesized
 relationship between childhood attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
 (ADHD) and later risk for coronary heart disease in adulthood. The authors
 found that mean platelet volume (MPV), a marker of platelet reactivity and a
 presumable biomarker in patients with cardiovascular disease, was
 significantly elevated in children with ADHD compared to healthy controls.
 The mechanistic importance of this novel discovery remains unknown and
 warrants clarification. We have made the novel proposition that environmental
 exposure to the agricultural and combustion air pollutant, nitrous oxide
 (N2O), may be an etiological contributor to neurodevelopmental disorders.
 Clinical studies suggest that N2O may enhance platelet hyperaggregation,
 possibly via its biphasic role as an MAO inhibitor especially at trace levels
 of exposure or via the generation of oxidative stress. Therefore, this
 correspondence briefly details the hypothesis that altered biochemical
 profiles in neurodevelopmental disorders, derived from chronic environmental
 exposure to the agricultural and combustion air pollutant, N2O, may promote
 coronary artery disease in adulthood.",
