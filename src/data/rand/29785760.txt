    abstract "BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic
 inflammatory disease. Numerous studies have associated HS with obesity, and
 recently with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Both obesity and MetS are linked
 with metabolic changes. Thyroid hormones play a central role in metabolism
 and exert pleiotropic effects on adipogenesis and the basal metabolism of
 lipids and glucose. We hypothesized that patients with HS have an altered or
 dysfunctional metabolism expressed as thyroid function. AIM: To investigate
 thyroid function in individuals with HS compared with healthy controls (HCs).
 METHODS: We conducted a retrospective comparative cross-sectional study using
 blood samples and questionnaire-based self-reported information to assess
 thyroid function. RESULTS: Our study comprised 430 patients in a
 population-based HS group, and 20 780 HCs. The age/sex-adjusted analysis
 showed a significantly lower level (P < 0.001) of thyroid-stimulating hormone
 (TSH) and a significantly higher level (P < 0.0001) of total triiodothyronine
 (tT3) for the HS compared with the HC group. The age/sex-adjusted analysis
 also showed a significant association between clinical hyperthyroidism and HS
 (an OR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.19-3.07; P = 0.02). When this analysis was adjusted
 further for the potential confounders of body mass index, smoking and oral
 contraception, the results remained significant. CONCLUSION: This study
 suggests that HS is associated with hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism may
 indicate an altered or dysfunctional metabolism.",
