    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Monitoring hemodynamic and vascular changes in the
 acute stages of mouse stroke models is invaluable in studying ischemic stroke
 pathophysiology. However, there lacks a tool to simultaneously and
 dynamically investigate these changes. METHODS: We integrated laser speckle
 imaging (LSI) and visible-light optical coherence tomography (Vis-OCT) to
 reveal dynamic vascular responses in acute stages in the distal middle
 cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) model in rodents. LSI provides full-field,
 real-time imaging to guide Vis-OCT imaging and monitor the dynamic cerebral
 blood flow (CBF). Vis-OCT offers depth-resolved angiography and oxygen
 saturation (sO2) measurements. RESULTS: Our results showed detailed CBF and
 vasculature changes before, during, and after dMCAO. After dMCAO, we observed
 insignificant sO2 variation in arteries and arterioles and location-dependent
 sO2 drop in veins and venules. We observed that higher branch-order veins had
 larger drops in sO2 at the reperfusion stage after dMCAO. CONCLUSION: This
 work suggests that integrated LSI and Vis-OCT is a promising tool for
 investigating ischemic stroke in mouse models. SIGNIFICANCE: For the first
 time, LSI and Vis-OCT are integrated to investigate ischemic strokes in
 rodent models.",
