    abstract "Real-world evidence has played an important role in expanding
 our knowledge on the treatment and prognostication of advanced renal cell
 carcinoma. This type of data has been particularly helpful in providing a
 better understanding of groups that are traditionally excluded from
 randomized controlled trials. The International mRCC Database Consortium
 (IMDC) represents the largest collection of real-world data on patients with
 advanced kidney cancer treated with targeted therapies. The IMDC prognostic
 model has been used to stratify patients in contemporary clinical trials and
 to provide risk-directed treatment selection in everyday clinical practice.
 More recently, it has been shown to predict response to first-line
 combination immunotherapy in the phase III CheckMate 214 clinical trial. In
 this review, we highlight the real-world evidence associated with the
 treatment of mRCC. We focus on first-line therapy, as well as second-line and
 third-line therapeutic options, including novel immuno-oncology agents. We
 also address the real-world evidence for the use of cytoreductive nephrectomy
 in advanced renal cell carcinoma in the targeted therapy era.",
