    abstract "Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been reported to exert its
 anti-cancer activities in human cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of
 ATO-triggered anti-tumor activity has not been fully elucidated. Recently,
 multiple studies demonstrated that ATO could regulate miRNAs in human
 cancers. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether ATO regulated
 let-7a in breast cancer cells. We found that ATO upregulated let-7a level in
 breast cancer cells. We also found that up-regulation of let-7a inhibited
 cell growth and induced apoptosis and retarded cell migration and invasion.
 We also observed that up-regulation of let-7a enhanced cell growth inhibition
 and invasion suppression induced by ATO treatment. Our findings suggest that
 ATO suppressed cell growth, stimulated apoptosis, and retarded cell invasion
 partly via upregulation of let-7a in breast cancer cells. Our study provides
 a new anti-tumor mechanism of ATO treatment in breast cancer.",
