    abstract "Determining effective strategies for mitigating surface ozone
 (O3) pollution requires knowledge of the relative ambient concentrations of
 its precursors, NO x , and VOCs. The space-based tropospheric column ratio of
 formaldehyde to NO2 (FNR) has been used as an indicator to identify NO x
 -limited versus NO x -saturated O3 formation regimes. Quantitative use of
 this indicator ratio is subject to three major uncertainties: (1) the split
 between NO x -limited and NO x -saturated conditions may shift in space and
 time, (2) the ratio of the vertically integrated column may not represent the
 near-surface environment, and (3) satellite products contain errors. We use
 the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to evaluate the quantitative
 utility of FNR observed from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument over three
 northern midlatitude source regions. We find that FNR in the model surface
 layer is a robust predictor of the simulated near-surface O3 production
 regime. Extending this surface-based predictor to a column-based FNR requires
 accounting for differences in the HCHO and NO2 vertical profiles. We compare
 four combinations of two OMI HCHO and NO2 retrievals with modeled FNR. The
 spatial and temporal correlations between the modeled and satellite-derived
 FNR vary with the choice of NO2 product, while the mean offset depends on the
 choice of HCHO product. Space-based FNR indicates that the spring transition
 to NO x -limited regimes has shifted at least a month earlier over major
 cities (e.g., New York, London, and Seoul) between 2005 and 2015. This
 increase in NO x sensitivity implies that NO x emission controls will improve
 O3 air quality more now than it would have a decade ago.",
