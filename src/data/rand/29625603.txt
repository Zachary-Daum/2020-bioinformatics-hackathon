    abstract "BACKGROUND: Habitual postural patterns are associated with
 musculoskeletal pain, and improving a maladaptive posture requires postural
 awareness in order to lead to clinical improvements. This study aimed to
 develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of an innovative postural
 awareness scale. METHODS: A 12-item Postural Awareness Scale (PAS) was
 developed and administered to 512 chronic pain patients (50.3 +/- 11.4 years,
 91.6% female, 37.1% spinal/shoulder pain) to assess its factor structure and
 reliability. To determine convergent validity, measures of body awareness,
 body responsiveness, body image, and mindfulness were correlated with the
 PAS, as were clinical measures of pain intensity, disability, and mental
 health. Sensitivity to change was assessed in 202 outpatients participating
 in a 10-week multimodal mind-body program. RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed
 two factors (Ease/Familiarity with Postural Awareness and Need for Attention
 Regulation with Postural Awareness) that explained 50.8% of the variance.
 Cronbach's alpha for the complete scale was 0.80; Spearman-Brown coefficient
 of split-half reliability was 0.67; and intra-class correlation was ICC2,1 =
 0.75 (95% confidence interval = 0.71, 0.78). Significant positive
 correlations were found for body awareness (r = 0.23), body responsiveness (r
 = 0.41), body image (r = 0.22-0.32), and mindfulness (r = 0.38); negative
 correlations for pain intensity (r = - 0.14), disability (r = - 0.12),
 depression (r = - 0.23), and stress (r = - 0.29). Postural awareness scores
 increased with a mind-body program (p < 0.001); changes in the PAS were
 negatively correlated with changes in pain intensity (r = - 0.35) in patients
 with spinal/shoulder pain. CONCLUSION: Self-reported postural awareness is
 associated with clinical symptoms in chronic pain patients; improvements in
 postural awareness are longitudinally associated with reduced pain in
 patients with spinal/shoulder pain.",
