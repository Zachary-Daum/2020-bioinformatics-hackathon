    abstract "Purpose Malignancy-related hypercalcemia (MRH) is associated
 with a dismal prognosis. The widespread use of bisphosphonates (BPs),
 availability of more effective drugs in cancer treatment, and improvement in
 supportive care might have attenuated its impact. Patients and Methods To
 assess overall survival (OS) of patients with MRH in a contemporary setting,
 we conducted a retrospective analysis of 306 patients with solid cancer
 hospitalized for symptomatic hypercalcemia. A multivariable Cox proportional
 hazards regression model was performed to evaluate possible prognostic
 factors associated with MRH. Results All patients had serum ionized calcium >
 5.5 mg/dL or total Ca > 10.5 mg/dL. Median age was 57 years, and the majority
 had squamous cell carcinoma (62%) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
 performance status > 1 (96%). Head and neck was the most frequent primary
 site (28%). Forty-five percent had no previous chemotherapy (CT), and
 subsequent CT was administered to 32%. Eighty-three percent received BP with
 no survival gain. Median OS was 40 (95% CI, 33 to 47) days. Patients with a
 performance status > 2, altered mental status, C-reactive protein > 30 mg/L,
 albumin < 2.5 g/dL, or body mass index < 18 kg/m(2) had significantly poorer
 survival in a univariable analysis, and longer OS was related to
 treatment-naive patients, subsequent CT, and breast primary site. In the
 multivariable analysis, subsequent CT led to a median OS improvement of 144
 versus 25 days (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.40; P < .001).
 Conclusion In a contemporary setting, MRH remains a marker of poor prognosis.
 Patients treated with CT had better survival, which suggests that appropriate
 treatment of selected patients might alter the course of this syndrome.",
