    abstract "The retinal pigment epithelium is a monolayer of highly
 specialized pigmented cells located between the neural retina and the Bruch's
 membrane of the choroid. RPE cells play a crucial role in the maintenance and
 function of the underlying photoreceptors. This study introduces a
 spontaneously arising human retinal pigment epithelial cell line, HRPE-2S,
 which was isolated from primary RPE cell culture of 2 days old male donor. We
 characterized morphology and functional properties of the new cell line. The
 immortalized cell line was maintained in culture for more than 70 passages
 and 240 divisions. The average doubling time of the cells was approximately
 22 h and got freezed at 26th passage. The cell line expressed RPE-specific
 markers RPE65 and cell junction protein ZO1 as an epithelial cell marker. It
 also expressed CHX10, PAX6, Nestin, SOX2 as stem and retinal progenitor cell
 markers. Ki67 as a marker of cell proliferation was expressed in all HRPE-2S
 cells. It represented typical epithelial cobblestone morphology and did not
 phenotypically change through several passages. Stem cell-like aggregations
 (neurospheres) were observed in SEM microscopy. The cells represented high
 mitotic index. They could be viable under hypoxic conditions and serum
 deprivation. According to functional studies, the cell line exhibited stem
 cell-like behaviors with particular emphasis on its self-renewal capacity.
 LDH isoenzymes expression pattern confirmed the same cellular source for both
 of the HRPE-2S cells and primary RPE cells. Characteristics of HRPE-2S cells
 promise it as an in vitro model for RPE stem cell-based researches. J. Cell.
