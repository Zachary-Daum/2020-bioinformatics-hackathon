    abstract "PURPOSE: Breaking prolonged sitting reduces postprandial glucose
 and insulin concentrations and influences skeletal muscle molecular signaling
 pathways, but it is unknown whether breaking sitting also affects adipose
 tissue. METHODS: Eleven central overweight participants (seven men and four
 postmenopausal women) 50 +/- 5 yr old (mean +/- SD) completed two mixed-meal
 feeding trials (prolonged sitting vs breaking sitting) in a randomized,
 counterbalanced design. The breaking sitting intervention comprised walking
 for 2 min every 20 min over 5.5 h. Blood samples were collected at regular
 intervals to examine metabolic biomarkers and adipokine concentrations.
 Adipose tissue samples were collected at baseline and at 5.5 h to examine
 changes in mRNA expression and secretion of selected adipokines ex vivo.
 RESULTS: Postprandial glycemia and insulinemia were attenuated by
 approximately 50% and 40% in breaking sitting compared with prolonged sitting
 (iAUC: 359 +/- 117 vs 697 +/- 218 mmol per 330 min.L, P = 0.001, and 202 +/-
 71 vs 346 +/- 150 nmol per 330 min.L, P = 0.001, respectively). Despite these
 pronounced and sustained differences in postprandial glucose and insulin
 concentrations, adipose tissue mRNA expression for various genes (interleukin
 6, leptin, adiponectin, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4, insulin
 receptor substrates 1 and 2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and RAC-alpha
 serine/threonine-protein kinase) and ex vivo adipose tissue secretion of
 interleukin 6, leptin, and adiponectin were not different between trials.
 CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that breaking sitting with short bouts
 of physical activity has very pronounced effects on systemic postprandial
 glucose and insulin concentrations, but this does not translate into
 corresponding effects within adipose tissue.",
