    abstract "Objective: To provide an overview of neuroleptic malignant
 syndrome (NMS) for the general practitioner with the most up-to-date
 information on etiology, workup, and management. Data Sources: The search
 using PubMed included articles with the key words neuroleptic malignant
 syndrome, antipsychotics, neuroleptics, diagnosis, and treatment of
 neuroleptic malignant syndrome published in English from January 2000 to
 2017. Single-case reports and articles dealing with the pediatric patient
 population were excluded. Study Selection: Over 4,000 articles met the search
 criteria. After eliminating single-case reports, pediatric cases, reports in
 pregnant patients, and duplicates, 87 articles underwent screening. Forty-two
 articles were included in this review. Results: The literature is rich with
 cases of NMS associated with the use of neuroleptics and various medications
 with neuroleptic-like effects. Questions remain with regard to
 pathophysiology and optimal treatment. NMS is a rare but potentially lethal
 consequence of the use of antipsychotic medications that requires familiarity
 with the condition in order to rapidly recognize its onset and appropriately
 intervene. Conclusions: NMS mortality rates have declined over the past 30
 years, most likely due to early recognition of the syndrome and appropriate
 intervention. Nonetheless, clinicians, especially primary care clinicians who
 are using this class of drugs more often for adjunctive treatments, must be
 cognizant of this syndrome and the implications of their use..",
