    abstract "BACKGROUND: A multidrug treatment strategy that targets urinary
 proteins with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and
 angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) up-titrated to the respective maximum
 tolerated dose combined with intensified blood pressure (BP) control has been
 found to prevent renal function loss in adults with proteinuric
 nephropathies. Herein, we investigated the effects of this treatment protocol
 in the pediatric patient population. METHODS: From May 2002 to September 2014
 we included in this observational, longitudinal, cohort study 20 consecutive
 children with chronic nephropathies and 24-h proteinuria of >200 mg who had
 received ramipril and losartan up-titrated to the respective maximum approved
 and tolerated doses [mean (standard deviation) dose:2.48 (1.37) mg/m(2) and
 0.61 (0.46) mg/kg daily, respectively]. The primary efficacy endpoint was a
 >50 % reduction in 24-h proteinuria to <200 mg (remission). Secondary
 outcomes included changes in proteinuria, serum albumin, BP, and glomerular
 filtration rate (GFR). RESULTS: Mean (+/- standard deviation) patient age at
 inclusion was 13.8 +/- 2.8 years, and the median [interquartile range (IQR)]
 serum creatinine level and proteinuria were 0.7 (0.6-1.0) mg/dl and 690
 (379-1270) mg/24 h or 435 (252-711) mg/m(2)/24 h, respectively. Proteinuria
 significantly decreased by month 6 of follow-up, and serum albumin levels
 increased over a median follow-up period of 78 (IQR 39-105) months. In the
 nine children who achieved remission, proteinuria reduction persisted
 throughout the whole follow-up without rebounds. The GFR improved in those
 children who achieved remission and worsened in those who did not. The mean
 GFR slopes differed significantly between these two groups (p < 0.05), being
 positive in those children with remission and negative in those without
 remission (+0.023 +/- 0.15 vs.-0.014 +/- 0.23 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/month,
 respectively), whereas BP control was similar between the two groups.
 Hyperkalemia was observed in two children. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy
 with maximum approved doses of ACE inhibitors and ARBs is a safe strategy
 which may achieve proteinuria remission with kidney function stabilization or
 even improvement in a substantial proportion of children with proteinuric
 nephropathies.",
