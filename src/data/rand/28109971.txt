    abstract "BACKGROUND: The optimal on-treatment blood pressure (BP) target
 has been a matter of debate. The recent SPRINT trial showed significant
 benefits of a BP target of <120 mm Hg, albeit with an increase in serious
 adverse effects related to low BP. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were
 searched for randomized trials comparing treating with different BP targets.
 Trial arms were grouped into 5 systolic BP target categories: 1) <160 mm Hg,
 2) <150 mm Hg, 3) <140 mm Hg, 4) <130 mm Hg, and 5) <120 mm Hg. Efficacy
 outcomes of stroke, myocardial infarction, death, cardiovascular death, heart
 failure, and safety outcomes of serious adverse effects were evaluated using
 a network meta-analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen trials that enrolled 55,163
 patients with 204,103 patient-years of follow-up were included. There was a
 significant decrease in stroke (rate ratio [RR] 0.54; 95% confidence interval
 [CI], 0.29-1.00) and myocardial infarction (RR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-1.00) with
 systolic BP <120 mm Hg (vs <160 mm Hg). Sensitivity analysis using achieved
 systolic BP showed a 72%, 97%, and 227% increase in stroke with systolic BP
 of <140 mm Hg, <150 mm Hg, and <160 mm, respectively, when compared with
 systolic BP <120 mm Hg. There was no difference in death, cardiovascular
 death, or heart failure when comparing any of the BP targets. However, the
 point estimate favored lower BP targets (<120 mm Hg, <130 mm Hg) when
 compared with higher BP targets (<140 mm Hg or <150 mm Hg). BP targets of
 <120 mm Hg and <130 mm Hg ranked #1 and #2, respectively, as the most
 efficacious target. There was a significant increase in serious adverse
 effects with systolic BP <120 mm Hg vs <150 mm Hg (RR 1.83; 95% CI,
 1.05-3.20) or vs <140 mm Hg (RR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.46-3.08). BP targets of <140
 mm Hg and <150 mm Hg ranked #1 and #2, respectively, as the safest target for
 the outcome of serious adverse effects. Cluster plots for combined efficacy
 and safety showed that a systolic BP target of <130 mm Hg had optimal balance
 between efficacy and safety. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hypertension, a
 on-treatment systolic BP target of <130 mm Hg achieved optimal balance
 between efficacy and safety.",
