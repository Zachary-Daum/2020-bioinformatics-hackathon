    abstract "Many organisms use amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) and control
 its stability by various additives and water; however, the underlying
 mechanisms are yet unclear. Here, the effect of water and inorganic additives
 commonly found in biology on the dynamics of the structure of ACC during
 crystallization and on the energetics of this process is studied. Total X-ray
 scattering and pair distribution function analysis show that the short- and
 medium-range order of all studied ACC samples are similar; however, the use
 of in situ methodologies allow the observation of small structural
 modifications that are otherwise easily overlooked. Isothermal calorimetric
 coupled with microgravimetric measurements show that the presence of Mg(2+)
 and of PO4(3-) in ACC retards the crystallization whereas increased water
 content accelerates the transformation. The enthalpy of ACC with respect to
 calcite appears, however, independent of the additive concentration but
 decreases with water content. Surprisingly, the enthalpic contribution of
 water is compensated for by an equal and opposite entropic term leading to a
 net independence of ACC thermodynamic stability on its hydration level.
 Together, these results point toward a kinetic stabilization effect of
 inorganic additives and water, and may contribute to the understanding of the
 biological control of mineral stability.",
