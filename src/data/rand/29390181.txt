    abstract "Free living amoebae (FLA), including pathogenic Naegleria
 fowleri, can colonize and grow within pipe wall biofilms of drinking water
 distribution systems (DWDSs). Studies on the interactions between various FLA
 species in biofilms are limited. Understanding the interaction between FLA
 and the broader biofilm ecology could help better predict DWDS susceptibility
 to N. fowleri colonization. The aim of this study was to determine if N.
 fowleri and other FLAs ( Naegleria, Vermamoeba, Willaertia, and Vahlkampfia
 spp.) cocolonize DWDS biofilm. FLAs commonly isolated from DWDSs ( N.
 fowleri, V. vermiformis, and N. lovaniensis) were introduced into
 laboratory-scale biomonitors to determine the impact of these amoebae on N.
 fowleri's presence and viability. Over 18 months, a single viable amoebae (
 N. fowleri, N. lovaniensis, or V. vermiformis) was detected in each biofilm
 sample, with the exception of N. lovaniensis and N. fowleri, which briefly
 cocolonized biofilm following their coinoculation. The analysis of biofilm
 and bulk water samples from operational DWDSs revealed a similar lack of
 cocolonization with a single FLA detected in 99% ( n = 242) of samples.
 Interestingly, various Naegleria spp. did colonize the same DWDS locations
 but at different times. This knowledge furthers the understanding of
 ecological factors which enable N. fowleri to colonize and survive within
 operational DWDSs and could aid water utilities to control its occurrence.",
