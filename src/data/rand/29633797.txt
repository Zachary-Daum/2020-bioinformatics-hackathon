    abstract "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence
 of patients with Erectile Dysfunction (ED) receiving psychotropic drugs, the
 impact of these drugs on hormonal profile, and the efficacy of PDE5-i in
 these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 1872 patients referring
 for ED to our Andrology Unit. Assessment included serum testosterone,
 gonadotropins, TSH, prolactin, and PSA, and the IIEF-5 questionnaire for ED
 diagnosis. Inclusion criteria were age 21-75 years and IIEF-5 total score </=
 21; exclusion criteria included hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, previous
 prostatectomy, other medication intake, and ED diagnosis prior to
 psychotropic drug treatment. Efficacy was rated with the IIEF-5 (remission:
 total score >/= 22). RESULTS: The prevalence of ED patients treated with
 psychotropic drugs since >/= 3 months was 9.5% (178/1872), subdivided
 according to the drugs used into: Group A, 16 patients treated with atypical
 antipsychotics (9.0%); Group B, 55 patients with benzodiazepines (30.9%);
 Group C, 33 patients with antidepressant drugs (18.5%); and Group D, 74
 patients with multiple psychotropic drugs (41.6%). Patients in Group A were
 significantly younger than other groups (p < 0.05). The hormonal profile
 presented only higher prolactin level in patients treated with
 antipsychotics, alone or in combination (p < 0.05). Overall, 146 patients
 received PDE5-i. Remission rate, after three months of treatment, was
 significantly higher in Group B compared to C and D groups (p < 0.05).
 CONCLUSIONS: A substantial portion of patients receiving psychotropic drugs
 show ED. Sexual performance in these patients benefits from PDE5-i. Age,
 effects of psychiatric disorders, psychotropic drugs, and PDE5-i treatment
 modality accounted for variability of response in this sample.",
