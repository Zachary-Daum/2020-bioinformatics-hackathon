    abstract "The gastroprotective activity of Hericium erinaceus
 polysaccharide was investigated in rats. The antioxidant activities were also
 evaluated. Pre-treatment of polysaccharide could reduce ethanol-induced
 gastric mucosal lesion and pylorus ligation-induced gastric ulcer. The
 polysaccharide exhibited scavenging activities of 1,
 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrozyl and hydroxyl radicals, and ferrous ion-chelating
 ability. In the pylorus ligation-induced model, gastric secretions (volume of
 gastric juice, gastric acid, pepsin and mucus) of ulcer rats administrated
 with polysaccharide were regulated. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and
 interleukins-1beta in serum, and myeloperoxidase activity of gastric tissue
 were reduced, while antioxidant status of gastric tissue was improved.
 Defensive factors (nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, epidermal growth factor)
 in gastric tissue were increased. These results indicate that Hericium
 erinaceus polysaccharide possess gastroprotective activity, and the possible
 mechanisms are related to its regulations of gastric secretions, improvements
 of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant status, as well as increments of
 defensive factors releases.",
