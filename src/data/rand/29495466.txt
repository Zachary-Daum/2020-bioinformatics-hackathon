    abstract "Insecticidal proteins Cry1Ac and Cry2Ac7 from the bacterium
 Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) belong to the three-domain family of Bt toxins.
 Commercial transgenic soybean hybrids produce Cry1Ac to control the larvae of
 the soybean looper (Chrysodeixis includens) and the velvet bean caterpillar
 (Anticarsia gemmatalis). The specificity of Cry1Ac is determined by loops
 extending from domain II and regions of domain III in the three-dimensional
 structure of the toxin. In this study, we constructed a hybrid toxin (H1.2Ac)
 containing domains I and II of Cry1Ac and domain III of Cry2Ac7, in an
 attempt to obtain a protein with enhanced toxicity compared to parental
 toxins. Bioassays with H1.2Ac revealed toxicity against the larvae of A.
 gemmatalis but not against C. includens. Saturation binding assays with
 radiolabeled toxins and midgut brush border membrane vesicles demonstrated no
 specific H1.2Ac binding to C. includens, while binding in A. gemmatalis was
 specific and saturable. Results from competition binding assays supported the
 finding that Cry1Ac specificity against A. gemmatalis is mainly dictated by
 domain II. Taken together, these distinct interactions with binding sites may
 help explain the differential susceptibility to Cry1Ac in C. includens and A.
 gemmatalis, and guide the design of improved toxins against soybean pests.",
