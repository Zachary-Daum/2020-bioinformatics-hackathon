    abstract "BACKGROUND: Different variables determine the performance of
 cyclists, which brings up the question how these parameters may help in their
 classification by specialty. The aim of the study was to determine
 differences in cardiorespiratory parameters of male cyclists according to
 their specialty: flat riders (N.=21), hill riders (N.=35), or sprinters
 (N.=20) and obtain the multivariate model for further cyclists classification
 by specialties, based on selected variables. METHODS: Seventeen variables
 were measured at submaximal and maximum load on the cycle ergometer Cosmed E
 400HK (Cosmed, Rome, Italy) (initial 100 W with 25-W increase, 90-100 rpm).
 Multivariate discriminant analysis was used to determine which variables
 group cyclists within their specialty, and to predict which variables can
 direct cyclists to a particular specialty. RESULTS: Among nine variables that
 statistically contribute to the discriminant power of the model, achieved
 power on the anaerobic threshold and the produced CO2 had the biggest impact.
 The obtained discriminatory model correctly classified 91.43% of flat riders,
 85.71% of hill riders, while sprinters were classified completely correct
 (100%), i.e. 92.10% of examinees were correctly classified, which point out
 the strength of the discriminatory model. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory indicators
 mostly contribute to the discriminant power of the model, which may
 significantly contribute to training practice and laboratory tests in future.",
