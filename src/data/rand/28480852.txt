    abstract "The article assesses the influence of mono- and multivascular
 lesions of coronary arteries on the course of coronary heart disease at
 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. For this purpose, a comprehensive
 survey of 75 patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus type
 2 was arranged. Depending on the number of vascular lesions of the coronary
 arteries, according to the data of coronary arteries computer tomography, all
 patients were divided into two subgroups. The first subgroup included 27
 patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus type 2 with
 monovascular lesions of coronary arteries. To the second subgroup were
 included 48 patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus type 2
 with multivascular lesions of coronary arteries. During the analysis of
 carbohydrate metabolism in cases of coronary heart disease and diabetes
 mellitus type 2 the HOMA index increase by 25.40% and insulin level increase
 by 17.05% were revealed at patients with multivascular lesions of coronary
 arteries in comparison with patients with monovascular lesions of coronary
 arteries, respectively. The combination of coronary heart disease and
 diabetes mellitus type 2 with multivascular lesions of coronary arteries was
 associated with an increase of sortilin level (233,47+/-47,85 ng/l). A
 significant increase in triglycerides, lipoprotein cholesterol of very low
 density influences greatly on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis
 with lesions of greater number of coronary arteries at patients surveyed. At
 patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus type 2 with
 multivascular lesions of coronary arteries the left ventricle myocardial
 re-modeling occurred through the increase of left ventricle's size and cavity.",
