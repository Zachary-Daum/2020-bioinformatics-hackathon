    abstract "A metal-organic framework (MOF) with one-dimensional channels of
 approximately hexagonal cross-section [Ag2(O2CCF2CF2CO2)(TMP)] 1: (TMP
 =2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine) has been synthesized with MeOH filling the
 channels in its as-synthesized form as [Ag2(O2CCF2CF2CO2)(TMP)].n(MeOH)
 1-MEOH: (n = 1.625 by X-ray crystallography). The two types of ligand connect
 columns of Ag(I) centres in an alternating manner, both around the channels
 and along their length, leading to an alternating arrangement of hydrocarbon
 (C-H) and fluorocarbon (C-F) groups lining the channel walls, with the former
 groups projecting further into the channel than the latter. MeOH solvent in
 the channels can be exchanged for a variety of arene guests, ranging from
 xylenes to tetrafluorobenzene, as confirmed by gas chromatography, (1)H
 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and
 (13)C cross-polarization magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. Alkane and
 perfluoroalkane guests, however, do not enter the channels. Although
 exhibiting some stability under a nitrogen atmosphere, sufficient to enable
 crystal structure determination, the evacuated MOF 1: is unstable for periods
 of more than minutes under ambient conditions or upon heating, whereupon it
 undergoes an irreversible solid-state transformation to a non-porous
 polymorph 2: , which comprises Ag2(O2CCF2CF2CO2) coordination layers that are
 pillared by TMP ligands. This transformation has been followed in situ by
 powder X-ray diffraction and shown to proceed via a crystalline
 intermediate.This article is part of the themed issue 'Coordination polymers
 and metal-organic frameworks: materials by design'.",
