    abstract "Radiation therapy is one of the routine treatment modalities for
 cancer patients. Ionizing radiation (IR) can induce bone loss, and
 consequently increases the risk of fractures with delayed and nonunion of the
 bone in the cancer patients who receive radiotherapy. The orchestrated bone
 remodeling can be disrupted due to the affected behaviors of bone cells,
 including bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
 BMSCs and osteoblasts are relatively radioresistant compared with osteoclasts
 and its progenitors. Owing to different radiosensitivities of bone cells,
 unbalanced bone remodeling caused by IR is closely associated with the dose
 absorbed. For doses less than 2 Gy, osteoclastogenesis and adipogenesis by
 BMSCs are enhanced, while there are limited effects on osteoblasts. High
 doses (>10 Gy) induce disrupted architecture of bone, which is usually
 related to decreased osteogenic potential. In this review, studies
 elucidating the biological effects of IR on bone cells (BMSCs, osteoblasts
 and osteoclasts) are summarized. Several potential preventions and therapies
 are also proposed.",
