    abstract "Background: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
 is the most common inherited kidney disease worldwide. The renal phenotype is
 characterized by progressive cystic enlargement of the kidneys leading to a
 decline in renal function, hypertension and often end-stage renal disease
 (ESRD). Supportive care with blood pressure control and management of pain,
 urinary infections and renal stone disease has, until recently, been the
 mainstay of treatment. With the recent approval of tolvaptan for use in
 ADPKD, the disease progression may now be targeted specifically. Algorithms
 that guide treatment initiation have been proposed but a more pragmatic and
 patient-individualized approach is often needed to make decisions regarding
 therapy. It is highly important to identify ADPKD patients with rapidly
 progressive disease who are likely to benefit most from this treatment and
 avoid treatment in patients that are unlikely to reach ESRD. Methods and
 Results: Here we present a series of cases of ADPKD patients in whom therapy
 with tolvaptan has been considered and report the rationale for the treatment
 decisions based on available lifestyle, clinical, biochemical, radiological
 and genetic data. Conclusions: These cases provide a discussion for the use
 of tolvaptan in ADPKD within the nephrology clinic and allow insights into
 the practicalities of using this therapy outside of clinical trials.",
