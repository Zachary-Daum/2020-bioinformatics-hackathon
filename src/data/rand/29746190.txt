    abstract "The categorical model of personality disorder classification in
 the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
 Mental Disorders (5th ed. [DSM-5]; American Psychiatric Association, 2013 )
 is highly and fundamentally problematic. Proposed for DSM-5 and provided
 within Section III (for Emerging Measures and Models) was the Alternative
 Model of Personality Disorder (AMPD) classification, consisting of Criterion
 A (self-interpersonal deficits) and Criterion B (maladaptive personality
 traits). A proposed alternative to the DSM-5 more generally is an empirically
 based dimensional organization of psychopathology identified as the
 Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP; Kotov et al., 2017 ). HiTOP
 currently includes, at the highest level, a general factor of
 psychopathology. Further down are the five domains of detachment,
 antagonistic externalizing, disinhibited externalizing, thought disorder, and
 internalizing (along with a provisional sixth somatoform dimension) that
 align with Criterion B. The purpose of this article is to discuss the
 potential inclusion and placement of the self-interpersonal deficits of the
 DSM-5 Section III Criterion A within HiTOP.",
