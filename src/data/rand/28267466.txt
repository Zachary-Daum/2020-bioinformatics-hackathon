    abstract "BACKGROUND: Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a
 leading cause of hospitalization in older persons in the United States.
 Reduced physical function and frailty are major determinants of adverse
 outcomes in older patients with hospitalized ADHF. However, these are not
 addressed by current heart failure (HF) management strategies and there has
 been little study of exercise training in older, frail HF patients with
 recent ADHF. HYPOTHESIS: Targeting physical frailty with a multi-domain
 structured physical rehabilitation intervention will improve physical
 function and reduce adverse outcomes among older patients experiencing a HF
 hospitalization. STUDY DESIGN: REHAB-HF is a multi-center clinical trial in
 which 360 patients >/=60 years hospitalized with ADHF will be randomized
 either to a novel 12-week multi-domain physical rehabilitation intervention
 or to attention control. The goal of the intervention is to improve balance,
 mobility, strength and endurance utilizing reproducible, targeted exercises
 administered by a multi-disciplinary team with specific milestones for
 progression. The primary study aim is to assess the efficacy of the REHAB-HF
 intervention on physical function measured by total Short Physical
 Performance Battery score. The secondary outcome is 6-month all-cause
 rehospitalization. Additional outcome measures include quality of life and
 costs. CONCLUSIONS: REHAB-HF is the first randomized trial of a physical
 function intervention in older patients with hospitalized ADHF designed to
 determine if addressing deficits in balance, mobility, strength and endurance
 improves physical function and reduces rehospitalizations. It will address
 key evidence gaps concerning the role of physical rehabilitation in the care
 of older patients, those with ADHF, frailty, and multiple comorbidities.",
