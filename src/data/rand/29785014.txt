    abstract "Widespread mRNA 3' UTR shortening through alternative
 polyadenylation (1) promotes tumor growth in vivo (2) . A prevailing
 hypothesis is that it induces proto-oncogene expression in cis through
 escaping microRNA-mediated repression. Here we report a surprising enrichment
 of 3'UTR shortening among transcripts that are predicted to act as
 competing-endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for tumor-suppressor genes. Our
 model-based analysis of the trans effect of 3' UTR shortening (MAT3UTR)
 reveals a significant role in altering ceRNA expression. MAT3UTR predicts
 many trans-targets of 3' UTR shortening, including PTEN, a crucial
 tumor-suppressor gene (3) involved in ceRNA crosstalk (4) with nine 3
'UTR-shortening genes, including EPS15 and NFIA. Knockdown of NUDT21, a master
 3' UTR-shortening regulator (2) , represses tumor-suppressor genes such as
 PHF6 and LARP1 in trans in a miRNA-dependent manner. Together, the results of
 our analysis suggest a major role of 3' UTR shortening in repressing
 tumor-suppressor genes in trans by disrupting ceRNA crosstalk, rather than
 inducing proto-oncogenes in cis.",
