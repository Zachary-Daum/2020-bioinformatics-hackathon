    abstract "Physical models typically assume time-independent interactions,
 whereas neural networks and machine learning incorporate interactions that
 function as adjustable parameters. Here we demonstrate a new type of abundant
 cooperative nonlinear dynamics where learning is attributed solely to the
 nodes, instead of the network links which their number is significantly
 larger. The nodal, neuronal, fast adaptation follows its relative anisotropic
 (dendritic) input timings, as indicated experimentally, similarly to the slow
 learning mechanism currently attributed to the links, synapses. It represents
 a non-local learning rule, where effectively many incoming links to a node
 concurrently undergo the same adaptation. The network dynamics is now
 counterintuitively governed by the weak links, which previously were assumed
 to be insignificant. This cooperative nonlinear dynamic adaptation presents a
 self-controlled mechanism to prevent divergence or vanishing of the learning
 parameters, as opposed to learning by links, and also supports
 self-oscillations of the effective learning parameters. It hints on a
 hierarchical computational complexity of nodes, following their number of
 anisotropic inputs and opens new horizons for advanced deep learning
 algorithms and artificial intelligence based applications, as well as a new
 mechanism for enhanced and fast learning by neural networks.",
