    abstract "Endothelium-dependent responses were first demonstrated 40 years
 ago in the aorta. Since then, extensive research has been conducted in vitro
 using conductance vessels and materials derived from them. However, the
 microcirculation controls blood flow to vital organs and has been the focus
 of in vivo studies of endothelium-dependent dilation beginning immediately
 after the first in vitro report. Initial in vivo studies employed a light/dye
 technique for selectively damaging the endothelium to unequivocally prove, in
 vivo, the existence of endothelium-dependent dilation and in the
 microvasculature. Endothelium-dependent constriction was similarly proven.
 Endothelium-dependent agonists include acetylcholine (ACh), bradykinin,
 arachidonic acid, calcium ionophore A-23187, calcitonin gene-related peptide
 (CGRP), serotonin, histamine and endothelin-1. Normal and disease states have
 been studied. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase and
 cytochrome P450 have been shown to generate the mediators of the responses.
 Some of the key enzyme systems generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) like
 superoxide which may prevent EDR. However, one ROS, namely H2 O2 , is one of
 a number of hyperpolarizing factors that cause dilation initiated by
 endothelium. Depending upon microvascular bed, a single agonist may use
 different pathways to elicit an endothelium-dependent response.
 Interpretation of studies using inhibitors of eNOS is complicated by the fact
 that these inhibitors may also inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels.
 Other in vivo observations of brain arterioles failed to establish nitric
 oxide as the mediator of responses elicited by CGRP or by ACh and suggest
 that a nitrosothiol may be a better fit for the latter.",
