    abstract "The Shinkai Seep Field (SSF) in the southern Mariana forearc
 discovered in 2010 is the deepest (~5,700 m in depth) known
 serpentinite-hosted ecosystem dominated by a vesicomyid clam, Calyptogena
 (Abyssogena) mariana. The pioneering study presumed that the animal
 communities are primary sustained by reducing fluid originated from the
 serpentinization of mantle peridotite. For understanding the nutrient and
 energy sources for the SSF community, this study conducted four expeditions
 to the SSF and collected additional animal samples such as polychaetes and
 crustaceans as well as sediments, fragments of chimneys developing on
 fissures of serpentinized peridotite, seeping fluid on the chimneys, and pore
 water within the chimneys. Geochemical analyses of seeping fluids on the
 chimneys and pore water of the chimneys revealed significantly high pH (~10)
 that suggest subseafloor serpentinization controlling fluid chemistry. Stable
 isotope systematics (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) among animals, inorganic
 molecules, and environmental organic matter suggest that the SSF animal
 community mostly relies on the chemosynthetic production while some organisms
 appear to partly benefit from photosynthetic production despite the great
 depth of SSF.",
