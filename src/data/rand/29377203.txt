    abstract "BACKGROUND: Diagnostic outcomes in eating disorder (ED) risk
 reduction trials are important but rarely reported. METHODS: An online
 pragmatic randomized-controlled trial was conducted with young-adult women in
 Australia and New Zealand seeking to improve their body image. Media
 Smart-Targeted (MS-T) was a 9-module program released weekly while control
 participants received tips for positive body image. Eating Disorder
 Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) scores from baseline and 12-month follow-up
 were used to investigate two outcomes: ED onset in those who were
 asymptomatic at baseline (prevention effects); and, ED remission in those who
 met diagnosis at baseline (treatment effects). RESULTS: MS-T participants
 were 66% less likely than controls to develop an ED by 12-month follow-up
 (nonsignificant). MS-T participants who met ED criteria at baseline were 75%
 less likely than controls to still meet diagnostic criteria at follow-up.
 This effect was significant and remained so for both those who did and who
 did not access external face-to-face ED treatment during the trial.
 CONCLUSIONS: While further investigations are necessary, MS-T has fully
 automated procedures, low implementation costs, the potential to be delivered
 at-scale to assist those assist those where face-to-face services are limited
 or not available (e.g., remote areas).",
