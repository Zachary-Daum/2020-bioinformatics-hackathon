    abstract "Background: The poultry industry is in need of effective
 antibiotic alternatives to control outbreaks of necrotic enteritis (NE) due
 to Clostridium perfringens. Methods: This study was conducted to investigate
 the effects of feeding Bacillus coagulans on the growth performance and gut
 health of broiler chickens with C. perfringens-induced NE. Two hundred and
 forty 1-day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned to a 2 x 2 factorial
 arrangement with two dietary B. coagulans levels (0 or 4 x 10(9) CFU/kg of
 diet) and two disease challenge statuses (control or NE challenged). Results:
 NE-induced reduction in body weight gain was relieved by the addition of B.
 coagulans into broiler diets compared with the NE-infected birds. NE
 infection damaged intestinal morphological structure, promoted intestinal C.
 perfringens growth and liver invasion, and enhanced anti-C. perfringens
 specific sIgA concentrations in the gut and specific IgG levels in serum
 compared with the uninfected birds. NE infection significantly (P < 0.05)
 decreased mucin-2 (at 14 d post-infection (DPI), toll -like receptor 2 (TLR2,
 at 7 and 14 DPI), TLR4 (at 7 and 14 DPI), tumor necrosis factor super family
 15 (TNFSF15, at 7 and 14 DPI), lysozyme (LYZ, at 14 DPI) and fowlicidin-2 (at
 7 and 14 DPI) mRNA levels, whereas it dramatically (P = 0.001) increased
 IFN-gamma mRNA levels at 7 DPI. However, challenged birds fed diets
 supplemented with B. coagulans showed a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in
 gut lesion scores, decreased C. perfringens numbers in the cecum and liver,
 and an increase in fowlicidin-2 mRNA levels in compared with the uninfected
 birds. In addition, compared with the non-supplemented group, dietary
 inclusion of B. coagulans improved intestinal barrier structure, further
 increased specific sIgA levels and alkaline phosphatase (IAP) activity in the
 jejunum, enhanced the expression of jejunum lysozyme mRNA, and inhibited the
 growth, colonization, and invasion of C. perfringens; in contrast, it reduced
 serum-specific IgG concentrations and jejunum IFN-gamma mRNA levels.
 Conclusion: These results indicated that dietary B. coagulans supplementation
 appeared to be effective in preventing the occurrence and reducing the
 severity of C. perfringens-induced NE in broiler chickens.",
