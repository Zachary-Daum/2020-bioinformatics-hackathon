    abstract "The frequently applied narrow and non-standard transverse dose
 profiles of intensity modulated photon-beam radiotherapy, lacking lateral
 secondary electron equilibrium, require the use of high-resolution dosimetry
 detectors, and small air-filled detectors are recommended as the reference
 detectors for cross-calibration of the high-resolution detectors. The present
 study focuses on the dosimetric properties of a novel cylindrical ionization
 chamber, the PTW Semiflex 3D 31021. The chamber's effective point of
 measurement was found to lie at (0.41+/-0.04) r downstream the tip of the
 inner surface of the spherical front wall in the axial orientation and
 (0.46+/-0.04) r upstream the chamber axis in the radial orientation. Due to
 its symmetrical design, the sigma values of its lateral dose response
 functions for all chamber's orientations are the same (2.10+/-0.05mm). The
 polarity correction factors obtained in this work do not exceed 0.1% and the
 saturation correction factor was below 1% up to a dose-per-pulse value of
 0.956mGy. The radiation quality correction factor kQ of the chamber as a
 function of the tissue-phantom-ratio, TPR20,10, has been calculated by Monte
 Carlo simulation and has been determined experimentally at the German
 Metrology Institute (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, PTB). The values
 of the non-reference condition correction factor kNR have been
 Monte-Carlo-calculated for use of the chamber at various depths and field
 sizes.",
