    abstract "The Salicornia europaea L. (SE) plant is a halophyte that has
 been widely consumed as a seasoned vegetable, and it has been recently
 reported to counteract chronic diseases related to oxidative and inflammatory
 stress. In this study, we performed an initial phytochemical analysis with in
 vitro biochemical tests and chromatographic profiling of desalted and
 enzyme-digested SE ethanol extract (SE-EE). Subsequently, we evaluated the
 anti-neuroinflammatory and ameliorative potential of SE-EE in LPS-inflicted
 BV-2 microglial cells and scopolamine-induced amnesic C57/BL6N mice,
 respectively. SE-EE possess considerable polyphenols and flavonoids that are
 supposedly responsible to improve its bio-efficacy. SE-EE dose-dependently
 attenuated LPS-induced inflammation in BV-2 cells, significantly repressed
 behavioural/cognitive impairment, dose-dependently regulated the cholinergic
 function, suppressed oxidative stress markers, regulated inflammatory
 cytokines/associated proteins expression and effectively ameliorated
 p-CREB/BDNF levels, neurogenesis (DCX stain), neuron proliferation (Ki67
 stain) in scopolamine-administered mice. Thus, SE-EE extract shows promising
 multifactorial disease modifying activities and can be further developed as
 an effective functional food, drug candidate, or supplemental therapy to
 treat neuroinflammatory mediated disorders.",
