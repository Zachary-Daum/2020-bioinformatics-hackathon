    abstract "The aim of this study was to assess the inbreeding coefficient
 of Polish Konik horses based on runs of homozygosity (ROH). Ninety six horses
 kept in 6 herds located across Poland were genotyped with the use of
 EquineSNP60 BeadChip (Illumina). SNP markers with a Minor Allele Frequency
 lower than 0.01 and SNPs assigned to chromosome X or Y were excluded from the
 study. A total of 50 708 SNPs were included for statistical analysis (SVS
 software, Golden Helix). The analysis showed that the population is in
 genetic equilibrium, with He and Ho estimates both equal to 0.3086. Seven
 categories of Runs of Homozygozity (ROH) length were defined: >0.5, >1, >2,
 >4, >8, >16, >25 Mb. The genomic inbreeding coefficient derived from ROH
 (FROH) calculated for each ROH length ranged from 15.96% based on the
 shortest ROH (>0,5Mb) to 2.71% for the longest ROH (>25Mb). Among individual
 horses, the inbreeding coefficient ranged from 5.25% to 22.41% (for ROH
 >1Mb). Analysis of ROH in Polish Koniks allows for more effective management
 of their inbreeding in the future.",
