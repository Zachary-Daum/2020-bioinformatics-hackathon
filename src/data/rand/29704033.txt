    abstract "Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are undoubtedly treasured
 natural resources for discovering effective medicines in treating and
 preventing various diseases. However, it is still extremely difficult for
 screening the bioactive compounds due to the tremendous constituents in TCMs.
 In this work, the chemical composition of toad venom was comprehensively
 analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled
 with high-resolution LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry and 93 compounds were
 detected. Among them, 17 constituents were confirmed by standard substances
 and 8 constituents were detected in toad venom for the first time. Further, a
 compound database of toad venom containing the fullest compounds was further
 constructed using UPLC coupled with high-sensitivity Qtrap MS. Then a target
 cell-based approach for screening potential bioactive compounds from toad
 venom was developed by analyzing the target cell extracts. The reliability of
 this method was validated by negative controls and positive controls. In
 total, 17 components in toad venom were discovered to interact with the
 target cancer cells. Further, in vitro pharmacological trials were performed
 to confirm the anti-cancer activity of four of them. The results showed that
 the six bufogenins and seven bufotoxins detected in our research represented
 a promising resource to explore bufogenins/bufotoxins-based anticancer agents
 with low cardiotoxic effect. The target cell-based screening method coupled
 with the compound database of toad venom constructed by UPLC-Qtrap-MS with
 high sensitivity provide us a new strategy to rapidly screen and identify the
 potential bioactive constituents with low content in natural products, which
 was beneficial for drug discovery from other TCMs.  Graphical abstract.",
