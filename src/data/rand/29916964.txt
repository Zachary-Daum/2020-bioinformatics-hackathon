    abstract "OBJECTIVE: This study tested longitudinal associations between
 absolute levels of perceived partner responsiveness (PPR; how much people
 perceive that their romantic partners understand, care for, and appreciate
 them), daily negative affect reactivity and positive affect reactivity, and
 all-cause mortality in a sample of 1,208 adults for three waves of data
 collection spanning 20 years. We also tested whether longitudinal changes in
 PPR predicted mortality via affect reactivity. METHODS: Data were taken from
 the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. PPR was
 assessed at waves 1 and 2, affect reactivity to stressors was assessed by
 daily diary reports at wave 2, and mortality status was obtained at wave 3.
 RESULTS: Mediation analyses revealed absolute levels of PPR at wave 1
 predicted wave 3 mortality via wave 2 affective reactivity in the predicted
 direction, but this did not remain robust when statistically accounting for
 covariates (e.g., marital risk, neuroticism), beta = .004, 95% confidence
 interval = -.03 to .04. However, wave 1-2 PPR change predicted negative
 affect (but not positive affect) reactivity to daily stressors at wave 2,
 which then predicted mortality risk a decade later (wave 3); these results
 held when adjusting for relevant demographic, health, and psychosocial
 covariates, beta = -.04, 95% confidence interval = -.09 to -.002.
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings are among the first to provide direct evidence of
 psychological mechanisms underlying the links between intimate relationships
 and mortality and have implications for research aiming to develop
 interventions that increase or maintain responsiveness in relationships over
 time.",
