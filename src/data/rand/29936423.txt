    abstract "Studies from Scotland and Canada confirm large increases in the
 incidence of pregnancies complicated by pregestational type 1 diabetes (T1D).
 With this increased antenatal workload comes more specialization and staff
 expertise, which may be important as diabetes technology use increases. While
 euglycemia remains elusive and obstetrical intervention (earlier delivery,
 increased operative deliveries) is increasing, there have been some notable
 successes in the past 5-10 years. These include a decline in the rates of
 congenital anomaly (Canada) and stillbirths (U.K.) and substantial reductions
 in both maternal hypoglycemia (both moderate and severe) across many
 countries. However, pregnant women with T1D still spend  approximately 30-45%
 of the time (8-11 h/day) hyperglycemic during the second and third
 trimesters. The duration of maternal hyperglycemia appears unchanged in
 routine clinical care over the past decade. This ongoing fetal exposure to
 maternal hyperglycemia likely explains the persistent rates of large for
 gestational age (LGA), neonatal hypoglycemia, and neonatal intensive care
 unit (NICU) admissions in T1D offspring. The Continuous Glucose Monitoring in
 Women With Type 1 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial (CONCEPTT) found that pregnant
 women using real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) spent 5% less time
 (1.2 h/day) hyperglycemic during the third trimester, with clinically
 relevant reductions in LGA, neonatal hypoglycemia, and NICU admissions. This
 article will review the progress in our understanding of the intensive
 glycemic treatment of T1D pregnancy, focusing in particular on the recent
 technological advances in CGM and automated insulin delivery. It suggests
 that even with advanced diabetes technology, optimal maternal dietary intake
 is needed to minimize the neonatal complications attributed to postprandial
 hyperglycemia.",
