    abstract "Time evolution of the fully resolved incompressible homogeneous
 turbulent shear flow in noninteger Fourier dimensions is numerically
 investigated. The Fourier dimension of the flow field is extended from the
 integer value 3 to the noninteger values by projecting the Navier-Stokes
 equation on the fractal set of the active Fourier modes with dimensions
 2.7</=d</=3.0. The results of this study revealed that the dynamics of both
 large and small scale structures are nontrivially influenced by changing the
 Fourier dimension d. While both turbulent production and dissipation are
 significantly hampered as d decreases, the evolution of their ratio is almost
 independent of the Fourier dimension. The mechanism of the energy
 distribution among different spatial directions is also impeded by decreasing
 d. Due to this deficient energy distribution, turbulent field shows a higher
 level of the large-scale anisotropy in lower Fourier dimensions. In addition,
 the persistence of the vortex stretching mechanism and the forward spectral
 energy transfer, which are three-dimensional turbulence characteristics, are
 examined at changing d, from the standard case d=3.0 to the strongly
 decimated flow field for d=2.7. As the Fourier dimension decreases, these
 forward energy transfer mechanisms are strongly suppressed, which in turn
 reduces both the small-scale intermittency and the deviation from
 Gaussianity. Besides the energy exchange intensity, the variations of d
 considerably modify the relative weights of local to nonlocal triadic
 interactions. It is found that the contribution of the nonlocal triads to the
 total turbulent kinetic energy exchange increases as the Fourier dimension
 increases.",
