    abstract "Incorporation of foreign moiety in the lattice of semiconductors
 significantly alters their optoelectronic behavior and opens a plethora of
 new applications. In this paper, we report the synthesis of sulfur-doped zinc
 oxide (S-doped ZnO) nanorods by reacting ZnO nanorods with diammonium sulfide
 in vapor phase. Microscopic investigation revealed that the morphological
 features, such as, the length (2-4 mum) and width (100-250 nm) of the
 original hexagonal ZnO nanorods remained intact post-sulfidation. X-ray
 photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the sulfide sample confirmed the
 incorporation of sulfur into ZnO lattice. The optical measurements suggested
 the extension of absorption threshold into visible region upon sulfidation.
 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities of pure and S-doped ZnO nanorods were
 compared for water oxidation in visible light (lambda > 420 nm), which showed
 several-fold increment in the performance of S-doped ZnO sample; the observed
 amelioration in the PEC activity was rationalized in terms of preferred
 visible light absorption and low resistance of sulfide sample, as evidenced
 by optical and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",
