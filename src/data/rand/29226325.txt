    abstract "Recent studies have exhibited significant roles of lncRNAs in
 various tumors' development, including colon cancer. Our study focused on the
 biological roles of lncRNA MALAT1 in colon cancer. In our study, it was
 demonstrated that MALAT1 was upregulated in human colon cancer cell lines
 including Lovo, HCT116, SW480, and HT29 cells compared to the normal human
 intestinal epithelial HIEC cells. Moreover, we observed that miR-129-5p was
 downregulated in colon cancer cells with a significant increase of HMGB1
 expression. Inhibition of MALAT1 can inhibit the proliferation of colon
 cancer SW480 and HCT116 cells and next, bioinformatics analysis was used to
 predict the target microRNA of MALAT1. miR-129-5p was identified and
 confirmed as a direct regulator of MALAT1 and it was shown that miR-129-5p
 mimics were able to restrain the progression of colon cancer cells. In
 addition, high motility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), was predicted as a mRNA
 target of miR-129-5p. Furthermore, we found that MALAT1 exerted its
 biological functions through regulating HMGB1 by sponging miR-129-5p in
 vitro. Silencing MALAT1 greatly inhibited HMGB1 expression which can be
 reversed by miR-129-5p inhibitors. It was indicated in our investigation that
 MALAT1 may serve as a competing endogenous lncRNA (ceRNA) to mediate HMGB1 by
 sponging miR-129-5p in colon cancer. Taken together, our results indicated
 that MALAT1/miR-129-5p/HMGB1 axis could be provided as an important
 prognostic biomarker in colon cancer development.",
