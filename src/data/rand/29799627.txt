    abstract "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the
 chronic liver diseases that can develop into hepatocirrhosis. The purpose of
 the present study was to investigate the impact of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
 from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) on NASH onset, and to determine
 the biodistribution of double-radiolabeled LPS (R-LPS) biosynthesized in P.
 gingivalis. METHODS: Rats fed a basal diet (BD) or a high-fat diet (HD) were
 injected with P. gingivalis-LPS or R-LPS into the palatine gingiva around the
 right maxillary first molar, and were classified into the following 4 groups:
 BD/LPS (-), BD/LPS (+), HD/LPS (-), and HD/LPS (+) or 2 groups: BD/R-LPS and
 HD/R-LPS. RESULTS: Inflammation in the gingiva of the LPS (+) groups
 progressed significantly more than the LPS (-) groups. Furthermore, in the
 HD/LPS (+) liver, histologic analysis confirmed the presence of NASH,
 characterized by large fat droplets, ballooning degeneration, and
 infiltration of inflammatory cells. When (3) H, (14) C-R-LPS was injected
 into the palatine gingiva, radioactivity in the right palatal mucosa of
 HD/R-LPS rats was the highest in comparison with other regions and was
 significantly elevated after 24 hours compared to BD/R-LPS rats.
 Autoradiographic analysis of the maxilla showed distributions from the
 palatal mucosa to the hard palate and the interdental region. Radioactivity
 in organs of both BD/R-LPS and HD/R-LPS rats were mostly localized to the
 liver even after 24 hours. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the
 transfer of P. gingivalis-LPS from the oral cavity to the liver plays an
 important role in disease exacerbation of NASH.",
