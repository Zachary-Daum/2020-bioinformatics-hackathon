    abstract "CD4(+) T cells differentiate into distinct effector subsets upon
 antigenic stimulation. Cytokines, and micro-environmental factors present
 during T-cell priming, direct differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells into
 pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells. From extensive screening of
 2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol derivatives with various functional groups at
 C(6)-position, BJ-2266, a 6-thioureido-derivative, showed potent inhibitory
 activity on in vitro T helper (Th)-cell differentiation. This compound
 inhibited IFN-gamma and IL-17 production from polyclonal CD4(+) T cells and
 ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD4(+) T cells that were activated by T-cell
 receptor (TCR) engagement. We assessed the inhibitory effect of BJ-2266 in
 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results suggest that
 BJ-2266 treatment significantly suppresses EAE disease progression with
 reduced generation of Th1 and Th17 cells. Notably, Th-cell differentiation
 was significantly suppressed by BJ-2266 treatment with no effect on
 apoptosis, activation and proliferation of activated T cells. Furthermore,
 adoptive transfer of BJ-2266 treated MOG-reactive Th1 and Th17 cells led to a
 lower EAE disease score and better clinical recovery from EAE. The underlying
 mechanism of BJ-2266 effect involved the inhibition of JAK/STAT
 phosphorylation that is critical for Th-cell differentiation. We conclude
 that BJ-2266 regulates the JAK/STAT pathway in response to cytokine signals
 and subsequently suppresses the differentiation of Th-cell responses.",
