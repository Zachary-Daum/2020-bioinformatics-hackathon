    abstract "BACKGROUND: In the treatment of pediatric epilepsy, there is a
 critical demand for effective and safe therapeutic options to address
 patients' unmet clinical needs. Eslicarbazepine acetate is a novel once-daily
 antiepileptic drug and a third-generation single enantiomer member of the
 dibenzazepine family. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate
 the efficacy and safety of eslicarbazepine acetate as add-on treatment for
 focal-onset seizures in pediatric patients using meta-analytical techniques.
 METHODS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, single- or double-blinded add-on
 trials of eslicarbazepine acetate in patients < 18 years of age with
 focal-onset seizures uncontrolled by concomitant stable antiepileptic drug
 regimens were identified through a systematic literature search. The assessed
 outcomes included the mean relative change and >/= 50% reduction in the
 baseline seizure frequency, the incidence of treatment withdrawal, serious
 adverse events, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Risk ratio and
 weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals were estimated for
 dichotomous/continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Two trials were included involving
 386 participants (age range 2-18 years), 217 for eslicarbazepine acetate and
 169 for placebo groups, respectively. At the dosage of 30 mg/kg/day,
 eslicarbazepine acetate-treated patients had a significantly greater
 reduction in baseline seizure frequency (weighted mean difference - 21.67,
 95% confidence interval - 40.87 to - 2.46; p = 0.027) and 58 patients (44.6%)
 were seizure responders compared with 27 controls (29.7%) [risk ratio 1.48,
 95% confidence interval 0.99-2.20; p = 0.055]. There were no differences in
 treatment withdrawal (risk ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.65-2.37; p =
 0.513), serious adverse events (risk ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval
 0.69-2.86; p = 0.350), and treatment-emergent adverse events (risk ratio
 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.94-1.22; p = 0.313). CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive
 eslicarbazepine acetate could be an effective well-tolerated option in
 children and adolescents with focal-onset seizures uncontrolled by one or
 more concomitant anti-epileptic drugs.",
