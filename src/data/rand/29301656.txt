    abstract "The post-infectious autoimmune polyradiculoneuropathy
 Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is triggered by molecular mimicry between
 microbial glycolipid antigens and human peripheral nerve gangliosides. Single
 nucleotide polymorphisms in exon 2 of CD1A (*01/*02) and CD1E (*01/*02) were
 assessed using PCR-RFLP; no significant differences in genotype or allele
 frequency were observed between 200 patients with GBS and 200 healthy
 controls. CD1 gene polymorphisms cannot be recognized as a susceptibility or
 disease-causative factor for GBS in the Bangladeshi population. However,
 further studies are necessary to investigate the CD1A*01/CD1E*01 haplotype
 distribution and its potential causative role in the axonal form of GBS.",
