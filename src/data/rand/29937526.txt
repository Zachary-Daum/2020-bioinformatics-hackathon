    abstract "Cardiovascular malformations are one of the most common birth
 defects among newborns and constitute a leading cause of perinatal and infant
 mortality. Although some risk factors are recognized, the causes of
 cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) remain largely unknown. In this study, we
 aim to identify risk factors for ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in
 Northwest Russia. The study population included singleton births registered
 in the Murmansk County Birth Registry (MCBR) between 1 January 2006 and 31
 December 2011. Infants with a diagnosis of VSD in the MCBR and/or in the
 Murmansk Regional Congenital Defects Registry (up to two years post-delivery)
 constituted the study sample. Among the 52,253 infants born during the study
 period there were 744 cases of septal heart defects (SHDs), which corresponds
 to a prevalence of 14.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) of 13.2(-)15.3] per
 1000 infants. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify VSD
 risk factors. Increased risk of VSDs was observed among infants born to
 mothers who abused alcohol [OR = 4.83; 95% CI 1.88(-)12.41], or smoked during
 pregnancy [OR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.02(-)1.80]. Maternal diabetes mellitus was
 also a significant risk factor [OR = 8.72; 95% CI 3.16(-)24.07], while
 maternal age, body mass index, folic acid and multivitamin intake were not
 associated with increased risk. Overall risks of VSDs for male babies were
 lower [OR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.52(-)0.88].",
