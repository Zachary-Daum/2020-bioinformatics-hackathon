    abstract "Several studies reported sex differences in aldosterone. It is
 unknown whether these differences are associated with differences in volume
 regulation. Therefore we studied both aldosterone and extracellular volume in
 men and women on different sodium intakes. In healthy normotensive men ( n =
 18) and premenopausal women ( n = 18) we investigated plasma aldosterone,
 blood pressure, and extracellular volume ((125)I-iothalamate), during both
 low (target intake 50 mmol Na(+)/day) and high sodium intake (target intake
 200 mmol Na(+)/day) in a crossover setup. Furthermore, we studied the adrenal
 response to angiotensin II infusion (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 ng.kg(-1).min(-1) for
 1 h) on both sodium intakes. Men had a significantly higher plasma
 aldosterone, extracellular volume, and systolic blood pressure than women
 during high sodium intake ( P < 0.05). During low sodium intake,
 extracellular volume and blood pressure were higher in men as well ( P <
 0.05), whereas the difference in plasma aldosterone was no longer significant
 ( P = 0.252). The adrenal response to exogenous angiotensin II was
 significantly lower in men than in women on both sodium intakes. Constitutive
 sex differences in the regulation of aldosterone, characterized by a higher
 aldosterone and a lower adrenal response to exogenous angiotensin II infusion
 in men, are associated with a higher extracellular volume and blood pressure
 in men. These findings suggest that sex differences in the regulation of
 aldosterone contribute to differences in volume regulation between men and
 women.",
