    abstract "The decline in basic and instrumental activities of daily living
 (BADLs and IADLs, respectively) is a well-established clinical hallmark of
 dementia. Growing evidence has shown that systemic subclinical inflammation
 may be related to functional impairment. We evaluated the possible
 association between low-grade systemic inflammation and functional disability
 in older individuals affected by dementia. We explored the association
 between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and BADLs/IADLs
 in older individuals affected by late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD; n
 110), ""mixed"" dementia (n 135), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n 258),
 and compared them with 75 normal Controls. Independent of age, gender,
 comorbidity, and other potential confounders, higher hs-CRP was significantly
 associated with poorer BADLs (loss >/= 1 function) in people with LOAD (odds
 ratio [OR] 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-7.33) and mixed dementia
 (OR 2.48, 95%CI 1.12-5.55), but not in those with MCI (OR 1.38, 95%CI
 0.83-2.45) or Controls (OR 2.98, 95%CI 0.54-10.10). No association emerged
 between hs-CRP and IADLs in any of the sub-group. Our data suggest that
 systemic low-grade inflammation may contribute to functional disability in
 older patients with dementia.",
