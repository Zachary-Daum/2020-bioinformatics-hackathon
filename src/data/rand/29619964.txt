    abstract "PURPOSE: As no completed randomized trials of surgery versus
 stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) in patients with early-stage
 non-small cell lung cancer are available, numerous propensity score studies
 have attempted to mimic the setting of clinical trials using nonrandomized
 data. We performed a meta-analysis of propensity score studies comparing SABR
 and surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The MEDLINE and Embase databases were
 queried up to December 2016. Two authors independently reviewed the records
 for inclusion and extracted outcome measures. The study was conducted
 according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
 Meta-Analyses) and MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in
 Epidemiology) guidelines. The primary meta-analysis and secondary analyses
 were carried out using R (version 3.3.2) at a significance level of .05.
 RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Overall survival
 favored surgery (hazard ratio for SABR vs surgery, 1.48 [95% confidence
 interval, 1.26-1.72]; I(2) = 80.5%). Lung cancer-specific survival was not
 significantly different between SABR and surgery (hazard ratio, 1.17 [95%
 confidence interval, 0.92-1.50]; I(2) = 18.6%). On stratification, overall
 survival favored both lobectomy and sublobar resection over SABR, although
 lung cancer-specific survival was again not significantly different. On
 secondary analysis, the lymph node upstaging rate was 15.6% following
 surgery, with 11.4% of patients receiving chemotherapy. The propensity
 score-matching caliper distance and first-author specialty were found to be
 associated with survival endpoints on regression. CONCLUSIONS: For patients
 with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer who are eligible for either
 treatment, better overall survival was seen after surgery compared with SABR.
 However, lung cancer-specific survival was similar for both treatments.
 Prospective clinical trials are preferred to propensity analyses in
 evaluating the nature of non-cancer-related death after SABR.",
