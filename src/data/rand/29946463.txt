    abstract "Background: The drug pirfenidone has been shown to slow the
 progression and decrease mortality of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
 Its exact mechanism is unknown, but it likely inhibits pro-fibrotic cytokine
 transforming growth factor beta, a known contributor to wound healing. We
 evaluated whether patients taking pirfenidone until lung transplantation had
 increased risk of impaired wound healing post-transplant. This information
 could determine whether pirfenidone should be discontinued prior to listing
 to allow for a wash-out period. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients
 who underwent lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis at Norton Thoracic
 Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, from January 2014 to December 2015. Results:
 We describe 18 patients who took pirfenidone up to a month before transplant.
 Aside from one patient who experienced sternal dehiscence due to a surgical
 issue, all remaining patients did well with no evidence of airway dehiscence.
 Each of these 17 patients had been on pirfenidone for at least 30 days; nine
 patients had been on pirfenidone for over 90 days. Baseline characteristics
 including age, sex, body mass index, renal function, liver function, glucose
 level, pre-transplant corticosteroid use, and post-transplant
 immunosuppressant therapy were similar. Conclusions: In our experience,
 pirfenidone may be safely continued until lung transplantation. Only one
 patient in our series experienced impaired wound healing related to a
 surgical issue, even when pirfenidone was continued until lung
 transplantation. We found no evidence of impaired wound healing or airway
 complications after lung transplantation in patients who were treated with
 pirfenidone before lung transplantation.",
