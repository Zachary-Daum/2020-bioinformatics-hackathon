    abstract "BACKGROUND: Sleepiness at the wheel and driving while engaged in
 other activities are well known risk factors for traffic accidents. This
 article estimates the prevalence of these factors among Italian Professional
 Drivers (PDs) and their impact on reported driving mistakes. METHODS: A
 cross-sectional study was conducted using anonymous questionnaires. PDs
 (n=497) were divided into two groups: high-risk PDs (HiRis_PDs) (those who
 self-reported more than one incident during the last 3 years and/or more than
 one mistake during the past year) and non-HiRis_PDs (subjects who did not
 meet the above-mentioned inclusion criteria). Logistic regression analyses
 were performed to assess the association of self-reported sleepiness and/or
 risky driving behaviour with the condition of being a high-risk driver.
 RESULTS: 161 (32.4%) subjects were defined as HiRis_PDs. Forty-one percent of
 the interviewees experienced at least one episode per month of sudden-onset
 sleep at the wheel. Twenty-eight point two percent reported a regular use of
 a hand-held cell phone. Predictive factors for being HiRis_PDs were: at least
 one self-reported episode per month of falling asleep at the wheel [odds
 ratio (OR) 5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.21-7.80, P<0.001], driving while
 regularly engaged in other activities (mainly hand-held cell phone use) (OR
 6.11, 95% CI 2.90-12.84, P<0.001), and young age (OR 0.96, OR 1 year of age
 increase, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Focusing prevention
 efforts on recognizing sleepiness at the wheel and on avoiding other
 distracting activities while driving can reduce the possibility of driving
 errors on the road by about 5-6 times.",
