    abstract "BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is one of common complications
 of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Increasing evidence suggests
 that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) plays a role in inducing neuronal
 apoptosis in cognitive dysfunction. The lung protective ventilatory
 strategies, which serve to reduce pulmonary morbidity for ARDS patients,
 almost always lead to hypercapnia. Some studies have reported that
 hypercapnia contributes to the risk of cognitive impairment and IL-1beta
 secretion outside the central nervous system (CNS). However, the underlying
 mechanism of hypercapnia aggravating cognitive impairment under hypoxia has
 remained uncertain. This study was aimed to explore whether hypercapnia would
 partake in increasing IL-1beta secretion via activating the NLRP3 (NLR
 family, pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome in the hypoxic CNS and in
 aggravating cognitive impairment. METHODS: The Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that
 underwent hypercapnia/hypoxemia were used for assessment of NLRP3, caspase-1,
 IL-1beta, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 expression by Western blotting or double
 immunofluorescence, and the model was also used for Morris water maze test.
 In addition, Z-YVAD-FMK, a caspase-1 inhibitor, was used to treat BV-2
 microglia to determine whether activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was required
 for the enhancing effect of hypercapnia on expressing IL-1beta by Western
 blotting or double immunofluorescence. The interaction effects were analyzed
 by factorial ANOVA. Simple effects analyses were performed when an
 interaction was observed. RESULTS: There were interaction effects on
 cognitive impairment, apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, activation of NLRP3
 inflammasome, and upregulation of IL-1beta between hypercapnia treatment and
 hypoxia treatment. Hypercapnia + hypoxia treatment caused more serious damage
 to the learning and memory of rats than those subjected to hypoxia treatment
 alone. Expression levels of Bcl-2 were reduced, while that of Bax and
 caspase-3 were increased by hypercapnia in hypoxic hippocampus. Hypercapnia
 markedly increased the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1beta in
 hypoxia-activated microglia both in vivo and in vitro. Pharmacological
 inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and release of IL-1beta might
 ameliorate apoptosis of neurons. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest
 that hypercapnia-induced IL-1beta overproduction via activating the NLRP3
 inflammasome by hypoxia-activated microglia may augment neuroinflammation,
 increase neuronal cell death, and contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive
 impairments.",
