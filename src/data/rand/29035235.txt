    abstract "Weighted vertex cover (WVC), a generalized type of vertex cover,
 is one of the most important combinatorial optimization problems. In this
 paper, we provide a novel solution to the WVC problem from the view of
 network engineering. We model the WVC problem as an asymmetric game on
 weighted networks, where each vertex is treated as an intelligent rational
 agent rather than an inanimate one. Under the framework of asymmetric game,
 we find that strict Nash equilibriums of the asymmetric game are the
 intermediate states between the WVC states and the minimum WVC (MWVC) states.
 Besides, we propose best response algorithms with memory and feedback to
 solve the WVC problem, and find that a better approximate solution to the
 MWVC can be obtained under the feedback-based best response algorithm.
 Numerical illustrations verify the performance of the proposed game solution
 on weighted networks. Our findings pave a new way to solve the WVC problem
 from the perspective of asymmetric game, which opens a bottom-up avenue to
 address the combinatorial optimization problems.",
