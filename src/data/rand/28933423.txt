    abstract "Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a key risk factor in hepatic
 steatosis. In this study, we applied a metabolomic approach to investigate
 the changes in the metabolite profile due to HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis
 and the effects of omega-3 PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) supplementation
 in mice. HHcy was induced in mice by giving DL-Hcy (1.8 g/L) in drinking
 water for 6 weeks, then the mice were sacrificed, and the metabolic profiles
 of the liver and plasma were analyzed through UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS-based
 lipidomics. Hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol were further assayed. The
 expression of ceramide metabolism-related genes was measured by quantitative
 PCR. Compared with control mice, HHcy mice exhibited hepatic steatosis with a
 notable increase in ceramide-related metabolites and subsequent upregulation
 of ceramide synthesis genes such as Sptlc3, Degs2, Cer4 and Smpd4. Omega-3
 PUFA was simultaneously administered in HHcy mice through chow diet
 containing 3.3% omega-3 PUFA supplement for 6 weeks, which significantly
 ameliorated Hcy-induced hepatic steatosis. The decrease in hepatic lipid
 accumulation was mainly due to reduced hepatic levels of ceramides, which was
 partly the result of the lower expression of ceramide synthesis genes, Sptlc3
 and Degs2. Similar beneficial effects of DHA were observed in Hcy-stimulated
 primary hepatocytes in vitro. In summary, Hcy-induced ceramide elevation in
 hepatocytes might contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis.
 Furthermore, downregulation of ceramide levels through omega-3 PUFA
 supplementation ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation. Thus, ceramide is a
 potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.",
