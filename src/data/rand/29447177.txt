    abstract "BACKGROUND: Substance use and substance use disorders are common
 in people who experience detention or incarceration in Canada, and opioid
 agonist treatment (OAT) may reduce the harms associated with substance use
 disorders. We aimed to define current physician practice in provincial
 correctional facilities in Ontario with respect to prescribing OAT and to
 identify potential barriers and facilitators to prescribing OAT. METHODS: We
 invited all physicians practicing in the 26 provincial correctional
 facilities for adults in Ontario to participate in an online survey. RESULTS:
 Twenty-seven physicians participated, with representation from most
 correctional facilities in Ontario. Of participating physicians, 52% reported
 prescribing methadone and 48% reported prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone to
 patients in provincial correctional facilities. Nineteen percent of
 participants reported initiating methadone treatment and 11% reported
 initiating buprenorphine/naloxone for patients in custody. Participants
 identified multiple barriers to initiating OAT in provincial correctional
 facilities including concerns about medication diversion and safety, concerns
 about initiating treatment in patients who are not currently using opioids,
 lack of linkage with community-based providers and the Ministry of Community
 Safety and Correctional Services policy. Identified facilitators to
 initiating OAT were support from institutional health care staff and
 administrative staff, adequate resources for program delivery and access to
 linkage with community-based OAT providers. CONCLUSIONS: This study
 identifies opportunities to improve OAT programs and to improve access to OAT
 for persons in provincial correctional facilities in Ontario.",
