    abstract "The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei causes Human African
 Trypanosomiasis and Nagana in other mammals. These diseases present a major
 socio-economic burden to large areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Current therapies
 involve complex and toxic regimens, which can lead to fatal side-effects. In
 addition, there is emerging evidence for drug resistance. AN5568 (SCYX-7158)
 is a novel benzoxaborole class compound that has been selected as a lead
 compound for the treatment of HAT, and has demonstrated effective clearance
 of both early and late stage trypanosomiasis in vivo. The compound is
 currently awaiting phase III clinical trials and could lead to a novel oral
 therapeutic for the treatment of HAT. However, the mode of action of AN5568
 in T. brucei is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the mode of action
 of AN5568 against T. brucei, using a combination of molecular and
 metabolomics-based approaches.Treatment of blood-stage trypanosomes with
 AN5568 led to significant perturbations in parasite metabolism. In
 particular, elevated levels of metabolites involved in the metabolism of
 S-adenosyl-L-methionine, an essential methyl group donor, were found. Further
 comparative metabolomic analyses using an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent
 methyltransferase inhibitor, sinefungin, showed the presence of several
 striking metabolic phenotypes common to both treatments. Furthermore, several
 metabolic changes in AN5568 treated parasites resemble those invoked in cells
 treated with a strong reducing agent, dithiothreitol, suggesting redox
 imbalances could be involved in the killing mechanism.",
