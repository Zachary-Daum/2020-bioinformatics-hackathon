    abstract "The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate whether
 non-weight-based dosing (non-WBD) or weight-based dosing (WBD) of vancomycin
 leads to a higher proportion of patients achieving the
 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target. Studies from January 1985 to February
 2017 were identified through Cochrane, MEDLINE and Embase databases. Those
 conducted in adults with end-stage renal disease receiving high-flux
 haemodialysis (HD) and intravenous vancomycin were included. The primary
 outcome was the proportion of patients with a pre-HD vancomycin concentration
 of 15-20 mg/L and/or an area under the concentration-time curve/minimum
 inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) ratio >/=400. Of the 3948 studies
 screened, 5 met the inclusion criteria. The proportion of patients with
 pre-HD concentrations between 15-20 mg/L were 35% (non-WBD) and 13% (WBD)
 post-loading dose. During maintenance dosing, the proportion of patients with
 pre-HD concentrations between 15-20 mg/L were 37% (non-WBD) and 50-67% (WBD).
 The proportion of pre-HD concentrations <15 mg/L was greater in the non-WBD
 group post-loading dose but was similar between the non-WBD and WBD group
 during maintenance dosing. One study reported that all patients had an
 AUC/MIC >/= 400 for micro-organisms with an MIC </= 1 mg/L for weight-based
 maintenance dosing. The limited data suggest that WBD may be preferential as
 there was a smaller proportion of pre-HD concentrations falling below 15
 mg/L. However, larger well-designed studies of higher quality are required to
 provide guidance for vancomycin dosing in the high-flux HD setting. Future
 research should focus on reporting AUC/MIC ratios and exploring clinical
 outcomes in this patient population.",
