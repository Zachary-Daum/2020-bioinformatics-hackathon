    abstract "Thrombosis is one of the biggest obstacles in the clinical
 application of small-diameter tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs). The
 implantation of an unmodified TEBV will lead to platelet aggregation and
 further activation of the coagulation cascade, in which the high
 concentration of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) that is released by platelets
 plays an important role. Inspired by the phenomenon that endothelial cells
 continuously generate endogenous antiplatelet substances via enzymatic
 reactions, we designed a reduced graphene oxide (RGO) based dual-enzyme
 biomimetic cascade to successively convert ADP into adenosine monophosphate
 (AMP) and AMP into adenosine. We used RGO as a support and bound apyrase and
 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) on the surface of RGO through covalent bonds, and
 then, we modified the surface of the collagen-coated decellularized vascular
 matrix with the RGO-enzyme complexes, in which RGO functions as a platform
 with a large open surface area and minimal diffusion barriers for
 substrates/products to integrate two catalytic systems for cascading
 reactions. The experimental results demonstrate that the two enzymes can
 synergistically catalyze procoagulant ADP into anticoagulant AMP and
 adenosine successively under physiological conditions, thus reducing the
 concentration of ADP. AMP and adenosine can weaken or even reverse the
 platelet aggregation induced by ADP, thereby inhibiting thrombosis. Adenosine
 can also accelerate the endothelialization of TEBVs by regulating cellular
 energy metabolism and optimizing the microenvironment, thus ensuring the
 antithrombotic function and patency of TEBVs even after the RGO-enzyme
 complex loses its activity.",
