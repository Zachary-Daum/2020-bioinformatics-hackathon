    abstract "Proteomics and bioinformatics are a useful combined technology
 for the characterization of protein expression level and modulation
 associated with the response to a drug and with its mechanism of action. The
 folate pathway represents an important target in the anticancer drugs
 therapy. In the present study, a discovery proteomics approach was applied to
 tissue samples collected from ovarian cancer patients who relapsed after the
 first-line carboplatin-based chemotherapy and were treated with pemetrexed
 (PMX), a known folate pathway targeting drug. The aim of the work is to
 identify the proteomic profile that can be associated to the response to the
 PMX treatment in pre-treatement tissue. Statistical metrics of the
 experimental Mass Spectrometry (MS) data were combined with a knowledge-based
 approach that included bioinformatics and a literature review through
 ProteinQuest tool, to design a protein set of reference (PSR). The PSR
 provides feedback for the consistency of MS proteomic data because it
 includes known validated proteins. A panel of 24 proteins with levels that
 were significantly different in pre-treatment samples of patients who
 responded to the therapy vs. the non-responder ones, was identified. The
 differences of the identified proteins were explained for the patients with
 different outcomes and the known PMX targets were further validated. The
 protein panel herein identified is ready for further validation in
 retrospective clinical trials using a targeted proteomic approach. This study
 may have a general relevant impact on biomarker application for cancer
 patients therapy selection.",
