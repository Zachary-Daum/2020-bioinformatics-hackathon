    abstract "Our previous study reported the favorable short-term outcome and
 good tolerance of integrating oxaliplatin into capecitabine-based (XELOX
 regimen) preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced rectal
 cancer (LARC). The present study reported the long-term oncological outcome
 of this phase II study. A total of 47 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma
 (stage II or III) were enrolled and received radiotherapy (46 Gy in 23
 fractions) in combination with capecitabine (1,000 mg/m(2), twice daily, on
 days 1-14 and 22-35) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 22). Overall
 survival (OS) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) rate and cumulative incidence
 of recurrences and long-term complications were calculated or observed. As a
 result, 41 patients underwent surgery after preoperative CRT, and the
 cumulative OS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years for these patients were 100.0, 84.5
 and 81.8%, respectively. For the 38 patients who received R0 resection, the
 cumulative OS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 100.0, 89.0 and 86.2%,
 respectively, while the cumulative DFS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 94.6,
 75.3 and 69.7%, respectively. After follow-up at 84 months, the cumulative
 incidence rates of local and distant recurrences at 5 years were 6.6 and
 28.2%, respectively. Oxaliplatin-associated long-term complications were
 seldom observed. Overall, the addition of oxaliplatin to capecitabine-based
 preoperative radiotherapy achieved favorable OS and DFS without increased
 long-term complications in patients with LARC. Therefore, this preoperative
 CRT strategy is a feasible option for such patients.",
