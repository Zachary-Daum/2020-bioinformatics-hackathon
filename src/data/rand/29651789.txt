    abstract "This study investigated whether Mandarin speakers interpret
 prosodic information as focus markers in a sentence-picture verification
 task. Previous production studies have shown that both Mandarin-speaking
 adults and Mandarin-speaking children mark focus by prosodic information
 (Ouyang and Kaiser in Lang Cogn Neurosc 30(1-2):57-72, 2014; Yang and Chen in
 Prosodic focus marking in Chinese four-and eight-year-olds, 2014). However,
 while prosodic focus marking did not seem to affect sentence comprehension in
 adults Mandarin-speaking children showed enhanced sentence comprehension when
 the sentence focus was marked by prosodic information in a previous study
 (Chen in Appl Psycholinguist 19(4):553-582, 1998). The present study
 revisited this difference between Mandarin speaking adults and children by
 applying a newly designed task that tested the use of prosodic information to
 identify the sentence focus. No evidence was obtained that Mandarin-speaking
 children (as young as 3 years of age) adhered more strongly to prosodic
 information than adults but that word order was the strongest cue for their
 focus interpretation. Our findings support the view that children attune to
 the specific means of information structure marking in their ambient language
 at an early age.",
