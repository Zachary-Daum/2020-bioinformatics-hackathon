    abstract "The underlying molecular mechanisms of how dysregulated
 microRNAs (miRNAs) cause neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury (TBI)
 remain elusive. Here we analyzed the biological roles of approximately 600
 genes - we previously found these dysregulated in dying and surviving rat
 hippocampal neurons - that are targeted by ten TBI-altered miRNAs.
 Bioinformatic analysis suggests that neurodegeneration results from a global
 miRNA-mediated suppression of genes essential for maintaining proteostasis;
 many are hub genes - involved in RNA processing, cytoskeletal metabolism,
 intracellular trafficking, cell cycle progression, repair/maintenance,
 bioenergetics and cell-cell signaling - whose disrupted expression is linked
 to human disease. Notably, dysregulation of these essential genes would
 significantly impair synaptic function and functional brain connectivity. In
 surviving neurons, upregulated miRNA target genes are co-regulated members of
 prosurvival pathways associated with cellular regeneration, neural
 plasticity, and development. This study captures the diversity of
 miRNA-regulated genes that may be essential for cell repair and survival
 responses after TBI.",
