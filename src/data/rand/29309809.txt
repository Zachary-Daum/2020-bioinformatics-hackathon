    abstract "Acute inhalation studies are conducted in animals as part of
 chemical hazard identification and for classification and labelling. Current
 methods employ death as an endpoint (Organisation for Economic Co-operation
 and Development (OECD) test guideline (TG) 403 and TG436) while the recently
 approved fixed concentration procedure (FCP) (OECD TG433) uses fewer animals
 and replaces lethality as an endpoint with evident toxicity. Evident toxicity
 is the presence of clinical signs that predict that exposure to the next
 highest concentration will cause severe toxicity or death in most animals.
 Approval of TG433 was the result of an international initiative, led by the
 National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement & Reduction of Animals in
 Research (NC3Rs), which collected data from six laboratories on clinical
 signs recorded for inhalation studies on 172 substances. This paper
 summarises previously published data and describes the additional analyses of
 the dataset that were essential for approval of the TG.",
