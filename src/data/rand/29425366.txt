    abstract "Introduction: Alcohol misuse, in particular binge drinking, is a
 serious concern among military personnel because it is strongly associated
 with adverse consequences and has a deleterious effect on readiness. Although
 most alcohol misuse studies have focused on individual risk factors, studies
 are increasingly examining environmental influences and strategies for
 reducing alcohol risks. The purpose of this study is to address gaps in what
 is known about how service members' perceptions of environmental factors are
 related to binge drinking in the U.S. Marine Corps. Materials and Methods:
 The relationship between Marines' self-reports of environmental factors and
 alcohol binge drinking was assessed in this correlational study using data
 from three large Marine Corps installations drawn from the Department of
 Defense 2011 Health Related Behaviors Survey of Active Duty Military
 Personnel (N = 2,933). We proposed several directional hypotheses based on
 existing civilian and military studies of alcohol use and misuse, as well as
 health behavior theory. Results: Agreement with the statements that alcoholic
 beverages cost too much, that drinking might negatively affect one's military
 career, and that one's immediate supervisor and installation discourage
 alcohol use were independently associated with decreased odds of binge
 drinking (i.e., protective factors). Perceptions that alcoholic beverages are
 difficult to get was particularly protective; the odds of having binged were
 lower for participants who endorsed this belief than for those who did not.
 Perceptions that drinking is part of being in one's unit was a risk factor
 for binge drinking (odds ratio = 1.29). Conclusion: Even after accounting for
 strong sociodemographic correlates, binge drinking was independently
 associated with a number of environmentally oriented perceptions. Beliefs
 that alcohol is affordable and easy to access were the strongest
 environmental correlates of increased risk of binge drinking. Addressing the
 threat alcohol misuse poses to both Marines and mission readiness will likely
 require multiple strategies, including both policy and environmental changes.",
