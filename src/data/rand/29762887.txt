    abstract "Medication errors remain a commonly reported clinical incident
 in health care as highlighted by the World Health Organization's focus to
 reduce medication-related harm. This retrospective quantitative analysis
 examined medication errors reported by staff using an electronic Clinical
 Incident Management System (CIMS) during a 3-year period from April 2014 to
 April 2017 at a metropolitan mental health ward in Western Australia. The aim
 of the project was to identify types of medication errors and the context in
 which they occur and to consider recourse so that medication errors can be
 reduced. Data were retrieved from the Clinical Incident Management System
 database and concerned medication incidents from categorized tiers within the
 system. Areas requiring improvement were identified, and the quality of the
 documented data captured in the database was reviewed for themes pertaining
 to medication errors. Content analysis provided insight into the following
 issues: (i) frequency of problem, (ii) when the problem was detected, and
 (iii) characteristics of the error (classification of drug/s, where the error
 occurred, what time the error occurred, what day of the week it occurred, and
 patient outcome). Data were compared to the state-wide results published in
 the Your Safety in Our Hands (2016) report. Results indicated several areas
 upon which quality improvement activities could be focused. These include the
 following: structural changes; changes to policy and practice; changes to
 individual responsibilities; improving workplace culture to counteract
 underreporting of medication errors; and improvement in safety and quality
 administration of medications within a mental health setting.",
