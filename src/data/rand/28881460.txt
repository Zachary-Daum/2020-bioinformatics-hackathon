    abstract "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The role of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT)
 in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is poorly understood. It is
 particularly unknown how early experiences with caregivers moderate the
 action of OT in BPD. Here, we examined the association of plasma OT levels in
 BPD patients with the experience of compassion and recalled parental behavior
 during childhood. METHODS: Fifty-seven BPD patients and 43 healthy controls
 participated in the study. OT plasma levels were analyzed by
 radioimmunoassay. Subjects additionally completed questionnaires focusing on
 fears of compassion (FOC) and recalled upbringing (""Questionnaire of
 Recalled Parental Rearing Behavior/Fragebogen zum erinnerten elterlichen
 Erziehungsverhalten,"" FEE). RESULTS: BPD patients had significantly lower OT
 plasma levels than healthy controls and differed significantly on all FOC and
 FEE scales; BPD patients had higher FOC scores (indicating more aversion of
 being compassionate to themselves and others and receiving compassion from
 others). They also differed in recalled parenting. In the BPD group, scores
 of the FOC scale ""fear of compassion from others"" were significantly
 negatively correlated with OT levels. Moreover, recalled ""emotional warmth""
 of their parents during childhood was positively correlated with OT plasma
 levels of BPD subjects. No such correlations were found in the control group.
 CONCLUSION: Our results corroborate findings from previous studies reporting
 lower OT levels in patients with BPD. Moreover, peripheral OT seems to be
 linked with the tolerance of compassionate feelings and early experiences
 with caregivers. This is consistent with other findings that OT is an
 important mediator of the experience of emotional warmth from others.",
