    abstract "INTRODUCTION: This was the first exploratory randomized
 controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of a preserved
 tafluprost/timolol fixed combination (TAF/TIM) with a preserved
 latanoprost/timolol fixed combination (LAT/TIM). METHODS: This prospective,
 randomized, open-label study was conducted in Japanese patients with primary
 open-angle glaucoma, including normal-tension glaucoma or ocular
 hypertension. Following a 4-week LAT/TIM run-in period, eligible patients
 entered a 12-week treatment period, during which they received either LAT/TIM
 or TAF/TIM. The efficacy endpoint was the change in intraocular pressure
 (IOP) from baseline to week 12 and the safety endpoints included the changes
 from baseline to week 12 in superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK) score,
 tear breakup time (TBUT), and hyperemia score, as well as adverse events
 (AEs). At week 6, ocular symptoms were evaluated using a questionnaire.
 RESULTS: In total, 131 patients provided informed consent. Of these, 115
 completed the run-in period and were assigned to receive TAF/TIM (n = 60) or
 LAT/TIM (n = 55). At week 12, there were no significant differences between
 the TAF/TIM and LAT/TIM groups in the change from baseline in trough IOP and
 IOP at 4-6 h after instillation. There were no significant differences
 between the two groups in the change from baseline to week 12 in SPK score,
 TBUT, and hyperemia score. However, only in the TAF/TIM group, the total SPK
 score and the inferior cornea SPK score were significantly lower at week 12
 compared with baseline. Eye irritation and eye pain were significantly
 decreased in the TAF/TIM group compared with the LAT/TIM group. Two
 treatment-related AEs were reported in the TAF/TIM group (3.3%) and none in
 the LAT/TIM group, while no serious AEs were reported in either group.
 CONCLUSION: TAF/TIM is as effective as LAT/TIM in terms of IOP-reducing
 effect, with fewer ocular symptoms. TAF/TIM was associated with a significant
 improvement in SPK scores. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry
