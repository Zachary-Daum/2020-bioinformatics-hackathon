    abstract "The pharmacokinetics of TAK-272 (SCO-272), an orally active
 renin inhibitor, was investigated in rats with subcutaneously injected
 turpentine oil, which was an inflammation animal model. Following intravenous
 administration of TAK-272 to the turpentine-treated rats, the systemic
 clearance and volume of distribution decreased with the elevated plasma
 alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) levels. The elevated plasma AGP levels were
 negatively correlated with the plasma unbound fraction of TAK-272 in the
 rats. Although the AUCs of total TAK-272 in the turpentine-treated rats were
 higher than those in the control rats after intravenous and oral
 administration, those of unbound TAK-272, which seem to directly contribute
 to the pharmacological effect and safety, were nearly equal between the
 turpentine-treated and control rats in the respective dose routes. TAK-272
 has been shown to primarily bind to AGP in the human plasma. These results
 strongly suggested that the pharmacokinetic of TAK-272 in humans would also
 be affected by the variation in the plasma AGP levels and should be discussed
 with not only the total concentrations but also the unbound concentrations in
 the clinical trial for patients with elevated plasma AGP levels.",
