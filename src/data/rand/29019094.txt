    abstract "KEY MESSAGE: We found that lipid accumulation in the meristem
 region and the expression of MdLIP2A, which appears to be regulated by
 chromatin remodeling, coincided with endodormancy induction in the 'Fuji'
 apple. In deciduous trees, including apples (Malus x domestica Borkh.), lipid
 accumulation in the meristem region towards endodormancy induction has been
 thought to be an important process for the acquisition of cold tolerance. In
 this study, we conducted histological staining of crude lipids in the
 meristem region of 'Fuji' apples and found that lipid accumulation coincided
 with endodormancy induction. Since a major component of lipid bodies
 (triacylglycerol) is esterified fatty acids, we analysed fatty acid-derived
 volatile compounds and genes encoding fatty acid-modifying enzymes (MdLOX1A
 and MdHPL2A); the reduction of lipid breakdown also coincided with
 endodormancy induction. We then characterised the expression patterns of
 lipid body-regulatory genes MdOLE1 and MdLIP2A during endodormancy induction
 and found that the expression of MdLIP2A correlated well with lipid
 accumulation towards endodormancy induction. Based on these results, we
 conducted chromatin remodelling studies and localized the cis-element in the
 5'-upstream region of MdLIP2A to clarify its regulatory mechanism. Finally,
 we revealed that chromatin was concentrated - 764 to - 862 bp of the 5
'-upstream region of MdLIP2A, which harbours the GARE [gibberellin responsive
 MYB transcription factor binding site] and CArG [MADS-box transcription
 factor binding site] motifs-meristem development-related protein-binding
 sites.",
