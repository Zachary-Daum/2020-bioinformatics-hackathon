    abstract "Naturally occurring ferrihydrite often contains various
 impurities, and Al is one of the most prominent impurities. However, little
 is known about how these impurities impact the physical and chemical
 properties of ferrihydrite with respect to metal(loid) adsorption. In this
 study, a series of Al-containing ferrihydrites were synthesized and exposed
 to a mixed solution containing As(III) and Cr(VI). The results showed that
 the two contaminants can be quickly adsorbed onto the surface of
 Al-containing ferrihydrite under acidic and neutral conditions. With the
 increase of Al molar percentage in ferrihydrites from 0 to 30, the adsorption
 capacity of As(III) decreased, whereas it increased for Cr(VI). On the other
 hand, with the increase of pH value from 3.0 to 11.0, the decreasing rate of
 As(III) was accelerated first, then slowed down, whereas the Cr(VI)
 decreasing rate slowed down dramatically. X-ray diffraction (XRD),
 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis method, transmission electron
 microscopy (TEM) analysis, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping,
 Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
 (ATR-FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to
 characterize Al-containing ferrihydrite. Interestingly, it was found that the
 redox transformation occurred between As(III) and Cr(VI) after the two
 contaminants were coadsorbed onto the surface of Al-containing ferrihydrite.
 The oxidation of As(III) to As(V) and reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) would
 greatly lower the environmental hazard of the As(III) and Cr(VI).",
