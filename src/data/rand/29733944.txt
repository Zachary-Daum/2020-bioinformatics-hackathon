    abstract "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The stem bark of Theobroma cacao
 L. have been used for the treatment of inflammation, toothache, measles and
 malaria in ethnomedicine. However, the anti-inflammatory activity of
 Theobroma cacao stem bark has not been fully elucidated. AIM: The
 anti-inflammatory activity of Theobroma cacao stem bark ethanol extract and
 its fractions was investigated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
 anti-inflammatory effect of ethanol extract of Theobroma cacao stem bark
 (EETc) and its dichloromethane (DCMF), ethylacetate (EAF) and aqueous (AQF)
 fractions was investigated in erythrocytes membrane stabilizing assay and
 carrageenan-induced paw oedema. The anti-inflammatory activity of the EAF and
 EETc was investigated in carrageenan induced-granuloma air pouch models.
 RESULTS: The extract and fractions showed significant membrane stabilizing
 action on rat erythrocytes cell membrane. The oral administration of DCMF,
 EAF and AQF (250mg/kg) significantly inhibited paw oedema induced by
 carrageenan (41.3%, 55.0% and 45.0%, respectively) compared to control group.
 The EAF (62.5, 125 and 250mg/kg) and EETc (250mg/kg) significantly inhibited
 exudates formation in carrageenan air pouch by (63.8, 71.5, 74.5, 64.3%) at
 24h and by (69.4%, 75.7%, 77.1% and 68.4%) at 72h respectively. The EETc and
 EAF significantly reduced neutrophil counts, protein, nitrite, Tumor necrosis
 factor (TNF-alpha) and malondialdehyde (MDA) but increased reduced
 glutathione (GSH) levels compared to control in pouch exudates. The HPLC
 fingerprint of EAF revealed presence of caffeic acid, rutin, ferulic acid and
 morin. CONCLUSION: Ethanol extract of Theobroma cacao and its ethylacetate
 fraction demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity partly by reducing
 neutrophil migration and inflammatory mediator production.",
