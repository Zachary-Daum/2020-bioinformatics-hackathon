    abstract "Estimating the depth of anaesthesia (DoA) in operations has
 always been a challenging issue due to the underlying complexity of the brain
 mechanisms. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are undoubtedly the most
 widely used signals for measuring DoA. In this paper, a novel EEG-based index
 is proposed to evaluate DoA for 24 patients receiving general anaesthesia
 with different levels of unconsciousness. Sample Entropy (SampEn) algorithm
 was utilised in order to acquire the chaotic features of the signals. After
 calculating the SampEn from the EEG signals, Random Forest was utilised for
 developing learning regression models with Bispectral index (BIS) as the
 target. Correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, and area under the
 curve (AUC) were used to verify the perioperative performance of the proposed
 method. Validation comparisons with typical nonstationary signal analysis
 methods (i.e., recurrence analysis and permutation entropy) and regression
 methods (i.e., neural network and support vector machine) were conducted. To
 further verify the accuracy and validity of the proposed methodology, the
 data is divided into four unconsciousness-level groups on the basis of BIS
 levels. Subsequently, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the
 corresponding index (i.e., regression output). Results indicate that the
 correlation coefficient improved to 0.72 +/- 0.09 after filtering and to 0.90
 +/- 0.05 after regression from the initial values of 0.51 +/- 0.17.
 Similarly, the final mean absolute error dramatically declined to 5.22 +/-
 2.12. In addition, the ultimate AUC increased to 0.98 +/- 0.02, and the ANOVA
 analysis indicates that each of the four groups of different anaesthetic
 levels demonstrated significant difference from the nearest levels.
 Furthermore, the Random Forest output was extensively linear in relation to
 BIS, thus with better DoA prediction accuracy. In conclusion, the proposed
 method provides a concrete basis for monitoring patients' anaesthetic level
 during surgeries.",
