    abstract "The population of older adults aged 85 years and over (the very
 old) is growing rapidly in many societies because of increases in life
 expectancy and reduced mortality at older ages. In 2016, 27.3 million very
 old adults were living in the European Union, and in the UK, 2.4% of the
 population (1.6 million) were aged 85 and over. Very old age is associated
 with increased risks of malnutrition, multimorbidity, and disability. Diet
 (nutrition) is a modifiable risk factor for multiple age-related conditions,
 including sarcopenia and functional decline. Dietary characteristics and
 nutrient intakes of the very old have been investigated in several European
 studies of ageing to better understand their nutritional requirements, which
 may differ from those in the young-old. However, there is a major gap in
 regard to evidence for the role of dietary patterns, protein, vitamin D and
 other nutrients for the maintenance of physical and cognitive functioning in
 later life. The Newcastle 85+ Study, UK and the Life and Living in Advanced
 Age, New Zealand are unique studies involving single birth cohorts which aim
 to assess health trajectories in very old adults and their biological, social
 and environmental influences, including nutrition. In this review, we have
 updated the latest findings in nutritional epidemiology with results from
 these studies, concentrating on the diet-physical functioning relationship.",
