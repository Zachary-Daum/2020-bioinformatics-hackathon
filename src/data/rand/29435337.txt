    abstract "Background: Going to work despite feeling sick also known as
 sickness presenteeism is one of the emerging global occupational health
 challenges. Sickness presenteeism negatively affects both health of work
 forces and productivity of organizations in general. However, there is
 insufficient research exploring this situation in majority of the Sub-Saharan
 African countries, including Ethiopia. Thus this study intended to
 investigate the prevalence and determinant factors of sickness presenteeism
 among health care workers, Western Ethiopia. Methods: This study used an
 institution based cross-sectional quantitative study design. The study period
 was from February to March, 2017. We employed simple random sampling method
 to select 360 study samples. Data collection was performed by pre-tested
 structured and self- administered questionnaire. We used SPSS version 20 to
 carry out binary logistic regression analysis. Odds ratio with 95% confidence
 intervals was calculated and significance of associations was determined at
 p-value < 0.05. Results: A total of 344 respondents fully completed the
 survey questionnaire. Mean age with standard deviation was 30.28 +/- 6.181.
 Prevalence of sickness Presenteeism was 52.6% [95%CI: (47.4, 57.8)] in the
 past 12 months. Educational status [AOR:2.1, 95%CI: (1.17,3.90)], financial
 problem [AOR:1.9,95%CI:(1.07,3.46)], sickness absenteeism [AOR:2.7,95%
 CI:(1.50,5.02)], lack of staff replacement [AOR:2.7,95%CI:(1.50,5.02)],
 absence of occupational health services [AOR:3.0,95%CI:(1.34,6.70)], and
 pressure from supervisor [AOR:1.8,95% CI:(1.01,3.31)] were significant
 predictors of the dependent variable. Conclusion: Relatively higher
 proportions of workers indicated sickness presenteeism as compared to other
 studies. Risk factors like educational status, personal financial problem,
 sickness absenteeism, lack of staff replacement, absence of occupational
 health services, and pressure from supervisors considerably increased the
 likely occurrence of employees' sick attendance. It is advisable for health
 care managers to hire adequate health care staffs, to implement basic
 occupational health services and to design strategies which reduce pressure
 from supervisors.",
