    abstract "Along with the digital revolution, information and communication
 technology applications are currently transforming the delivery of health and
 social care services. This paper investigates prevailing opinions toward
 future technology-based healthcare solutions among Austrian healthcare
 professionals. During a biphasic online Delphi survey, panelists rated
 expected outcomes of two future scenarios describing pervasive health
 monitoring applications. Experts perceived that the scenarios were highly
 innovative, but only moderately desirable, and that their implementation
 could especially improve patients' knowledge, quality of healthcare, and
 living standard. Contrarily, monetary aspects, technical prerequisites, and
 data security were identified as key obstacles. We further compared the
 impact of professional affiliation. Clearly, opinions toward pervasive
 healthcare differed between the interest groups, medical professionals,
 patient advocates, and administrative personnel. These data suggest closer
 collaborations between stakeholder groups to harmonize differences in
 expectations regarding pervasive health monitoring.",
