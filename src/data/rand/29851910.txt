    abstract "BACKGROUND: Palliative care (PC) is associated with
 lower-intensity treatment and better outcomes at the end of life. Trauma
 surgeons play a critical role in end-of-life (EOL) care; however, the impact
 of PC on health care utilization at the end of life has yet to be
 characterized in older trauma patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort
 study using 2006 to 2011 national Medicare claims included trauma patients 65
 years or older who died within 180 days after discharge. The exposure of
 interest was inpatient PC during the trauma admission. A non-PC control group
 was developed by exact matching for age, comorbidity, admission year, injury
 severity, length of stay, and post-discharge survival. We used logistic
 regression to evaluate six EOL care outcomes: discharge to hospice,
 rehospitalization, skilled nursing facility or long-term acute care hospital
 admission, death in an institutional setting, and intensive care unit
 admission or receipt of life-sustaining treatments during a subsequent
 hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 294,665 patients who died within 180 days after
 discharge, 2.1% received inpatient PC. Among 5,693 matched pairs, inpatient
 PC was associated with increased odds of discharge to hospice (odds ratio
 [OR], 3.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.54-4.09) and reduced odds of
 rehospitalization (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.15-0.20), skilled nursing
 facility/long-term acute care hospital admission (OR, 0.43; 95% CI,
 0.39-0.47), death in an institutional setting (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.30-0.39),
 subsequent intensive care unit admission (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.72), or
 receiving life-sustaining treatments (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39-0.80).
 CONCLUSION: Inpatient PC is associated with lower-intensity and less
 burdensome EOL care in the geriatric trauma population. Nonetheless, it
 remains underused among those who die within 6 months after discharge. LEVEL
