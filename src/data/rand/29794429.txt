    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: The pathophysiology of renal disease
 progression in autosomal dominant polycystic disease (ADPKD) is largely
 unknown. Recent evidence suggests microvascular dysfunction leading to renal
 ischemia, as an additional pathway for renal function decline. This study
 examined the levels of serum Fas ligand (FasL), serum myostatin and urine
 transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) and their association with
 markers of endothelial dysfunction, in ADPKD patients with preserved or
 impaired renal function. METHODS: Seventy-eight participants were enrolled in
 the study, divided in three groups: Group A consisted of 26 ADPKD patients
 with impaired renal function (eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2), Group B of 26 ADPKD
 patients with preserved renal function (eGFR > 70 ml/min/1.73m2), and Group C
 of 26 age- and sex- matched controls with no history of renal disease. Serum
 FasL, myostatin and urine levels of TGF-beta1 were measured as biomarkers of
 vascular dysfunction, apoptosis and fibrosis with ELISA techniques. RESULTS:
 Group A patients had significantly higher levels of FasL (13.12+/-1.69
 ng/mL), myostatin (4.62+/-0.59 ng/mL) and urine logTGF-beta1 (3.56+/-0.49
 ng/24h) compared to Group B (9.6+/-1.28 ng/mL, 3.06+/-0.35, and 2.09+/-0.37,
 respectively, p< 0.001 for all comparisons) or controls (6.59+/-1.17 ng/mL,
 2.18+/-0.45 ng/ml, and 1.58+/-0.21, respectively, p< 0.001 for all
 comparisons). Patients in Group B had also higher levels of all markers
 compared to controls (p< 0.001), despite having similar renal function. In
 ADKPD patients negative associations of eGFR with FasL (r=-0.799, p< 0.001),
 myostatin (r=-0.856, p< 0.001) and TGF-beta1 (r=-0.476, p< 0.001) but
 positive correlations of these markers with asymmetric dimethylarginine
 (ADMA) (r=0.825; r=0.749; and r=0.599, respectively p< 0.001) were noted.
 Multivariate analysis demonstrated that FasL was independently associated
 with high urine TGF-beta1 (OR 3.774, 95%CI 1.180-12.072, p=0.025).
 CONCLUSIONS: ADPKD patients with moderately preserved renal function have
 higher levels of FasL, myostatin and urine TGF-beta1 than controls. These
 results indicate that an interplay between endothelial dysfunction and renal
 ischemia with mechanisms linked to apoptosis and fibrosis may be present even
 in early stages of ADPKD.",
