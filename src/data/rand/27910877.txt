    abstract "The success of mechanism-based drug discovery depends on the
 definition of the drug target. This definition becomes even more important as
 we try to link drug response to genetic variation, understand stratified
 clinical efficacy and safety, rationalize the differences between drugs in
 the same therapeutic class and predict drug utility in patient subgroups.
 However, drug targets are often poorly defined in the literature, both for
 launched drugs and for potential therapeutic agents in discovery and
 development. Here, we present an updated comprehensive map of molecular
 targets of approved drugs. We curate a total of 893 human and
 pathogen-derived biomolecules through which 1,578 US FDA-approved drugs act.
 These biomolecules include 667 human-genome-derived proteins targeted by
 drugs for human disease. Analysis of these drug targets indicates the
 continued dominance of privileged target families across disease areas, but
 also the growth of novel first-in-class mechanisms, particularly in oncology.
 We explore the relationships between bioactivity class and clinical success,
 as well as the presence of orthologues between human and animal models and
 between pathogen and human genomes. Through the collaboration of three
 independent teams, we highlight some of the ongoing challenges in accurately
 defining the targets of molecular therapeutics and present conventions for
 deconvoluting the complexities of molecular pharmacology and drug efficacy.",
