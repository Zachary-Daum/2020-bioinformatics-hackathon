    abstract "Hospital-physician vertical integration is on the rise. While
 increased efficiencies may be possible, emerging research raises concerns
 about anticompetitive behavior, spending increases, and uncertain effects on
 quality. In this review, we bring together several of the key theories of
 vertical integration that exist in the neoclassical and institutional
 economics literatures and apply these theories to the hospital-physician
 relationship. We also conduct a literature review of the effects of vertical
 integration on prices, spending, and quality in the growing body of evidence
 ( n = 15) to evaluate which of these frameworks have the strongest empirical
 support. We find some support for vertical foreclosure as a framework for
 explaining the observed results. We suggest a conceptual model and identify
 directions for future research. Based on our analysis, we conclude that
 vertical integration poses a threat to the affordability of health services
 and merits special attention from policymakers and antitrust authorities.",
