    abstract "BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) kills approximately two million
 people and infects around nine million worldwide annually. Its proper
 management, especially in resource-limited settings, has been hindered by the
 lack of rapid and easy-to-use diagnostic tests. Sputum smear microscopy
 remains the cheapest, readily available diagnostic method but it only
 identifies less than half of the patients with a HIV/TB co-infection because
 the bacilli would have disseminated from the lungs to other areas of the
 body. The fully automated Xpert(R) MTB/RIF assay is a promising innovation
 for diagnosing TB and detecting resistance to rifampicin. This study aimed to
 evaluate the use of Xpert(R) MTB/RIF assay and microscopy in the diagnosis of
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Namibia, by determining the disease's
 epidemiology and calculating the proportion of cases infected just with TB
 and those with a resistance to rifampicin among the total suspected cases of
 TB in the country. METHODS: This retrospective study analysed TB cases that
 were diagnosed using both the Xpert(R) MTB/RIF assay and microscopy. Data
 were collected from patient records from the Meditech laboratory information
 system of the Namibia Institute of Pathology for the time period of July
 2012-April 2013. Data from 13 regions were collected. RESULTS: The total
 number of specimens collected from patients with symptoms of pulmonary TB was
 1 842. Of these, 594 (32.20%) were found to be positive for MTB by Xpert(R)
 MTB/RIF assay, out of which 443 (24.05%) were also found to be positive by
 microscopy. The remainder was negative. The male patients were more resistant
 to rifampicin when compared to the female patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis
 is widely distributed throughout Namibia, with slightly more males infected
 than females. Most TB patients are also co-infected with HIV. Both microscopy
 and Xpert(R) MTB/RIF assay are crucial for the diagnosis of TB in the
 country. Screening diagnostic efforts should focus on the sexually active HIV
 positive male population who could be the source of more RIF-resistant TB
 than females to prevent its spread.",
