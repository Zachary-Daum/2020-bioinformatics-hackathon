    abstract "Taste and smell alterations have been recognized as common
 symptoms in relation to various cancers. However, previous research suggests
 that patients do not receive sufficient support in managing taste and smell
 alterations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate how
 persons with experience from lung cancer-related taste and smell alterations
 reason about resources and strategies offered and used to manage these
 symptoms. Data from semi-structured individual interviews with 13 women and
 four men were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. We used Kleinman's
 now classic medical anthropological model of local health care systems,
 consisting of the personal, professional, and folk sector, to interpret and
 understand how people respond to sickness experiences in their daily lives.
 By presenting the findings using this model, we demonstrate that most
 strategies for dealing with taste and smell alterations were undertaken in
 the personal sector, i.e. in participants' daily lives, on an individual
 level and in interaction with family, social networks and communities. Taste
 and smell alterations implied two overarching challenges: 1) adjusting to no
 longer being able to trust information provided by one's own senses of taste
 and/or smell, and 2) coming to terms with taste and smell alterations as a
 part of having lung cancer. Health care professionals' involvement was
 described as limited, but appeared to fulfil most participants' expectations.
 However, through provision of normalizing information, practical advice, and
 to some extent, emotional support, health care professionals had potential to
 influence strategies and resources used for dealing with taste and smell
 alterations. With this study, we further the understanding of how people deal
 with lung cancer-related taste and smell alterations and discuss the role of
 health care professionals for this process.",
