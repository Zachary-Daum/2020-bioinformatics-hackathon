    abstract "Cancer cells are adept at evading cell death, but the underlying
 mechanisms are poorly understood. IL-12 plays a critical role in the early
 inflammatory response to infection and in the generation of T-helper type 1
 cells, favoring cell-mediated immunity. IL-12 is composed of two different
 subunits, p40 and p35. This study underlines the importance of IL-12 p40
 monomer (p40) in helping cancer cells to escape cell death. We found that
 different mouse and human cancer cells produced greater levels of p40 than
 p40 homodimer (p402), IL-12, or IL-23. Similarly, the serum level of p40 was
 much greater in patients with prostate cancer than in healthy control
 subjects. Selective neutralization of p40, but not p402, by mAb stimulated
 death in different cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in a tumor model.
 Interestingly, p40 was involved in the arrest of IL-12 receptor (IL-12R)
 IL-12Rbeta1, but not IL-12Rbeta2, in the membrane, and that p40
 neutralization induced the internalization of IL-12Rbeta1 via caveolin and
 caused cancer cell death via the IL-12-IFN-gamma pathway. These studies
 identify a role of p40 monomer in helping cancer cells to escape cell death
 via suppression of IL-12Rbeta1 internalization.",
