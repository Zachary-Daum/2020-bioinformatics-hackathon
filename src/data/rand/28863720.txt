    abstract "A fundamental characteristic of spontaneous brain activity is
 coherent oscillations covering a wide range of frequencies. Interestingly,
 these temporal oscillations are highly correlated among spatially distributed
 cortical areas forming structured correlation patterns known as the resting
 state networks, although the brain is never truly at ""rest."" Here, we
 introduce the concept of harmonic brain modes-fundamental building blocks of
 complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. We define these
 elementary harmonic brain modes as harmonic modes of structural connectivity;
 that is, connectome harmonics, yielding fully synchronous neural activity
 patterns with different frequency oscillations emerging on and constrained by
 the particular structure of the brain. Hence, this particular definition
 implicitly links the hitherto poorly understood dimensions of space and time
 in brain dynamics and its underlying anatomy. Further we show how harmonic
 brain modes can explain the relationship between neurophysiological,
 temporal, and network-level changes in the brain across different mental
 states ( wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia, psychedelic). Notably, when decoded
 as activation of connectome harmonics, spatial and temporal characteristics
 of neural activity naturally emerge from the interplay between excitation and
 inhibition and this critical relation fits the spatial, temporal, and
 neurophysiological changes associated with different mental states. Thus, the
 introduced framework of harmonic brain modes not only establishes a relation
 between the spatial structure of correlation patterns and temporal
 oscillations (linking space and time in brain dynamics), but also enables a
 new dimension of tools for understanding fundamental principles underlying
 brain dynamics in different states of consciousness.",
