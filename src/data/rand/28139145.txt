    abstract "Laser therapies have been shown to provide symptom improvement
 in patients with erythema and telangiectasia of rosacea; however, they are
 associated with side effects such as erythema. Combinatorial treatment with
 pharmacological agents and laser have demonstrated better efficacy, fewer
 side effects and continued long-term remission compared with monotherapies. A
 case of moderate facial erythema that responded well to combination treatment
 with brimonidine 3 mg/g gel and a treatment course of potassium-titanyl
 phosphate (KTP) laser therapy is presented, showing a reduction from
 baseline, maintained after final laser session, by applying brimonidine 3
 mg/g gel daily. Using brimonidine 3 mg/g gel to target post-laser treatment
 erythema is highly effective in minimising refractory erythema. Continued use
 of brimonidine 3 mg/g gel provides a sustained reduction of erythema,
 increasing the visibility of other signs and symptoms of rosacea that may be
 present. This can facilitate the treatment of these additional signs and
 symptoms.",
