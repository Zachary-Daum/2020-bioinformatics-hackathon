    abstract "Guanxinshutong capsule (GXSTC) is an effective and safe
 traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases
 (CVDs) for many years. However, the targets of this herbal formula and the
 underlying molecular mechanisms of action involved in the treatment of CVDs
 are still unclear. In the present study, we used a systems pharmacology
 approach to identify the active ingredients of GXSTC and their corresponding
 targets in the calcium signaling pathway with respect to the treatment of
 CVDs. This method integrated chromatographic techniques, prediction of
 absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, analysis using Kyoto
 Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, network construction, and pharmacological
 experiments. 12 active compounds and 33 targets were found to have a role in
 the treatment of CVDs, and four main active ingredients, including
 protocatechuic acid, cryptotanshinone, eugenol, and borneol were selected to
 verify the effect of (GXSTC) on calcium signaling system in cardiomyocyte
 injury induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation. The results from the present
 study revealed the active components and targets of GXSTC in the treatment of
 CVDs, providing a new perspective to enhance the understanding of the role of
 the calcium signaling pathway in the therapeutic effect of GXSTC.",
