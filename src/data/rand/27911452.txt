    abstract "Photoacoustic tomography has emerged as a promising non-invasive
 imaging technique that integrates the merits of high optical contrast with
 high ultrasound resolution in deep scattering medium. Unfortunately, the
 blood background in vivo seriously impedes the quality of imaging due to its
 comparable optical absorption with contrast agents, especially in
 conventional linear photoacoustic imaging modality. In this study, we
 demonstrated that two hybrids consisting of gold nanorods (Au NRs) and zinc
 tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin (ZnTPP) exhibited a synergetic effect in improving
 optical absorption, conversion efficiency from light to heat, and
 thermoelastic expansion, leading to a notable enhancement in both linear
 (four times greater) and nonlinear (more than six times) photoacoustic
 signals as compared with conventional Au NRs. Subsequently, we carefully
 investigated the interesting factors that may influence photoacoustic signal
 amplification, suggesting that the coating of ZnTPP on Au NRs could result in
 the reduction of gold interfacial thermal conductance with a solvent, so that
 the heat is more confined within the nanoparticle clusters for a significant
 enhancement of local temperature. Hence, both the linear and nonlinear
 photoacoustic signals are enhanced on account of better thermal confinement.
 The present work not only shows that ZnTPP coated Au NRs could serve as
 excellent photoacoustic nanoamplifiers, but also brings a perspective for
 photoacoustic image-guided therapy.",
