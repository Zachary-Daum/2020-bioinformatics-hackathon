    abstract "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the noninvasive form of breast
 cancer (BC), comprises just over 20% of breast cancer cases diagnosed each
 year in the USA. Most patients are treated with local excision of the disease
 followed by whole breast radiation therapy. Total mastectomy is not an
 uncommon approach, and total mastectomy with a contralateral risk-reducing
 mastectomy has been on the rise in the past decade. In estrogen
 receptor-positive disease, patients are often offered endocrine ablative
 therapy with a selective estrogen receptor modulator or an aromatase
 inhibitor as both treatment and prevention. Local regional treatment options
 have no impact upon ultimate overall survival. Long-term survival rates are
 higher in patients with DCIS than with any other form of the disease. Are
 these strikingly high success rates a testament to effective treatment
 strategies or is there a significant subset of DCIS that was unlikely to ever
 progress to invasive ductal carcinoma? DCIS was not seen in the US prior to
 the advent of screening mammography. When compared to other countries, the
 USA has the highest utilization of screening mammography and the incidence
 rate of DCIS. Other lines of evidence include autopsy series examining the
 breast tissue of women who died of other causes, missed-diagnosis series and
 current retrospective reviews of DCIS, all align in support of the concept of
 DCIS as indolent in the majority of cases [3-14]. The evidence suggests that
 both patient and physician misconceptions about DCIS have led to
 overdiagnosis and over-treatment of DCIS. Recently, a gene expression
 profiling tool (12 gene assay, Oncotype DCIS) has emerged that shows
 considerable promise in predicting class in DCIS patients.",
