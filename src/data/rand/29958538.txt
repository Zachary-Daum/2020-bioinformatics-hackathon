    abstract "BACKGROUND: The FDA have recently published draft guidance for
 the development of treatments for early Alzheimer's disease. Key features of
 this guidance are the advocacy of sensitive cognitive measures and a taxonomy
 of disease severity. Whilst desirable patterns of cognitive-functional
 improvement are included, specific measures, and the magnitude of required
 effects, are not described. MAIN SECTION: We describe key elements of the
 guidance content, especially with regard targeting key cognitive domains and
 the means by which they might be efficiently indexed in the disease stages
 included in the guidance. We discuss also the opportunities to assess
 cognitive performance in 'Stage 2' and 'Stage 3' patients, as well as the
 possibilities for effectively assessing function in the latter category. In
 this section we review candidate cognitive assessments that we judge are
 capable of delivering on the guidance specification for sensitive
 neuropsychological measures. This includes detailed consideration of the
 ADCS-PACC and Catch-Cog initiatives. With respect to the magnitude of
 effects, we propose that standardised effect sizes of 0.3 represent a
 reasonable level of efficacy based on the observation that already marketed
 drugs on average deliver this level of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: We propose
 the use of cognitive measures in stage 2 patients to index the cognitive
 skills known to be compromised early in the Alzheimer's disease process. We
 recommend extending the traditional interest in episodic memory to include
 sensitive, reliable and valid measures of attention, working memory and
 aspects of executive function. We propose a focus on these additional
 cognitive abilities based on evidence that performance on tests of these
 domains is moderately well related to functional skills.",
