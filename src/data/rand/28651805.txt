    abstract "There is currently no consensus regarding the survival rate of
 osseointegrated implants in patients with osteoporosis. A systematic review
 with meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the survival rate of implants in
 such patients. The PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and
 SciELO databases were used to identify articles published up to September
 2016. The systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA/PICO
 requirements and the risk of bias was assessed (Australian National Health
 and Medical Research Council scale). The relative risk (RR) of implant
 failure and mean marginal bone loss were analyzed within a 95% confidence
 interval (CI). Fifteen studies involving 8859 patients and 29,798 implants
 were included. The main outcome of the meta-analysis indicated that there was
 no difference in implant survival rate between patients with and without
 osteoporosis, either at the implant level (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.93-2.08; P=0.11)
 or at the patient level (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.50-1.89; P=0.94). However, the
 meta-analysis for the secondary outcome revealed a significant difference in
 marginal bone loss around implants between patients with and without
 osteoporosis (0.18mm, 95% CI 0.05-0.30, P=0.005). Data heterogeneity was low.
 An increase in peri-implant bone loss was observed in the osteoporosis group.
 Randomized and controlled clinical studies should be conducted to analyze
 possible biases.",
