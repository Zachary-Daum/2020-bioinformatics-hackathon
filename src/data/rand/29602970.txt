    abstract "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy
 of the preoperative planning method using a three-dimensional (3D) printed
 model with that of a method using picture archiving and communication system
 (PACS) images in high tibial osteotomy (HTO). METHODS: Patients who underwent
 HTO using a 3D printed model (20 patients) and a method based on PACS images
 (20 patients) from 2012 to 2016 were compared. After obtaining the correction
 angle, in the 3D printed method, the wedge-shaped 3D printed model was
 designed. The PACS method used preoperative radiographs. The accuracy of HTO
 for each method was compared using radiographs obtained at the first
 postoperative year. The preoperative and postoperative posterior tibial slope
 angles were also compared. RESULTS: The weight-bearing line was corrected
 21.2 +/- 11.8% from preoperatively to 61.6 +/- 3.3% postoperatively in the 3D
 group and from 19.4 +/- 12.3% to 61.3 +/- 8.1% in the PACS group. The mean
 absolute difference with the target point was lower in the 3D group (2.3 +/-
 2.5) than in the PACS group (6.2 +/- 5.1; p = 0.005). The number of patients
 in an acceptable range was higher in the 3D group than in the PACS group. The
 posterior tibial slope angle was not significantly different in the 3D group
 (8.6 degrees -8.9 degrees ), but was significantly different in the PACS
 group (9.9 degrees -10.5 degrees , p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: In open-wedge
 HTO, a more accurate correction for successful results could be obtained
 using the 3D printed model. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",
