    abstract "Ligand-controlled non-decarbonylative and decarbonylative
 conversions of acyl fluorides were developed using a Pd(OAc)2/Et3SiH
 combination. When tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) was used as the ligand,
 aldehydes were obtained as simple reductive conversion products. The use of
 1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane (Cy2P(CH2)2PCy2, DCPE) as the ligand,
 however, favored the formation of hydrocarbons, which are decarbonylative
 reduction products.",
