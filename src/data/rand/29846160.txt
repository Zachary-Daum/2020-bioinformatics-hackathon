    abstract "OBJECTIVES: Management of rheumatic diseases (RD) is often
 problematic in pregnant patients, hence the need for guideline
 implementation. This survey-based study aimed to assess beliefs among
 obstetricians and rheumatologists about managing RD in pregnant Lebanese
 patients. METHODS: Questionnaires were completed by a representative sample
 of rheumatologists and obstetricians practicing throughout Lebanon. Collected
 data included physicians' information, opinion on pregnancy in RD patients,
 compatible drugs with fertility, pregnancy and breastfeeding, references used
 in their clinical management, referral to specialists, and knowledge about
 guidelines. Qualitative variables were analysed using Chi-square or Fisher's
 exact tests, and quantitative variables using Wilcoxon or Student t-tests.
 Results were matched against a scoring system based on the EULAR/BSR
 guidelines. p-value <0.05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS:
 Analysis showed high response rates of physicians, especially among
 rheumatologists. Overall, physicians practice was in concordance with
 international guidelines and only few misconceptions were reported. Systemic
 lupus erythematosus (SLE) was associated with risk on fertility, foetal
 malformation and eclampsia while anti-phospholipid (APL) syndrome was
 associated with miscarriage and vasculitis with eclampsia. Spondyloarthritis
 was considered 'safe' in pregnancy. Most physicians think that
 cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and
 azathioprine compromise fertility, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS:
 Our data showed relatively good concordance of the physicians' beliefs with
 the current literature and recommendations. However, we identified
 misconceptions about anti-rheumatic drugs safety in pregnancy and discrepancy
 between rheumatologists and obstetricians practices; hence the need for
 promoting collaboration between both specialties and disseminating knowledge
 to physicians and patients in the Middle East region.",
