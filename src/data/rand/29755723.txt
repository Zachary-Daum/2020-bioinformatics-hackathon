    abstract "The purpose of the present study is to propose a simple
 algorithm for color appearance simulation under a color illuminant.
 Achromatic point is a chromaticity of rays that appear neither red nor green,
 neither blue nor yellow under a given illuminant condition. Saturation and
 hue of surface colors are evaluated with respect to the achromatic point of
 the same lightness, while the achromatic point under a colored illuminant
 depends on the lightness tested. We previously found that this achromatic
 point locus can be simply approximated as a line with a parallel offset from
 the lightness axis of CIE LAB space normalized to daylight. We propose a
 model that applies shifts in the lightness direction after applying
 hue/saturation shifts using the cone-response (von Kries) transformation
 under an iso-lightness constraint, such that achromatic points would be
 aligned with the lightness axis in the CIE LAB space under daylight
 normalization. We tested this algorithm, which incorporates evaluation of
 color appearance in different lightness levels, using #theDress image.
 Resemblance between our simulation and subjective color-matching results
 implies that human color vision possibly processes shifts in color and
 lightness independently, as a previous study reported. Changes in the
 chromaticity distribution of the images were compared with conventional
 models, and the proposed model preserved relative color difference better,
 especially at the lower lightness levels. The better performance in lower
 lightness levels would be advantageous in displays with wider dynamic range
 in luminance. This implies that the proposed model is effective in simulating
 color appearance of images with nonnegligible lightness and color differences.",
