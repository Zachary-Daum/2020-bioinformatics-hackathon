    abstract "Spices in food and beverages and compounds in tobacco smoke
 interact with sensory irritant receptors of the transient receptor potential
 (TRP) cation channel family. TRPV1 (vanilloid type 1), TRPA1 (ankyrin 1) and
 TRPM8 (melastatin 8) not only elicit action potential signaling through
 trigeminal nerves, eventually evoking pungent or cooling sensations, but by
 their calcium conductance they also stimulate the release of calcitonin
 gene-related peptide (CGRP). This is measured as an index of neuronal
 activation to elucidate the chemo- and thermosensory transduction in the
 isolated mouse buccal mucosa of wild types and pertinent knockouts. We found
 that the lipophilic capsaicin, mustard oil and menthol effectively get access
 to the nerve endings below the multilayered squamous epithelium, while
 cigarette smoke and its gaseous phase were weakly effective releasing CGRP.
 The hydrophilic nicotine was ineffective unless applied unprotonated in
 alkaline (pH9) solution, activating TRPA1 and TRPV1. Also, mustard oil
 activated both these irritant receptors in millimolar but only TRPA1 in
 micromolar concentrations; in combination (1 mm) with heat (45  degrees C),
 it showed supraadditive, that is heat sensitizing, effects in TRPV1 and TRPA1
 knockouts, suggesting action on an unknown heat-activated channel and mustard
 oil receptor. Menthol caused little CGRP release by itself, but in subliminal
 concentration (2 mm), it enabled a robust cold response that was absent in
 TRPM8(-/-) but retained in TRPA1(-/-) and strongly reduced by TRPM8
 inhibitors. In conclusion, all three relevant irritant receptors are
 functionally expressed in the oral mucosa and play their specific roles in
 inducing neurogenic inflammation and sensitization to heat and cold.",
