    abstract "Addictions are highly heritable disorders, with heritability
 estimates ranging from 39% to 72%. Multiple studies suggest a link between
 paternal drug abuse and addiction in their children. However, patterns of
 inheritance cannot be explained purely by Mendelian genetic mechanisms.
 Exposure to drugs of abuse results in epigenetic changes that may be passed
 on through the germline. This mechanism of epigenetic transgenerational
 inheritance may provide a link between paternal drug exposure and addiction
 susceptibility in the offspring. Recent studies have begun to investigate the
 effect of paternal drug exposure on behavioral and neurobiological phenotypes
 in offspring of drug-exposed fathers in rodent models. This review aims to
 discuss behavioral and neural effects of paternal exposure to alcohol,
 cocaine, opioids, and nicotine. Although a special focus will be on
 addiction-relevant behaviors, additional behavioral effects including
 cognition, anxiety, and depressive-like behaviors will be discussed.",
