    abstract "Dried sclerotia of Wolfiporia extensa have been used as medicine
 in Asia from Eastern Han Dynasty, and also used as traditional snack called 
""fulingjiabing"" in Beijing, China. In this paper, 18 macro and trace
 elements (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr, V,
 and Zn) in both flesh and peel of Wolfiporia extensa from seven sites of
 Yunnan province in China were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass
 spectrometer. The average recovery rates of certified reference materials for
 GBW10015 (spinach leaves) ranged from 90.5 to 113%, for GBW10028 (citrus
 leaves) from 92.8 to 106%, and for GBW07603 (bush branch and leaves) from
 83.3 to 114.6%. Generally speaking, the concentration of all elements
 determined was at common level. The results of this survey indicate that
 mineral compositions in peel were higher than in flesh. In peel, the contents
 of investigated trace metals in mushroom samples were found to be in the
 range of 1,660-13,400 microg.g(-1) dry matter (dm) for Fe and 29.6-710
 microg.g(-1) dm for Mn. The mean contents of Cr, Cu, Rb, V, and Zn in peel
 were between 10 and 20 microg.g(-1) dm, followed by As, Co, Li, Ni, Pb, Se,
 and Sr with mean contents between 1 and 10 microg.g(-1) dm, while Ag, Cd, and
 Cs had mean contents of <1 microg.g(-1) dm. In flesh, the concentration of Fe
 was in the range of 54-900 microg.g(-1) dm, and it was 1.5-49 microg.g(-1) dm
 for Mn, followed by Ba, Cu, Rb, and Zn in the range of 1 to 10 microg.g(-1)
 dm, while for Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Li, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr, and V it was <1
 microg.g(-1) dm. The concentration of toxic elements, such as As, Cd, and Pb,
 in both flesh and peel was below the permissible limits of World Health
 Organization. However, As and Pb contents in peel were higher than the limits
 permitted in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The results of principal component
 analysis showed that the flesh of Wolfiporia extensa from all the seven sites
 of the Yunnan province tend to cluster together, most probably because the
 origin of mineral elements in both flesh and peel is wood substrate (old and
 dead pine trees).",
