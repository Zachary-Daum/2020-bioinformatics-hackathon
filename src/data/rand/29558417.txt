    abstract "Antibiotic consumption varies greatly between Norwegian
 municipalities. We examine whether this variation is associated with
 inhabitants' consultation rates or general practitioners' (GP) prescription
 rates. Our study comprises consultations and antibiotic prescriptions for
 respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in general practice in all Norwegian
 municipalities with over 5000 inhabitants in 2014. Data was collected from
 The Norwegian Prescription Database, The Directorate of Health's system for
 control and payment of health reimbursements registry and Norway Statistics.
 Consultation rates and prescription rates were categorised in age- and gender
 specific quintiles and the effect on antibiotic consumption was analysed
 using a Poisson regression model. We found that inhabitants with RTIs
 received 42% more prescriptions if they belonged to a municipality with high
 consultation rates compared to low consultation rates [incidence rate ratio
 (IRR) 1.42 (95% CI 1.41-1.44)] and 48% more prescriptions if they belonged to
 a municipality with high prescription rates versus low prescription rates
 [IRR 1.48 (95% KI 1.47-1.50)]. Our results demonstrate that inhabitants'
 consultation rates and GPs' prescription rates have about equal impact on the
 number of RTI antibiotics prescribed at municipality level. These findings
 highlight the importance of interventions targeting patients as well as
 doctors in efforts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic consumption.",
