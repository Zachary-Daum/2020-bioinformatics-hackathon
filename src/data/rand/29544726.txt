    abstract "Numerous studies have suggested that postpartum women show a
 decline in cognitive abilities. However, to date, no study has investigated
 the presence of qualitative alterations in recognition memory processes in
 postpartum women that may lead to a decline in cognitive ability. To address
 this issue, we employed the Remember/Know procedure and functional magnetic
 resonance imaging (fMRI). Behavioral results demonstrated that compared with
 the matched control (CTRL) group, the postpartum (PP) group endorsed ""Rememb
er"" less and ""Know"" more to old items. A univariate analysis of fMRI data
 indicated lower neural activity of the subjective recollection network in the
 PP group than in the CTRL group. We also performed a large-scale functional
 connectivity multivariate pattern analysis (fcMVPA) using task-dependent
 time-series to detect differences in functional connectivity patterns and
 neural interactivity between the PP and CTRL groups. The fcMVPA results
 revealed that the PP group exhibited altered functional connectivity patterns
 from which machine learning algorithms could discriminate group membership
 with 94% accuracy. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that altered
 subjective recollection processes in the PP group during episodic memory
 decisions are associated with diminished neural activity and abnormal
 interactivity across the subjective recollection network. We believe that
 this is one of the first studies demonstrating qualitative alterations in
 recognition memory processes in postpartum women.",
