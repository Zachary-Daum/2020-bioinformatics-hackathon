    abstract "Strong heat loss and brine release during sea ice formation in
 coastal polynyas act to cool and salinify waters on the Antarctic continental
 shelf. Polynya activity thus both limits the ocean heat flux to the Antarctic
 Ice Sheet and promotes formation of Dense Shelf Water (DSW), the precursor to
 Antarctic Bottom Water. However, despite the presence of strong polynyas, DSW
 is not formed on the Sabrina Coast in East Antarctica and in the Amundsen Sea
 in West Antarctica. Using a simple ocean model driven by observed forcing, we
 show that freshwater input from basal melt of ice shelves partially offsets
 the salt flux by sea ice formation in polynyas found in both regions,
 preventing full-depth convection and formation of DSW. In the absence of deep
 convection, warm water that reaches the continental shelf in the bottom layer
 does not lose much heat to the atmosphere and is thus available to drive the
 rapid basal melt observed at the Totten Ice Shelf on the Sabrina Coast and at
 the Dotson and Getz ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea. Our results suggest that
 increased glacial meltwater input in a warming climate will both reduce
 Antarctic Bottom Water formation and trigger increased mass loss from the
 Antarctic Ice Sheet, with consequences for the global overturning circulation
 and sea level rise.",
