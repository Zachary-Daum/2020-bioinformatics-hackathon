    abstract "BACKGROUND: Post-approval research or monitoring is important to
 determine real-world safety of new products; however, evidence is scant for
 vemurafenib in Japanese patients. In Japan, a unique system is officially
 obligated to investigate post-approval safety. Here we report the first
 adverse drug reaction (ADR) data from vemurafenib-treated Japanese patients
 with metastatic melanoma. Data were collected in an early post-marketing
 phase vigilance (EPPV) study. METHODS: ADRs were events for which a causal
 relationship with vemurafenib could not be ruled out or was unknown. ADR data
 were collected for patients treated with vemurafenib (960 mg bid) between 26
 February and 25 August 2015. RESULTS: Among 95 patients, 46 patients had 118
 ADRs (24 serious ADRs in 13 patients). The most common serious ADRs were
 hypersensitivity (n = 1; 3 events), arthralgia (n = 2; 2 events), pyrexia (n
 = 2; 2 events) and drug eruption (n = 2; 2 events). Seven patients had
 serious skin disorders or hypersensitivity, six of whom had prior
 anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies 5-35 days before starting
 vemurafenib. ADR reports of serious skin disorders appeared to be collected
 more rapidly than previously reported. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
 developed in only one patient. CONCLUSIONS: EPPV in Japanese
 vemurafenib-treated patients identified no new safety signals. The most
 serious skin and hypersensitivity ADRs occurred in patients with prior
 anti-PD-1 exposure. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma appeared to be rare in
 Japanese patients. Further research is needed to clarify whether prior
 treatment with anti-PD-1 agents or racial differences affect the
 characteristic profile of cutaneous ADRs in Japanese patients.",
