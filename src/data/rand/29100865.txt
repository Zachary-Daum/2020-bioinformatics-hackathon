    abstract "BACKGROUND: Nasal polyps and comorbid asthma (NPcA) is a common
 united airway disease and is highly heterogeneous with respect to clinical,
 physiologic, and pathologic parameters. The clinical phenotypes of NPcA are
 poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore clinical phenotypes in
 patients with NPcA. METHODS: Patients first diagnosed with NPcA were
 recruited from Rhinological Clinics and Respiratory Clinics. We clustered
 patients with NPcA based on parameters regarding natural courses and
 demographic characteristics. Patients were also evaluated with respect to
 clinical, functional, and inflammatory parameters in both upper and lower
 airways. RESULTS: Clustering of 110 cases resulted in 3 clusters: cluster 1
 (n = 16, 14.55%, atopic NPcA) was predominantly atopic patients with
 child-onset airway symptoms, intermediate disease duration, history of family
 asthma, better lung function, and less severe asthma; cluster 2 (n = 32,
 29.09%, smoking NPcA) was characterized by more smokers, short disease
 duration, adult-onset airway symptoms, less atopy, nonsteroidal
 anti-inflammatory drug sensitivity, prior sinus surgery history, eosinophilic
 airway phenotypes, worse lung function, and severe computed tomography
 appearance; and cluster 3 (n = 62, 56.36%, older NPcA) consisted mostly of
 older patients with long disease duration, adult-onset airway symptoms, less
 atopy, more noneosinophilic airway phenotypes, and prior sinus surgery
 history. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NPcA with 3 distinct natural courses had
 different inflammatory status and disease severity. Determining the natural
 course of a patient might help clinicians predict the clinical aspects of
 NPcA and contribute to phenotype-guided management approaches in the future.",
