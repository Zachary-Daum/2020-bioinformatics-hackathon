    abstract "Primary mediastinal germ cell tumors are uncommon tumors that
 can pose diagnostic difficulties due to their morphologic spectrum and
 unusual site. Immunohistochemistry plays an increasing role in the diagnosis
 of these tumors. Whereas the immunophenotype of testicular yolk sac tumors
 (YST) is rather well known, the opposite is true for primary mediastinal YST
 leading us to investigate the immunohistochemical features of 14 such
 neoplasms. Fourteen cases of primary mediastinal YST were reviewed and
 representative whole tissue sections were selected for immunohistochemical
 analysis using antibodies directed against CAM5.2, SALL4, OCT3/4, glypican-3,
 CD30, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), CD117, placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP),
 GATA-3, and CDX2. The percentage of positive tumor cells and the intensity of
 staining were evaluated and scored. All cases (100%) showed strong and
 diffuse expression of CAM5.2 and SALL4, 10 cases (71%) reacted with
 glypican-3 and AFP in a patchy manner, 5 cases (36%) showed focal positivity
 with PLAP and GATA-3, 4 cases (29%) showed staining for CDX2, 3 (21%) showed
 expression of CD117, and a single case was positive for CD30 (7%). None of
 the cases showed any staining for OCT3/4. Primary mediastinal YST appear to
 have a similar immunohistochemical phenotype as their testicular
 counterparts. Coexpression of CAM5.2, SALL4, glypican-3, and AFP provides the
 best support for YST differentiation; however, it has to be noted that none
 of these markers is specific for these tumors and immunohistochemical results
 will always have to be interpreted in the context of morphologic, clinical,
 and radiologic information.",
