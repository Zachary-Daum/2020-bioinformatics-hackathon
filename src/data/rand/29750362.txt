    abstract "BACKGROUND: While there is a substantial literature on the
 efficacy of brief motivational intervention (BMI) for college student
 drinkers, research has focused less on young adults who do not attend a
 4-year college, despite their elevated risk for excessive alcohol use and
 associated harmful consequences. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial
 (NCT01546025) compared the efficacy of BMI to a time-matched attention
 control intervention (relaxation training [REL]) for reducing alcohol
 consumption and related negative consequences in an underage young adult
 sample. BMI was tailored to the developmental transition out of high school
 for young adults who were not immediately planning to enroll in a 4-year
 college. Non-treatment-seeking underage drinkers who reported past-month
 heavy drinking (N = 167; ages 17 to 20; 42% female; 59% non-Hispanic White)
 were randomly assigned to receive a single session of BMI or REL. Outcomes
 were evaluated 6 weeks and 3 months postintervention via in-person
 assessments. RESULTS: Generalized estimating equation models provided strong
 support for the efficacy of BMI for reducing harmful drinking in these young
 adults. Compared to REL, and after controlling for baseline covariates
 including gender, those who received BMI subsequently reported significantly
 fewer average drinks per week, percent drinking days, percent heavy drinking
 days, lower peak and typical estimated blood alcohol concentration on
 drinking days, and fewer adverse consequences of drinking (all ps < 0.05).
 These between-group effects did not weaken over the course of the 3-month
 follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate an efficacious
 approach to tailoring BMI for non-college-attending young adults. Future
 research should replicate and extend these findings over a longer follow-up
 period.",
