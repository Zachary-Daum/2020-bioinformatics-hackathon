    abstract "ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are applied in a wide variety of
 applications and frequently accumulate in the environment, thus posing risks
 to the environment and human health. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (AMF)
 associate symbiotically with roots of most higher plants, helping their host
 plants acquire phosphorus (P). AMF can reduce the toxicity of ZnO NPs, but
 the benefits of AMF to host plants highly vary with soil available P. We
 hypothesize that organic P may help AMF to alleviate ZnO NP phytotoxicity.
 Here, we investigated the effects of inoculation with Funneliformis mosseae
 on plant growth and Zn accumulation, using maize grown in soil-sand mix
 substrates spiked with ZnO NPs (0 or 500 mg kg(-1)) under different organic P
 supply levels (0, 20, or 50 mg kg(-1)). The results showed addition of ZnO
 NPs inhibited root colonization rate, increased the shoot/root P
 concentration ratio, and led to significant Zn accumulation in soil and
 plants. As predicted, AM effects on maize plants all varied with P supply
 levels, both with or without ZnO NP additions. Organic P interacted
 synergistically with AMF to promote plant growth and acquisition of P, N, K,
 Fe, and Cu. AM inoculation reduced the bioavailable Zn released from ZnO NPs
 and decreased the concentrations and translocation of Zn to maize shoots. In
 conclusion, ZnO NPs caused excess Zn in soil and plants, posing potential
 environmental risks. However, our present results first demonstrate that
 organic P exhibited similar positive effects to AMF and interacted
 synergistically with AMF to improve plant growth and nutrition, and to
 decrease Zn accumulation and partitioning in plants, and thus helped diminish
 the adverse effects induced by ZnO NPs.",
