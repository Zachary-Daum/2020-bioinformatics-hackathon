    abstract "During the preclinical research period of drug development,
 animal testing is widely used to help screen out a drug's dangerous side
 effects. However, it remains difficult to predict side effects within the
 central nervous system. Here, we introduce a machine learning-based in vitro
 system designed to detect seizure-inducing side effects before clinical
 trial. We recorded local field potentials from the CA1 alveus in acute mouse
 neocortico-hippocampal slices that were bath-perfused with each of 14
 different drugs, and at 5 different concentrations of each drug. For each of
 these experimental conditions, we collected seizure-like neuronal activity
 and merged their waveforms as one graphic image, which was further converted
 into a feature vector using Caffe, an open framework for deep learning. In
 the space of the first two principal components, the support vector machine
 completely separated the vectors (i.e., doses of individual drugs) that
 induced seizure-like events, and identified diphenhydramine, enoxacin,
 strychnine and theophylline as ""seizure-inducing"" drugs, which have indeed
 been reported to induce seizures in clinical situations. Thus, this
 artificial intelligence-based classification may provide a new platform to
 pre-clinically detect seizure-inducing side effects of drugs.",
