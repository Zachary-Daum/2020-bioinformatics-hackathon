    abstract "BACKGROUND: The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac
 has been associated with intestinal anastomotic leakage, although the
 underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Previous data suggest that
 reactivation of biliary diclofenac metabolites by microbial
 beta-glucuronidases in the gut plays a role in harming the intestinal mucosa,
 and that microbiome-targeted glucuronidase inhibition prevents this damage.
 Here, the microbial glucuronidase inhibitor Inh1 was examined for its ability
 to reduce diclofenac-induced anastomotic leakage in rats. METHODS: Ninety
 male Wistar rats were allocated to five groups. In the two diclofenac groups,
 group DCF received diclofenac (3 mg/kg per day) and group DCF-Inh1
 additionally received 800 mcg/kg per day of glucuronidase inhibitor Inh1
 solution orally. In non-diclofenac groups, animals received either Inh1 (800
 mcg/kg per day; group Inh1) solution, the vehicle (methylcellulose; group
 Veh), or no solution (group Ctrl). All solutions were provided from the day
 of surgery until sacrifice on day three. Plasma concentrations of diclofenac
 were determined. Outcomes were anastomotic leakage, leak severity, and
 anastomotic strength. RESULTS: Anastomotic leak rates were 89% in group DCF
 and 44% in group DCF-Inh1 (p = 0.006). Leak severity was reduced in group
 DCFic-Inh1 (p = 0.029). In non-diclofenac cohorts, mostly minor leakage signs
 were observed in 25% in group Ctrl, 39% in group Inh1 (0.477), and 24% in
 group Veh (p = 1.000). Bursting pressure and breaking strength were not
 significantly different. Plasma concentrations of diclofenac were not changed
 by Inh1. CONCLUSION: Microbial glucuronidase inhibitor reduces
 diclofenac-induced anastomotic leakage severity, which suggests a harmful
 effect of diclofenac metabolite reactivation in the gut. This finding
 improves the understanding of the pathogenesis of anastomotic leakage.",
