    abstract "In our study, we report on the design and characterization of a
 combined angiogenesis therapy for breast cancer based on well-formed
 amine-functionalized silica nanoparticles (SLNs). The aminefunctionalized
 SLNs was employed to simultaneously deliver angiostatin (ANG) plasmid and
 candesartan (CD) to the same cancer cell. The well-formed ANG/CD/SLNs
 exhibited small particle size, reasonable positive charges, excellent loading
 of drug and gene in vitro. Moreover, aminefunctionalized SLNs were almost no
 cytotoxicity. ANG/CD/SLNs resulted in enhanced gene transfection compared to
 naked plasmid. More importantly, ANG/CD/SLNs as a co-delivery system achieved
 a stronger inhibitory effect on angiogenesis in vitro, possibly resulting
 from significant downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
 expression via different pathways. In particular, in vivo investigation on
 nude mice bearing MCF-7 xenografts confirmed that ANG/CD/SLNs codelivery
 system exerted strong anti-tumor efficacy by synergistic antiangiogenic
 mechanism.",
