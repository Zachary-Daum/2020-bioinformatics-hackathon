    abstract "1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD)-producing
 endophytic Streptomyces sp. GMKU 336 and its ACCD-deficient mutant were
 inoculated into Thai jasmine rice Khao Dok Mali 105 cultivar (Oryza sativa L.
 cv. KDML105) under salt stress (150 mM NaCl) conditions. The results clearly
 indicated that Streptomyces sp. GMKU 336 significantly increased plant
 growth, chlorophyll, proline, K(+), Ca(+), and water contents; but decreased
 ethylene, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Na(+), and Na(+)/K(+) ratio when
 compared to plants not inoculated and those inoculated with the
 ACCD-deficient mutant. Expression profiles of stress responsive genes in rice
 in association with strain GMKU 336 were correlated to plant physiological
 characteristics. Genes involved in the ethylene pathway, ACO1 and EREBP1,
 were significantly down-regulated; while acdS encoding ACCD in Streptomyces
 sp. GMKU 336 was up-regulated in vivo. Furthermore, genes involved in osmotic
 balance (BADH1), Na(+) transporters (NHX1 and SOS1), calmodulin (Cam1-1), and
 antioxidant enzymes (CuZn-SOD1 and CATb) were up-regulated; whereas, a gene
 implicated in a signaling cascade, MAPK5, was down-regulated. This work
 demonstrates the first time that ACCD-producing Streptomyces sp. GMKU 336
 enhances growth of rice and increases salt tolerance by reduction of ethylene
 via the action of ACCD and further assists plants to scavenge ROS, balance
 ion content and osmotic pressure.",
