    abstract "BACKGROUND: Early revascularisation of the culprit lesion is the
 therapeutic cornerstone in cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial
 infarction. The optimal management of additional non-culprit lesions is
 unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarise current
 evidence on the comparison of immediate multivessel percutaneous coronary
 intervention (MV-PCI) or culprit lesion only PCI with possible staged
 revascularisation (C-PCI) in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating
 acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: Medical literature databases were
 screened to identify analyses comparing MV-PCI with C-PCI in patients with
 cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction and multivessel
 coronary artery disease. In absence of randomised trials, 10 cohort studies
 were included in the current meta-analysis. The primary outcome of short-term
 mortality was assessed at hospital discharge or 30 days after hospital
 admission. Secondary outcomes were long-term mortality as well as myocardial
 re-infarction, stroke, acute renal failure, and bleeding at short-term
 follow-up. RESULTS: Of 6051 patients, 1194 (19.7%) received MV-PCI and 4857
 (80.3%) C-PCI. Short-term mortality was 37.5% in patients undergoing MV-PCI
 compared with 28.8% in C-PCI patients (risk ratio 1.26, 95% confidence
 interval 1.12-1.41, p=0.001). Long-term mortality ( p=0.77), myocardial
 re-infarction ( p=0.77), stroke ( p=0.12), acute renal failure ( p=0.17) and
 bleeding ( p=0.53) did not differ significantly between the two
 revascularisation groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this first meta-analysis on
 the interventional management of patients with cardiogenic shock complicating
 acute myocardial infarction and multivessel coronary artery disease do not
 support MV-PCI over C-PCI. However, possible treatment selection bias in the
 individual studies must be taken into account.",
