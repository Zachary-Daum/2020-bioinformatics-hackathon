    abstract "BACKGROUND: Chronic disease management (CDM) is an approach to
 health care that keeps people as healthy as possible through the prevention,
 early detection and management of chronic diseases. The aim of this study was
 to develop interventions to improve management of chronic diseases in the
 form of an integrated, evidence-based chronic disease management model in
 Dikgale, a rural area of Limpopo Province in South Africa. METHODS: A
 multifaceted intervention, called 'quality circles' (QCs) was developed to
 improve the quality and the management of chronic diseases in the Dikgale
 Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). These QCs used the
 findings from previous studies which formed part of the larger project in the
 study area, namely, the quantitative study using STEPwise survey and
 qualitative studies using focus group discussions and semi-structured
 interviews. RESULTS: The findings from previous studies in Dikgale HDSS
 revealed that an epidemiological transition is occurring. Again, the most
 widely reported barriers from previous studies in this rural area were: lack
 of knowledge of NCDs; shortages of medication and shortages of nurses in the
 clinics, which results in patients having long waiting-time at clinics. Lack
 of training of health care providers on the management of chronic diseases
 and the lack of supervision by the district and provincial health managers,
 together with poor dissemination of guidelines, were contributing factors to
 the lack of knowledge of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) management among
 nurses and community health care workers (CHWs). Consideration of all of
 these findings led to the development of model which focuses on integrating
 nursing services, CHWs and traditional health practitioners (THPs), including
 a well-established clinical information system for health care providers. A
 novel aspect of the model is the inclusion of community ambassadors who are
 on treatment for NCDs and are, thus, repositories of knowledge who can serve
 as a bridge between health care workers and community members. CONCLUSION:
 The model developed highlights the need for health interventions that aim to
 control risk factors at the population level, the need for availability of
 NCD-trained nurses, functional equipment and medication and a need to improve
 the link with traditional healers.",
