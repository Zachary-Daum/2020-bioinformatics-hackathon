    abstract "Monocytes emerging from the bone marrow are the progenitors of
 monocyte-derived macrophages. An essential function of monocytes is to seed
 tissues with sufficient macrophages to replace loss from infection and tissue
 damage. Recent work from diverse inflammatory and homeostatic settings has
 shown monocytes also possess direct protective and pathogenic activities.
 Thus, monocytes are not simply needed to generate macrophages, but instead
 contribute to the overall orchestration of immunity. Some recently described
 properties of monocytes are both surprising and mechanistically specific; for
 example, inflammatory monocytes are required for the efficacy of transferred
 activated cytotoxic T cells, but can have potent tissue damaging effects
 while patrolling monocytes are required for anti-tumor immunity in some
 cases, but in another example provokes resistance to chemotherapy and thereby
 aid tumor growth. This summary will therefore focus on new findings about the
 regulatory activities of monocytes themselves.",
