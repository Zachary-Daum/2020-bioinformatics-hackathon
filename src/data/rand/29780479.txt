    abstract "Emissive base analogs are powerful tools for probing nucleic
 acids at the molecular level. Herein we describe the development and thorough
 characterization of pentacyclic adenine (pA), a versatile base analog with
 exceptional fluorescence properties. When incorporated into DNA, pA pairs
 selectively with thymine without perturbing the B-form structure and is among
 the brightest nucleobase analogs reported so far. Together with the recently
 established base analog acceptor qAnitro, pA allows accurate distance and
 orientation determination via Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
 measurements. The high brightness at emission wavelengths above 400 nm also
 makes it suitable for fluorescence microscopy, as demonstrated by imaging of
 single liposomal constructs coated with cholesterol-anchored pA-dsDNA, using
 total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Finally, pA is also highly
 promising for two-photon excitation at 780 nm, with a brightness (5.3 GM)
 that is unprecedented for a base analog.",
