    abstract "Health systems across the nation are recovering from massive
 financial and resource investments in electronic health record applications.
 In the midst of these recovery efforts, implementations of new care models,
 including accountable care organizations and population health initiatives,
 are underway. The shift from fee-for-service to fee-for-outcomes and
 fee-for-value payment models calls for care providers to work in new ways. It
 also changes how physicians are compensated and reimbursed. These changes
 necessitate that healthcare systems further invest in information technology
 solutions. Selecting which information technology (IT) projects are of most
 value is vital, especially in light of recent expenditures.
 Return-on-investment analysis is a powerful tool used in various industries
 to select the most appropriate IT investments. It has proven vital in
 selecting, justifying, and implementing software projects. Other financial
 metrics, such as net present value, economic value added, and total economic
 impact, also quantify the success of expenditures on information systems.
 This paper extends the concept of quantifying project value to include
 clinical outcomes and nonfinancial value as investment returns, applying a
 systematic approach to healthcare software projects. We term this inclusive
 approach Value of Investment. It offers a necessary extension for application
 in clinical settings where a strictly financial view may fall short in
 providing a complete picture of important benefits. This paper outlines the
 Value of Investment process and its attributes, and uses illustrative
 examples to explore the efficacy of this methodology within a midsized health
 system.",
