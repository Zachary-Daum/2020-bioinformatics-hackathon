    abstract "Alcohol exposure can affect brain development, leading to
 long-lasting behavioral problems, including cognitive impairment, which
 together is defined as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). However, the
 fundamental mechanisms through which this occurs are largely unknown. In this
 study, we report that the exposure of postnatal day 7 (P7) mice to ethanol
 activates caspase-3 via cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1R) in neonatal mice
 and causes a reduction in methylated DNA binding protein (MeCP2) levels. The
 developmental expression of MeCP2 in mice is closely correlated with
 synaptogenesis and neuronal maturation. It was shown that ethanol treatment
 of P7 mice enhanced Mecp2 mRNA levels but reduced protein levels. The genetic
 deletion of CB1R prevented, and administration of a CB1R antagonist before
 ethanol treatment of P7 mice inhibited caspase-3 activation. Additionally, it
 reversed the loss of MeCP2 protein, cAMP response element binding protein
 (CREB) activation, and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein
 (Arc) expression. The inhibition of caspase-3 activity prior to ethanol
 administration prevented ethanol-induced loss of MeCP2, CREB activation,
 epigenetic regulation of Arc expression, long-term potentiation (LTP),
 spatial memory deficits and activity-dependent impairment of several
 signaling molecules, including MeCP2, in adult mice. Collectively, these
 results reveal that the ethanol-induced CB1R-mediated activation of caspase-3
 degrades the MeCP2 protein in the P7 mouse brain and causes long-lasting
 neurobehavioral deficits in adult mice. This CB1R-mediated instability of
 MeCP2 during active synaptic maturation may disrupt synaptic circuit
 maturation and lead to neurobehavioral abnormalities, as observed in this
 animal model of FASD.",
