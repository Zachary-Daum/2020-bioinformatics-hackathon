    abstract "DIMITRA (dentomaxillofacial paediatric imaging: an investigation
 towards low-dose radiation induced risks) is a European multicenter and
 multidisciplinary project focused on optimizing cone-beam CT exposures for
 children and adolescents. With increasing use of cone-beam CT for
 dentomaxillofacial diagnostics, concern arises regarding radiation risks
 associated with this imaging modality, especially for children. Research
 evidence concerning cone-beam CT indications in children remains limited,
 while reports mention inconsistent recommendations for dose reduction.
 Furthermore, there is no paper using the combined and integrated information
 on the required indication-oriented image quality and the related patient
 dose levels. In this paper, therefore, the authors initiate an integrated
 approach based on current evidence regarding image quality and dose, together
 with the expertise of DIMITRA's members searching for a state of the art. The
 aim of this DIMITRA position statement is to provide indication-oriented and
 patient-specific recommendations regarding the main cone-beam CT applications
 in the pediatric field. The authors will review this position statement
 document when results regarding multidisciplinary approaches evolve, in a
 period of 5 years or earlier.",
