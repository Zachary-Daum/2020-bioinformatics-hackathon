    abstract "Several investigations have revealed that liver diseases exhibit
 gender biases, but identifying the root causes of such biases has been
 challenging. Evidence of gender differences in liver function is present from
 the early stage of embryonic development. The differences in access to care
 and treatment as well as diagnostic deliberation may affect gender-specific
 differences in liver disease progression. Apart from the pathogenesis,
 xenobiotic metabolism, immune responses, gene expressions, mitochondrial
 function, lipid composition, and enzyme activities also differ in this
 sexually dimorphic organ. Differences in a social environment and lifestyle
 of men and women may also be involved in the basic mechanisms underlying the
 sex-associated differences and protective or aggravating effects of sex
 hormones during viral infections, alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic and/or
 acute mode of liver injuries, carcinogenesis, autoimmune responses, and liver
 transplantation outcome. We summarized here the recent findings regarding the
 influence of sex hormones on immune responses underlying the pathology of the
 liver diseases in humans and animal models.",
