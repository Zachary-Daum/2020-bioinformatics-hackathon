    abstract "AIM: To ascertain performance against the standards set by
 National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on physical
 health monitoring of thirty children and adolescents prescribed
 antipsychotics in neurodevelopmental clinics in Northumberland and
 identifying areas for improvement in practice. METHODS: The audit involved a
 review of recorded documentation pertaining to physical health monitoring in
 patient electronic records pertaining to children and adolescents attending
 neurodevelopmental clinics in Northumberland prescribed antipsychotics.
 Clients were also contacted by telephone if relevant documentation could not
 be identified or retrieved to confirm the details. 32 case notes were perused
 of which 2 were excluded as they had refused to have venepuncture which was
 documented in the electronic records. RESULTS: The overall audit results
 demonstrated partial compliance with NICE guidelines on physical health
 monitoring in children and adolescents prescribed antipsychotics. Bi-annual
 recording of height, weight, blood pressure, pulse rate and review of side
 effects was completed in 100% of subjects. However, annual monitoring for
 blood tests including liver function, renal function full blood count as well
 as biannual monitoring of serum prolactin, serum lipid profile was completed
 only in 56% of subjects. Comparative baseline characteristics between the two
 groups (compliant and non-compliant with guidelines) found no differences
 based on any socio-demographic or clinical variables. However, the proportion
 of patients in the group compliant to guidelines was higher in the age group
 of 12-17 years as compared to < 12 years (70.58% vs 38.46%), though not
 statistically significant (chi(2) = 1.236; P = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Development
 of tailored and specific guidelines for physical health monitoring in
 children and adolescents prescribed antipsychotics taking into consideration
 clinical effectiveness and safety profile is likely to improve adherence
 rates.",
