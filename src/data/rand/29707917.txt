    abstract "Studies reporting tick infection rates for Powassan virus
 (POWV), an emerging zoonotic arthropod-borne pathogen responsible for POWV
 disease in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, are limited. To determine the
 presence and ascertain a statewide prevalence of POWV, ticks were collected
 from 9,912 hunter-harvested white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) heads
 presented to six regional Pennsylvania Game Commission Chronic Wasting
 Disease sampling stations in early December of 2013, 2014 and 2015. Of the
 2,973 ticks recovered, 1,990 (66.9%) were identified as adult Ixodes
 scapularis (black-legged tick). The 1,990 I. scapularis ticks were PCR-tested
 for the presence of POWV. The ticks had a statewide Powassan/deer tick virus
 infection rate of 0.05%, providing evidence of this pathogen in Pennsylvania
's adult I. scapularis ticks and supporting the need for more comprehensive
 pathogen prevalence assessment strategies, as well as increased public health
 awareness for this emerging zoonotic arthropod-borne pathogen of public
 health concern.",
