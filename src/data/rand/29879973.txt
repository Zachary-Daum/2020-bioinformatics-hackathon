    abstract "BACKGROUND: Cases of diverticula of the buccal mucosa are
 extremely rare. Literature searches of databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE for
 this condition have revealed only 10 case reports. In this case report, we
 describe our experience in the management of this rare condition and review
 the previous 10 previously reported cases. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old
 man presented with a pouch containing inspissated food debris located
 posterior to the papilla of the parotid duct in his left buccal mucosa. The
 diagnosis of a diverticulum arising from the buccal mucosa was confirmed
 based on clinical and radiographic findings. Gross examination of the locally
 resected tissue specimen revealed a pouch measuring 14 mm in diameter and 8
 mm in depth, that was whitish in color and had an elastic, soft, and smooth
 surface. Microscopic examination revealed a cyst-like lesion lined by
 stratified squamous epithelium and granulation tissue, with a chronic
 inflammatory infiltration in the peripheral stromal tissue of the epithelial
 layer. After surgical excision of the lesion, there was no recurrence during
 the follow-up period of 5 years and 10 months. CONCLUSIONS: We have presented
 a rare case of a diverticulum of the buccal mucosa. This is the first report
 of a case confirmed not only by the clinicopathological findings, but also by
 computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings. From the
 magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative findings, we inferred that the
 diverticulum was caused by an idiopathic developmental anomaly due to a
 partial defect of the buccinator muscle.",
