    abstract "Worldwide there is a rush toward wind power development and its
 associated infrastructure. In Fennoscandia, large-scale wind farms comprising
 several hundred windmills are currently built in important grazing ranges
 used for Sami reindeer husbandry. In this study, reindeer habitat use was
 assessed using reindeer fecal pellet group counts in relation to two
 relatively small wind farms, with 8 and 10 turbines, respectively. In 2009,
 1,315 15-m(2) plots were established and pellet groups were counted and
 cleaned from the plots. This was repeated once a year in May, during
 preconstruction, construction, and operation of the wind farms, covering 6
 years (2009-2014) of reindeer habitat use in the area. We modeled the
 presence/absence of any pellets in a plot at both the local (wind farm site)
 and regional (reindeer calving to autumn range) scale with a hierarchical
 logistic regression, where spatial correlation was accounted for via random
 effects, using vegetation type, and the interaction between distance to wind
 turbine and time period as predictor variables. Our results revealed an
 absolute reduction in pellet groups by 66% and 86% around each wind farm,
 respectively, at local scale and by 61% at regional scale during the
 operation phase compared to the preconstruction phase. At the regional, scale
 habitat use declined close to the turbines in the same comparison. However,
 at the local scale, we observed increased habitat use close to the wind
 turbines at one of the wind farms during the operation phase. This may be
 explained by continued use of an important migration route close to the wind
 farm. The reduced use at the regional scale nevertheless suggests that there
 may be an overall avoidance of both wind farms during operation, but further
 studies of reindeer movement and behavior are needed to gain a better
 understanding of the mechanisms behind this suggested avoidance.",
