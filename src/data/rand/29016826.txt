    abstract "Background: Work-related stressors, including role ambiguity and
 role conflict, are related to psychological maladjustment and mental
 ill-health. However, to date, the role of personal resources such as
 emotion-regulation ability (ERA) in the prediction of mental health
 indicators has not been addressed. Aims: To examine whether ERA would
 contribute to explaining teachers' depression, anxiety and stress symptoms
 beyond role ambiguity and role conflict. Methods: We carried out a
 cross-sectional questionnaire survey. We used a correlation matrix and
 hierarchical regression models to analyse the data. Results: Three hundred
 and thirty-six Spanish teachers (185 female) from several grade levels
 completed the surveys (40% response rate). Role ambiguity and role conflict
 were positively related to depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. ERA was
 negatively related to teachers' scores on depressive, anxious and stress
 symptoms, with predictive power above the main effects of role ambiguity and
 role conflict. An interaction between role ambiguity and ERA was also
 significant in predicting depression. Conclusions: Our study provides
 preliminary evidence suggesting the development of integrative models
 considering work-related stressors along with personal resources such as ERA
 aiming to prevent teachers' mental ill-health. Future studies should examine
 the influence of ERA on psychological symptoms using longitudinal designs.",
