    abstract "DFT methods including B3LYP, B3PW91 and M05-2x associated to
 6-31+G(d,p) were used for the structural and antioxidant potency studies of
 phenylethyl-3,4-dihydroxy-hydrocinnamate (PDH). Solvents were employed
 according to their protric and aprotic character. So, calculated structures
 agree with the experimental data. O4H4 is propitious to scavenge radicals
 whatever the medium except in water where O3H3 and O4H4 are competitive. The
 explicit solvents of dichloromethane (DCM) and water present a disparity of
 OH bond dissociation enthalpy and free energy (BDE and BDFE). These
 parameters are low in continuum except in water. The ionization potentials
 (IP) and potential affinities (PA) are low in solvents. BDE, IP and PA are
 each, approximatively constant in mixed solvent treatment in water using
 n-H2O (n=3,5,8). Elsewhere, H-atom transfer (HAT) mechanism is favoured in
 vacuum and DCM, whereas sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET) is
 likely in protic solvents. A discord between HAT and SPLET in benzene is
 observed. The PDH compound is more antioxidant and resistant to oxidation
 than caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE). The potential of scavenging of OH
 and OOH whatever the reaction channel shows that they decay rapidly in any
 media through HAT. PDH is easily deprotonated in the protic solvents and the
 resulting product is the most antioxidant and the least resistant to
 oxidation.",
