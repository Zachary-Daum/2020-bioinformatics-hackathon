    abstract "PURPOSE: The severity of white matter lesions (WML) is a risk
 factor of hemorrhage and predictor of clinical outcome after ischemic stroke;
 however, in contrast to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reliable
 quantification for this surrogate marker is limited for computed tomography
 (CT), the leading stroke imaging technique. We aimed to present and evaluate
 a CT-based automated rater-independent method for quantification of
 microangiopathic white matter changes. METHODS: Patients with suspected minor
 stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke scale, NIHSS < 4) were screened
 for the analysis of non-contrast computerized tomography (NCCT) at admission
 and compared to follow-up MRI. The MRI-based WML volume and visual Fazekas
 scores were assessed as the gold standard reference. We employed a recently
 published probabilistic brain segmentation algorithm for CT images to
 determine the tissue-specific density of WM space. All voxel-wise densities
 were quantified in WM space and weighted according to partial probabilistic
 WM content. The resulting mean weighted density of WM space in NCCT, the
 surrogate of WML, was correlated with reference to MRI-based WML parameters.
 RESULTS: The process of CT-based tissue-specific segmentation was reliable in
 79 cases with varying severity of microangiopathy. Voxel-wise weighted
 density within WM spaces showed a noticeable correlation (r = -0.65) with
 MRI-based WML volume. Particularly in patients with moderate or severe lesion
 load according to the visual Fazekas score the algorithm provided reliable
 prediction of MRI-based WML volume. CONCLUSION: Automated
 observer-independent quantification of voxel-wise WM density in CT
 significantly correlates with microangiopathic WM disease in gold standard
 MRI. This rapid surrogate of white matter lesion load in CT may support
 objective WML assessment and therapeutic decision-making during acute stroke
 triage.",
