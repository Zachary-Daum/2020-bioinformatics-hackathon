    abstract "BACKGROUND: Ossabaw pigs are unique miniature swine with genetic
 predisposition to develop metabolic syndrome and coronary atherosclerosis
 after extended periods receiving atherogenic diets. We have hypothesized that
 transgenic Ossabaw swine expressing chimp PCSK9 (proprotein convertase
 subtilisin-like/kexin type 9) containing the D374Y gain of function would
 develop familial hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery plaques more
 rapidly than Landrace swine with the same transgene. METHODS AND RESULTS:
 Ossabaw and Landrace PCSK9 gain-of-function founders were generated by
 Sleeping Beauty transposition and cloning. Histopathologic findings in the
 Ossabaw founder animal showed more advanced plaques and higher stenosis than
 in the Landrace founder, underscoring the Ossabaw genetic predisposition to
 atherosclerosis. We chose to further characterize the Ossabaw PCSK9
 gain-of-function animals receiving standard or atherogenic diets in a 6-month
 longitudinal study using computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR)
 imaging, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography, followed
 by pathological analysis of atherosclerosis focused on the coronary arteries.
 The Ossabaw model was consistently hypercholesterolemic, with or without
 dietary challenge, and by 6 months had consistent and diffuse fibrofatty or
 fibroatheromatous plaques with necrosis, overlying fibrous caps, and
 calcification in up to 10% of coronary plaques. CONCLUSIONS: The Ossabaw
 PCSK9 gain-of-function model provides consistent and robust disease
 development in a time frame that is practical for use in preclinical
 therapeutic evaluation to drive innovation. Although no animal model
 perfectly mimics the human condition, this genetic large-animal model is a
 novel tool for testing therapeutic interventions in the context of developing
 and advanced coronary artery disease.",
