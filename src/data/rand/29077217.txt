    abstract "Myofibromas are unusual benign tumors most commonly seen in
 infant children. Clinical involution of the tumor often occurs within the
 first few years of life. Solitary cutaneous myofibroma is the synonymous
 adult counterpart of infantile myofibromatosis. Although solitary myofibromas
 have been reported in patients of all ages, only the infantile variant is
 believed to regress spontaneously. There are only a few case reports of
 adolescent and young adult patients with regressing solitary lesions that
 have been described in the literature to date. We report a 71-year-old male
 with spontaneous regression of solitary cutaneous myofibroma. The residual
 lesion was excised and to date has not recurred. This report describes the
 historical, clinical and histopathological features of adult myofibromas and
 a novel manifestation that may guide future clinical considerations when
 approaching solitary tumors with regressive features.",
