    abstract "Objective: We performed a retrospective case-control study of
 vaginal delivery at term without epidural anesthesia to identify clinical
 predictions of postpartum urinary retention (PUR). Methods: We reviewed the
 obstetric records of all singleton vaginal deliveries at Japanese Red Cross,
 Katsushika Maternity Hospital form January 2016 through December 2017.
 Results: There were 58 women (2.4%) complicated by PUR and 2391 women without
 PUR. A multivariate analysis revealed nulliparity, instrumental delivery, and
 episiotomy as independent risk factors for PUR (nulliparity: adjusted OR
 2.39, 95%CI 1.2-4.8, p = 0.01; instrumental delivery: 3.53, 95%CI 1.9-6.7, p
 < .01, episiotomy: adjusted OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.0-3.8, p = .04). While,
 urination (or urethral catheterization) within 1 hour before delivery
 revealed as independent prevention factor for PUR (adjusted OR 0.54, 95%CI
 0.30-0.99, p = .048). Conclusions: The risk factors identified in our
 institute seemed to approximately similar to those observed in the institutes
 capable of performing epidural anesthesia. In addition, urination just before
 delivery seemed to be an independent prevention factor for PUR.",
