    abstract "BACKGROUND: Lack of agreement about criteria and terminology for
 children's language problems affects access to services as well as hindering
 research and practice. We report the second phase of a study using an online
 Delphi method to address these issues. In the first phase, we focused on
 criteria for language disorder. Here we consider terminology. METHODS: The
 Delphi method is an iterative process in which an initial set of statements
 is rated by a panel of experts, who then have the opportunity to view
 anonymised ratings from other panel members. On this basis they can either
 revise their views or make a case for their position. The statements are then
 revised based on panel feedback, and again rated by and commented on by the
 panel. In this study, feedback from a second round was used to prepare a
 final set of statements in narrative form. The panel included 57 individuals
 representing a range of professions and nationalities. RESULTS: We achieved
 at least 78% agreement for 19 of 21 statements within two rounds of ratings.
 These were collapsed into 12 statements for the final consensus reported
 here. The term 'Language Disorder' is recommended to refer to a profile of
 difficulties that causes functional impairment in everyday life and is
 associated with poor prognosis. The term, 'Developmental Language Disorder'
 (DLD) was endorsed for use when the language disorder was not associated with
 a known biomedical aetiology. It was also agreed that (a) presence of risk
 factors (neurobiological or environmental) does not preclude a diagnosis of
 DLD, (b) DLD can co-occur with other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. ADHD)
 and (c) DLD does not require a mismatch between verbal and nonverbal ability.
 CONCLUSIONS: This Delphi exercise highlights reasons for disagreements about
 terminology for language disorders and proposes standard definitions and
 nomenclature.",
