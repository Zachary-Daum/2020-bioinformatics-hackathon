    abstract "BACKGROUND: C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) includes both C3
 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and dense deposit disease (DDD) and is defined by
 C3-dominant deposits on immunofluorescence. Dysfunction of the alternative
 pathway (AP) of complement is central to the pathophysiology of C3G and young
 patients often harbor genetic alterations of AP mediators. Recently, a link
 between C3G and paraproteinemia has been established. We performed this study
 to better characterize older patients with C3G where this association is more
 frequently seen. METHODS: Fourteen biopsies from 12 patients meeting
 diagnostic criteria for C3G were identified in patients > 49 years of age
 from 2005 to 2015 after exclusion of cases containing masked monotypic
 immunoglobulin deposits. Pathologic and clinical features were reviewed.
 RESULTS: The median age was 63.5 years and 75% of patients were male. All had
 renal insufficiency at presentation. Kidney biopsy showed DDD in three
 patients and C3GN in the remainder. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a
 paraprotein in 10 patients, 8 of which had a plasma cell dyscrasia on bone
 marrow biopsy. A membranoproliferative pattern of glomerular injury was seen
 in 64% of biopsies, while mesangial proliferative and endocapillary
 proliferative patterns were seen less frequently. Among patients with at
 least 1 year of follow-up (n = 9), five were on renal replacement therapy,
 three showed stable (but impaired) kidney function and one demonstrated
 improvement. CONCLUSIONS: C3G is an uncommon but important cause of kidney
 injury in older adults and associates with a high prevalence of
 paraproteinemia. In adult patients with C3G, prognosis is guarded as most
 patients showed either progression to end-stage kidney disease or stable but
 impaired kidney function.",
