    abstract "OBJECTIVE: The study aims to estimate the future demand of hip
 arthroplasty for OECD countries and to compare the results with earlier
 studies. DESIGN: Based on data availability and validity 20 countries out of
 the OECD sample have been selected for projection analysis. Using historic
 data (1995-2012) and multiple linear regression technics a projection model
 was designed by an iterative process considering different explanatory
 variables such as health care expenditure, age groups, and projection time
 frames. RESULTS: The utilisation of hip implants in OECD countries continues
 to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.2%, leading to an
 increase from 1.8 million per year in 2015 to 2.8 (2.6-2.9) in the year 2050.
 The mean utilisation rate (incidence) of hip implants will increase from 184
 (143-312) to 275 (174-457) per 100.000 total population in the same time.
 Australia, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland and other countries will face a
 significant increase of utilisation of hip implants between +95% and +120%
 from 2015 to 2050. CONCLUSIONS: Hip arthroplasty continues to rise
 significantly over the next 35 years. Therefore, some countries will face an
 exponential use of hip arthroplasty of additional 100% or more and thus
 challenges for their health care budgets. Revision burden will increase
 disproportionately. Thus, health technology assessment (HTA) for medical
 devices, longevity and quality control will become more relevant.",
