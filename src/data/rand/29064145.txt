    abstract "BACKGROUND: Siblings of people with intellectual and
 developmental disabilities (IDD) often assume key roles to support their
 brothers and sisters. For people with more significant support needs,
 siblings may undertake additional roles and responsibilities throughout their
 lives. The purpose of the present study was to identify and describe the
 roles of adult siblings who have a brother or sister with severe IDD. METHOD:
 Seventy-nine adult siblings from 19 to 72 years of age completed an online
 survey with open-ended questions about the roles they play in their
 relationships with their brother or sister. RESULTS: Thematic analysis
 resulted in identification of several roles including caregiver, friend
 (social partner), advocate, legal representative, sibling (teacher/role
 model), leisure planner and informal service coordinator. CONCLUSION:
 Siblings assume key roles in the lives of people with IDD and need support
 from family and professionals to perform these roles.",
