    abstract "OBJECTIVE: This study leveraged a state workers' compensation
 claims database and machine learning techniques to target prevention efforts
 by injury causation and industry. METHODS: Injury causation auto-coding
 methods were developed to code more than 1.2 million Ohio Bureau of Workers'
 Compensation claims for this study. Industry groups were ranked for
 soft-tissue musculoskeletal claims that may have been preventable with
 biomechanical ergonomic (ERGO) or slip/trip/fall (STF) interventions.
 RESULTS: On the basis of the average of claim count and rate ranks for more
 than 200 industry groups, Skilled Nursing Facilities (ERGO) and General
 Freight Trucking (STF) were the highest risk for lost-time claims (>7 days).
 CONCLUSION: This study created a third, major causation-specific U.S.
 occupational injury surveillance system. These findings are being used to
 focus prevention resources on specific occupational injury types in specific
 industry groups, especially in Ohio. Other state bureaus or insurers may use
 similar methods.",
