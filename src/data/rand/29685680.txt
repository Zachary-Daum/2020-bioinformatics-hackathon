    abstract "Salicylic acid (SA), Epi-brassinolide (EBL) and calcium (Ca)
 play crucial roles in plant development and mediate plant response to biotic
 and abiotic stress. This study was aimed to investigate the possible
 mediatory role of SA, EBL, Ca or their combination in protecting tomato
 plants from cadmium (Cd) toxicity. According to the results, Cd stress
 resulted in a significant reduction of plant dry mass, photosynthetic pigment
 content as well as photosynthetic rate. Exogenous application of SA decreased
 the malondialdehyde (MDA) level by 39.27% and increased catalase (CAT)
 activity by 81.17%. SA and EBL treatment significantly increased chlorophyll
 a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b) content, photosynthetic rate (Pn) as well as
 water use efficiency (WUE). SA+EBL (1:1)/Ca+SA+EBL (1:1:1) treatment
 obviously alleviated Cd-induced growth inhibition, the dry mass of different
 tomato organs were significantly increased (p<0.05). Especially in Ca+SA+EBL
 treated plants, the dry mass of roots, stems and leaves increased by 141.18%,
 128.57% and 118.52%, respectively. Besides, SA+EBL and Ca+SA+EBL treatments
 reduced the MDA level, but increased photosynthetic pigment concentration and
 photosynthetic efficiency. CAT activity was increased by 62.92% in Ca+SA+EBL
 treated plants, the WUE was increased by 557.76% in SA+EBL pretreated plants.
 Moreover, exogenous application of SA, SA+EBL and Ca+SA+EBL significantly
 decreased Cd accumulation in tomato organs (p<0.05) compared with Cd-stressed
 plants. Taken together, our results indicated that exogenous application of
 SA, EBL and Ca individually or in combination could alleviate Cd toxicity in
 tomato plants, although the extent varies.",
