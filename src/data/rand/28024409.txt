    abstract "This study assessed the psychometric properties of the Arabic
 version of Exercise Self-Efficacy scale (ESE-A) among Jordanian outpatients
 with a variety of chronic diseases using descriptive cross-sectional design.
 Participants' scores of ESE-A significantly correlated with their reported
 weekly exercise frequency ( r = .23, p< .001), duration ( r = .31, p< .001),
 and evaluation of their physical exercise ( r = .39, p< .001). The construct
 validity was tested using exploratory factor analysis, which retained all
 items, and the scree plot showed one meaningful factor with an eigenvalue of
 10.38 and an explained variance of 57.7%. Furthermore, Cronbach's alpha was
 .89 and split-half coefficient was .83 indicating that the ESE-A is a
 reliable scale. The ESE-A was found to be a robust measure to evaluate
 exercise self-efficacy among Arabic patients with chronic diseases. Arabic
 researchers interested in exercise self-efficacy are invited to utilize the
 ESE-A in their studies to confirm its psychometric properties.",
