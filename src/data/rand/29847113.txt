    abstract "The selective detection of specific cells of interest and their
 effective visualization is important but challenging, and fluorescent cell
 imaging with target-specific probes is commonly used to visualize cell
 morphology and components and to track cellular processes. Multiple displays
 of two or more targeting ligands on a polyvalent single template would make
 it possible to construct versatile multiplex fluorescent cell imaging probes
 that can visualize two or more target cells individually without the need for
 a set of individual probes. To achieve this goal, we used encapsulin, a new
 class of protein cage nanoparticles, as a template and implanted dual
 targeting capability by presenting two different affibody molecules on a
 single encapsulin protein cage nanoparticle post-translationally. Encapsulin
 was self-assembled from 60 identical subunits to form a hollow and symmetric
 spherical structure with a uniform size. We genetically inserted SpyTag
 peptides onto the encapsulin surface and prepared various SpyCatcher-fused
 proteins, such as fluorescent proteins and targeting affibody molecules. We
 successfully displayed fluorescent proteins and affibody molecules together
 on a single encapsulin in a mix-and-match manner post-translationally using
 bacterial superglue, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher ligation system, and demonstrated
 that these dual functional encapsulins can be used as target-specific
 fluorescent cell imaging probes. Dual targeting protein cage nanoparticles
 were further constructed by ligating two different affibody molecules onto
 the encapsulin surface with fluorescent dyes, and they effectively recognized
 and bound to two individual targeting cells independently, which could be
 visualized by selective colors on demand.",
