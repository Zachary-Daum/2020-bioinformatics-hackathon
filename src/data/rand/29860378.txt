    abstract "Endosymbiotically originated chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) encodes
 part of the genetic information needed to fulfill chloroplast function,
 including fundamental processes such as photosynthesis. In the last two
 decades, advances in genome analysis led to the identification of a
 considerable number of cpDNA sequences from various species. While these data
 provided the consensus features of cpDNA organization and chloroplast
 evolution in plants, how cpDNA is maintained through development and is
 inherited remains to be fully understood. In particular, the fact that cpDNA
 exists as multiple copies despite its limited genetic capacity raises the
 important question of how copy number is maintained or whether cpDNA is
 subjected to quantitative fluctuation or even developmental degradation. For
 example, cpDNA is abundant in leaves, where it forms punctate structures
 called nucleoids, which seemingly alter their morphologies and numbers
 depending on the developmental status of the chloroplast. In this review, we
 summarize our current understanding of 'cpDNA dynamics', focusing on the
 changes in DNA abundance. A special focus is given to the cpDNA degradation
 mechanism, which appears to be mediated by Defective in Pollen organelle DNA
 degradation 1 (DPD1), a recently discovered organelle exonuclease. The
 physiological significance of cpDNA degradation in flowering plants is also
 discussed.",
