    abstract "OBJECTIVES: The ability of older adults to live independently is
 often assessed with a battery of questions known as Instrumental Activities
 of Daily Living (IADLs). Many of these questions query the difficulty
 conducting household activities that have been predominantly conducted by
 women (e.g., the ability to prepare a meal), especially for cohorts now in
 old age. Although previous research has documented gender differences in IADL
 limitations, it has not been documented whether IADLs equivalently measure
 the same latent construct for men and women. METHODS: We apply psychometric
 tests of measurement invariance to data from the 1998 Health and Retirement
 Study. We then estimate corrected models that account for violations of
 measurement invariance across genders. RESULTS: We find that IADLs do not
 equivalently measure same latent construct for men and women. We find that
 men are more likely not to do the IADL activities for reasons unrelated to
 health limitations, which may reflect gendered expectations regarding
 household activities. Accounting for this we still find that women report
 greater health-related IADL limitations than men. DISCUSSION: Researchers
 should be cautious making gender comparisons for IADLs without attending to
 the gender-specific measurement properties of many of the items of which the
 IADL is comprised.",
