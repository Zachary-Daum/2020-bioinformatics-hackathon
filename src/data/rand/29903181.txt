    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between SLC22A12 gene
 rs1529909 and rs7929627 polymorphism and hyperuricemia of residents in
 Yinchuan, Ningxia province. METHODS: Through retrospective analysis in
 healthy subjects from April to November in 2014, 365 patients with
 hyperuricemia were selected. 1ratio 1 matched casecontrol study was carried
 out, matched with age( +/- 5 years old), gender, race, and selected 365
 people with normal serum uric acid levels as the control group. All subjects
 were investigated by questionnaire, had a physical examination, and collected
 fastingvenous blood for biochemical markers and gene polymorphism detection.
 Paired t test was used to compare the mean of two samples, and the
 influencing factors were analyzed by conditional logistic regression. The
 interaction of two sites on hyperuricemia was analyzed by MDR software.
 RESULTS: The body mass index, blood uric acid, creatinine, total cholesterol
 and triglyceride in the case group were higher than those in the control
 group, the difference was statistically significant( P < 0. 05). There was a
 significant differences between male cases and control group in the allele
 frequency of rs1529909( chi~2= 4. 887, P = 0. 027). There had a significant
 difference in the frequency of rs7929627 between the Hui case and control
 group( chi~2= 14. 906, P = 0. 002), also a significant difference between the
 male case and control group( chi~2= 9. 749, P = 0. 021). Additionally,
 theresult of interaction analysis showed that the distribution of high risk
 and low risk genotype had a statistically significant difference( chi~2= 8.
 338, P = 0. 004). The risk of hyperuricemia with high genotype was 1. 536
 times of those who had low-risk genotypes( OR = 1. 536, 95% CI1. 147-2. 057).
 CONCLUSION: rs1529909 and rs7929627 were associated with hyperuricemia among
 men. rs7929627 was related to it in the Hui. There may be a strong
 antagonistic effect on hyperuricemia between rs1529909 and rs7929627.",
