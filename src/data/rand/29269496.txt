    abstract "Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica is found in North
 America and much of Europe and causes the disease tularemia in humans and
 animals. An aquatic cycle has been described for this subspecies, which has
 caused waterborne outbreaks of tularemia in at least 10 countries. In this
 study, we sought to identify the mechanosensitive channel(s) required for the
 bacterium to survive the transition from mammalian hosts to freshwater, which
 is likely essential for the transmission of the bacterium between susceptible
 hosts. A single 165-amino-acid MscS-type mechanosensitive channel (FtMscS)
 was found to protect F. tularensis subsp. holarctica from hypoosmotic shock,
 despite lacking much of the cytoplasmic vestibule domain found in
 well-characterized MscS proteins from other organisms. The deletion of this
 channel did not affect virulence within the mammalian host; however, FtMscS
 was required to survive the transition from the host niche to freshwater. The
 deletion of FtMscS did not alter the sensitivity of F. tularensis subsp.
 holarctica to detergents, H2O2, or antibiotics, suggesting that the role of
 FtMscS is specific to protection from hypoosmotic shock. The deletion of
 FtMscS also led to a reduced average cell size without altering gross cell
 morphology. The mechanosensitive channel identified and characterized in this
 study likely contributes to the transmission of tularemia between hosts by
 allowing the bacterium to survive the transition from mammalian hosts to
 freshwater.IMPORTANCE The contamination of freshwater by Francisella
 tularensis subsp. holarctica has resulted in a number of outbreaks of
 tularemia. Invariably, the contamination originates from the carcasses or
 excreta of infected animals and thus involves an abrupt osmotic downshock as
 the bacteria enter freshwater. How F. tularensis survives this drastic change
 in osmolarity has not been clear, but here we report that a single
 mechanosensitive channel protects the bacterium from osmotic downshock. This
 channel is functional despite lacking much of the cytoplasmic vestibule
 domain that is present in better-studied organisms such as Escherichia coli;
 this report builds on previous studies that have suggested that parts of this
 domain are dispensable for downshock protection. These findings extend our
 understanding of the aquatic cycle and ecological persistence of F.
 tularensis, with further implications for mechanosensitive channel biology.",
