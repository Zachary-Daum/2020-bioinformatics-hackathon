    abstract "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain cancer
 with an average survival time after diagnosis of only 12-14 months, with few
 (<5%) long-term survivors. A growing body of work suggests that GBMs contain
 a small population of glioma stem cells (GSCs) that are thought to be major
 contributors to treatment resistance and disease relapse. Identifying
 compounds that modulate GSC proliferation would provide highly valuable
 molecular probes of GSC-directed signaling. However, targeting GSCs
 pharmacologically has been challenging. Patient-derived GSCs can be cultured
 as neurospheres, and in vivo these cells functionally recapitulate the
 heterogeneity of the original tumor. Using patient-derived GSC-enriched
 cultures, we have developed a 1536-well spheroid-based proliferation assay
 and completed a pilot screen, testing ~3300 compounds comprising approved
 drugs. This cytotoxic and automation-friendly assay yielded a
 signal-to-background (S/B) ratio of 161.3 +/- 7.5 and Z' of 0.77 +/- 0.02,
 demonstrating its robustness. Importantly, compounds were identified with
 anti-GSC activity, demonstrating the applicability of this assay for
 large-scale high-throughput screening (HTS).",
