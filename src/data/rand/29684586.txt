    abstract "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating, progressive
 neurodegenerative disease with a distinct phenotype characterized by chorea
 and dystonia, incoordination, cognitive decline and behavioral difficulties.
 The precise mechanisms of HD progression are poorly understood; however, it
 is known that there is an expansion of the trinucleotide
 cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat in the Huntingtin gene. Herein
 DI/LC-MS/MS was used to accurately identify and quantify 185 metabolites in
 post mortem frontal lobe and striatum from HD patients and healthy control
 cases. The findings link changes in energy metabolism and phospholipid
 metabolism to HD pathology and also demonstrate significant reductions in
 neurotransmitters. Further investigation into the oxidation of fatty acids
 and phospholipid metabolism in pre-clinical models of HD are clearly
 warranted for the identification of potential therapies. Additionally, panels
 of 5 metabolite biomarkers were identified in both the frontal lobe
 (AUC=0.962 (95% CI: 0.85-1.00) and striatum (AUC=0.988 (95% CI: 0.899-1.00).
 This could have clinical utility in more accessible biomatrices such as blood
 serum for the early detection of those entering the prodromal phase of the
 disease, when treatment is believed to be most effective. Further evaluation
 of these biomarker panels in human cohorts is justified to determine their
 clinical efficacy.",
