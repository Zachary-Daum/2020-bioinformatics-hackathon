    abstract "PURPOSE: Subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been shown
 to be at a higher risk for epilepsy. The vast majority of the previous
 studies have not included a full neuropathological examination. METHODS: The
 objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of epilepsy and
 clinicopathological characteristics in a well-defined study group of 64
 subjects with AD. We evaluated the clinicopathological findings in 64
 subjects (mean age at death 85+/-8.6years) from a longitudi-nal study cohort
 of patients with dementia. RESULTS: Eleven out of the 64 subjects (17%) had a
 history of epilepsy, which is comparable to previous studies. The subjects
 with AD and epilepsy were significantly younger at the time of AD diagnosis
 and at the time of hospitalisation. In addition, their duration of AD was
 longer. Concomitant neuropathology in addition to AD was common in both
 groups and the ApoE genotypes did not differ significantly between the
 groups. CONCLUSION: The strength of this study is a thorough
 neuropathological examination of all study subjects. Our findings support the
 previous literature regarding the prevalence of epilepsy in subjects with AD.
 We have shown that the subjects with AD and epilepsy differ significantly
 from the subjects without epilepsy.",
