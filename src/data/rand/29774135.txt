    abstract "Selective BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib have become a
 treatment option in patients with Langerhans cell Histiocytosis (LCH). To
 date, only 14 patients receiving vemurafenib for LCH have been reported.
 Although vemurafenib can stabilize the clinical condition of these patients,
 it does not seem to cure the patients, and it is unknown, when and how to
 stop vemurafenib treatment. We present a girl with severe multisystem LCH who
 responded only to vemurafenib. After 8 months of treatment, vemurafenib was
 tapered and replaced by prednisone and vinblastine, a strategy which has not
 been described to date. Despite chemotherapy, early relapse occurred, but
 remission was achieved by re-institution of vemurafenib. Further
 investigation needs to address the optimal duration of vemurafenib therapy in
 LCH and whether and which chemotherapeutic regimen may prevent disease
 relapse after cessation of vemurafenib.",
