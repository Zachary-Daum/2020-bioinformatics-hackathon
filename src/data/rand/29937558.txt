    abstract "Background: Alopecia areata (AA) is a common dermatologic
 disease with suspected autoimmune etiology. Tumor necrosis factor superfamily
 member 6 or CD95 (FAS) and FAS ligand (FASL) are proapoptotic proteins. The
 relationship between apoptosis and autoimmunity is well recognized.
 Inflammatory T cells in AA are cytotoxic and possess FAS/FASL antigens. Aim:
 This study aims to investigate the association between FAS-670 A/G and
 FASL-124 A/G gene polymorphisms and AA to clarify if these polymorphisms
 influence disease occurrence or increase disease risk. Materials and Methods:
 A case-control study was conducted on sixty patients with AA, and 40 age- and
 sex-matched healthy subjects, as a control group. Disease severity was
 assessed by severity of alopecia tool (SALT) Score. FAS 670A/G and FASL
 124A/G gene polymorphisms were investigated by the restriction fragment
 length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. Results: For FAS gene, G/G
 genotype was significantly higher in cases than in control group with odds
 ratio 5.1. G allele was more prevalent among patient group with odds ratio
 1.75. For FASL gene, A/G genotype was significantly higher in cases than in
 control group with odds ratio 4.53. G allele was more prevalent among patient
 group with odds ratio 1.88. GG genotype of FAS was significantly associated
 with longer disease duration (P =0.001), recurrent attacks (P =0.01), higher
 SALT score (P =0.009), alopecia universalis (P =0.002), and severe disease (P
 =0.006). Conclusion: FAS and FASL gene polymorphisms are associated with AA.
 Further large-scale studies on different ethnicities are required for more
 clarification of their role in disease development. Therapeutic modalities
 based on their inhibition could be promising in the treatment of a common
 disease like AA.",
