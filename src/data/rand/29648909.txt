    abstract "OBJECTIVE: The use of emergency medical services (EMS) for
 diabetes-related events is believed to be substantial but has not been
 quantified nationally despite the diverse acute complications associated with
 diabetes. We describe diabetes-related EMS activations in 2015 among people
 of all ages from 23 U.S. states. METHODS: We used data from 23 states that
 reported >/=95% of their EMS activations to the U.S. National Emergency
 Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) in 2015. A diabetes-related EMS
 activation was defined using coded EMS provider impressions of ""diabetes
 symptoms"" and coded complaints recorded by dispatch of ""diabetic problem.""
 We described activations by type of location, urbanicity, U.S. Census
 Division, season, and time of day; and patient-events by age category,
 race/ethnicity, disposition, and treatment with glucose. Crude and
 age-adjusted diabetes-related EMS patient-level event rates were calculated
 for adults >/=18 years of age with diagnosed diabetes using the Behavioral
 Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate the population denominator.
 RESULTS: Of 10,324,031 relevant EMS records, 241,495 (2.3%) were
 diabetes-related activations, which involved over 235,000 hours of service.
 Most activations occurred in urban or suburban environ- ments (86.4%), in the
 home setting (73.5%), and were slightly more frequent in the summer months.
 Most patients (72.6%) were >/=45 years of age and over one-half (55.4%) were
 transported to the emergency department. The overall age-adjusted
 diabetes-related EMS event rate was 33.9 per 1,000 persons with diagnosed
 diabetes; rates were highest in patients 18-44 years of age, males, and
 non-Hispanic blacks and varied by U.S. Census Division. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes
 results in a substantial burden on EMS resources. Collection of more detailed
 diabetes complication information in NEMSIS may help facilitate EMS resource
 planning and prevention strategies.",
