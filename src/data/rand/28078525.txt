    abstract "Gold nanoparticles are promising materials for many applications
 that include imaging, drug delivery, and photothermal therapy. However, AuNPs
 can be unstable and/or toxic. We purposed to improve the stability and reduce
 toxicity of gold nanorods (AuNR) upon coating with biocompatible polymer,
 chitosan-ceramide (CS-CE), without replacing the original layer, CTAB.
 CS-CE-coated AuNR was prepared by simple mixing for 24 h and purified by
 centrifugation. The coating was confirmed by UV-Vis absorption analysis and
 surface charge and size measurement. We prepared nanorods with CS or CS-CE
 coating at two different concentrations (5 and 10% AuNR), the resulting in
 larger nanorods with a more positive surface-charge than that of AuNR. We
 investigated the UV-absorption and protein adsorption of the polymer coated
 nanorods. Based on the protein adsorption, AuNR-CS-CE was found to be more
 stable under physiological conditions than AuNR-CS. The cell internalization
 assay revealed that Hela cells internalized higher amounts of AuNR-CS-CE than
 that of AuNR-CS. Cytotoxicity study revealed that AuNR-CS-CE has lower
 toxicity than AuNR against HeLa cells. The CS-CE coating improved the
 stability of AuNR under physiological conditions via the hydrophobic
 interactions between the AuNR lipid surface and the ceramide anchor in the CS
 backbone as well as.",
