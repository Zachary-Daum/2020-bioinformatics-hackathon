    abstract "This study investigated the effect of carbon to nitrogen (C/N)
 ratio of influent wastewater on performance and activated sludge properties
 at a sludge retention time of 5 d in a submerged membrane bioreactor. The
 chemical oxygen demand and ammonia-Nitrogen (NH3-N) removal ef fi ciencies
 were found to be over 96.3% and 86.9% in the sMBRs having different C/N
 ratios. It was found that total extracellular polymeric substances and total
 soluble microbial products increased with an increase in C/N ratio. It was
 also observed that critical flux, relative hydrophobicity and zeta potential
 values decreased, and capillary suction time, particle size and viscosity of
 sludge increased as the C/N ratio increased.",
