    abstract "OBJECTIVES: Published articles reported controversial results
 about the association of breast cancer survival with smoking. Hence, a
 meta-analysis was performed to investigate this association. METHODS: A
 comprehensive search was performed to identify relevant cohort studies (up to
 May 31st, 2016). In the current smoking and former smoking v. never smoking
 analyses, the fixed- or random-effect model was selected based on the
 heterogeneity test among studies. And the heterogeneity was measured using Q
 test and I(2) statistic. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's
 regression asymmetry test. RESULTS: Thirteen articles with 44 studies were
 included. Compared with never smokers, current smokers have a higher breast
 cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality, with pooled hazard ratio
 (HR) (HR = 1.30 95%CI: 1.16-1.45; I(2) = 52.4%) and (HR = 1.59, 95%CI:
 1.41-1.78; I(2) = 87.1%), respectively. While former smokers tend to have a
 moderately increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.10, 95%CI: 1.07-1.12; I(2) =
 0.0%), but there was no significant association between former smoking and
 breast cancer-specific mortality (HR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.90-1.02; I(2) = 0.0%).
 CONCLUSION: The present evidence indicates that current smoking leads to
 higher breast cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality than never
 smoking in breast cancer patients. However former smoking just causes a mild
 increase in all-cause morality, but not breast cancer-specific mortality.",
