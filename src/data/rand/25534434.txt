    abstract "Objective: To examine how ADHD evaluations are documented for
 postsecondary students requesting disability eligibility. Method: A total of
 100 psychological reports submitted for eligibility determination were coded
 for documentation of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
 (DSM) criteria, methods and instruments used in the evaluations, and
 recommended academic accommodations. Results: Results showed that a minimal
 number of reports (</=1%) documented that students met all DSM criteria for
 ADHD. Psychologists rarely documented childhood impairment, symptoms across
 settings, or the use of rule-outs. Symptom severity was emphasized over
 current impairment. The majority of psychologists utilized a multi-informant,
 multi-method evaluation approach, but certain methods (e.g., symptom validity
 tests, record reviews) were limited in use. Most reports included
 recommendations for academic accommodations, with extended time being the
 most common (72%). Conclusion: This study raises awareness to the aspects of
 adequate ADHD evaluation and subsequent documentation that can be improved by
 psychologists. Recommendations are made regarding valid documentation of ADHD
 for disability determination purposes.",
