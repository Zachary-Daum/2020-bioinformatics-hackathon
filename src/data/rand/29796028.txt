    abstract "Cytotoxicity and mitochondrial parameters were studied in
 isolated lymphocytes and their mitochondria obtained from occupationally
 exposed nurses through inhalation exposure to antineoplastic drugs and
 results were compared to those of unexposed nurses. The group of
 occupationally exposed nurses consisted of 50 individuals ranging in age from
 30 to 35 years. The control group included 50 nurses who were not
 occupationally exposed to the preparation and handling of antineoplastic
 drugs and their anthropometric and biochemical characteristics were similar
 to those of the expose group. All cytotoxicity and mitochondrial parameters
 evaluated in exposed group were significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared
 to the unexposed control group. Finally, the results of our study suggest
 that using antioxidant, mitochondrial and lysosomal protective agents can be
 promising drug candidates for the hospital staff in the risk of exposure to
 exposure to antineoplastic drugs.",
