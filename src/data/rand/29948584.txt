    abstract "PURPOSE: Radiation exposure related to conventional
 tachyarrhythmia radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) carries small but
 definite risk for both patients and operators. Today, non-fluoroscopic
 mapping systems enable to perform catheter ablation with minimal or zero
 fluoroscopy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome
 of patients who had undergone ""Zero X-ray"" ablation, since no information
 is available on the very long-term benefits. METHODS: A total of 272
 arrhythmias in 266 patients have been treated with catheter ablation by means
 of a zero-ray approach guided only by a nonconventional mapping system
 (EnSite NavX, Ensite Velocity mapping system; subsequently Ensite Precision
 Abbott, St. Paul, MN). Fluoroscopy was never used. RESULTS: Over a period of
 6 years, patients were followed up for an average of 2.9 +/- 1.6 years. A
 100% rate of acute success was observed in the study population, with a
 complication rate of 0.8%. Chronic success was achieved in 90.8% of the total
 number of procedures (272). Patients in whom the same arrhythmia recurred
 during follow-up underwent to a redo catheter ablation procedure in 60.0% of
 cases, while the remaining 40.0% underwent pharmacological treatment. A new
 post-ablation arrhythmia occurred in 7.7% of the sample. CONCLUSIONS: The
 non-fluoroscopic approach is a feasible and safe alternative to fluoroscopy
 for arrhythmias ablation. This method ensures low complications rates, high
 acute procedural success rates, and comparable long-term outcomes with
 clinical benefits for both patients and physicians. The complete elimination
 of fluoroscopy during catheter ablation is advantageous and does not reduce
 patient safety.",
