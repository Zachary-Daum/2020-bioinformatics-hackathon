    abstract "Stillbirths, or births of infants that died in the womb,
 represent a failure of the materno-feto-placental unit to maintain a suitable
 fetal environment. Typical studies of nonhuman primate (NHP) stillbirth
 patterns are primarily descriptive and focus on macaques (genus Macaca).
 Thus, less is known about other NHP species and rarer still are studies that
 examine possible biological factors that influence stillbirth rates across
 taxa. To examine possible contributors to stillbirths in great apes, we
 analyzed 36 years (1980-2016) of historical data documenting births of
 zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes, N = 391), western lowland gorillas
 (Gorilla gorilla gorilla, N = 491), and orangutans (Pongo spp, N = 307) in
 accredited zoological parks in the United States. The average number of
 births for each of the 446 mothers was 2.7, resulting in a total of 1,189
 births with 143 stillbirths (12%). Stillbirths represented 12% of chimpanzee
 births, 13% of gorilla births, and 10% of orangutan births. We used
 generalized linear mixed-effects models to assess possible relationships
 between stillbirth likelihood and mother origin (wild- versus captive-born),
 age, and genus. Across taxa, older mothers were more likely to have a
 stillbirth (p = 0.004). While these results are likely influenced by both
 biological and management-related factors (e.g., selective captive breeding),
 they may be useful to population managers in evaluating pregnancy risks for
 great apes. Captive settings and archival studbook data such as these may
 provide a unique opportunity to further explore this topic.",
