    abstract "The therapeutic performance of cancer radiotherapy is often
 limited by the overexpression of glutathione (GSH) in tumors and low
 radiation sensitivity of cancerous cells. To address these issues, the
 facilely prepared histidine-capped gold nanoclusters (Au NCs@His) were
 adopted as a radiosensitizer with a high sensitization enhancement ratio of 
 approximately 1.54. On one hand, Au NCs@His can inherit the local radiation
 enhancement property of gold-based materials (external regulation); on the
 other hand, Au NCs@His can decrease the intracellular GSH level, thus
 preventing the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) from being consumed by
 GSH, and arrest the cells at the radiosensitive G2/M phase (internal
 regulation).",
