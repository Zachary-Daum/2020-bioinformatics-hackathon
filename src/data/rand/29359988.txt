    abstract "BACKGROUND: We investigated long-term outcomes for men </=60
 years old treated with proton therapy (PT). METHODS: Of 254 men </=60 years
 old were treated with proton therapy alone for prostate cancer. Risk
 stratification included 56% with low-, 42% with intermediate- and 2% with
 high-risk disease. Patients received 76-82 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction or 70-72.5 Gy
 at 2.5 Gy/fraction. Before treatment and every 6-12 months for 5 years,
 patients were evaluated by a physician, answered health-related quality of
 life surveys, including the EPIC, IIEF and IPSS, and had PSA evaluated.
 RESULTS: Median follow-up for the cohort was 7.1 years; 7-year
 biochemical-free survival was 97.8%. Eight men (one high-risk; five
 intermediate-risk and two low-risk) experienced biochemical progression,
 including one who died of disease 9 years after treatment. Potency (erections
 firm enough for sexual intercourse) was 90% at baseline and declined to 72%
 at the first-year follow-up, but declined to only 67% at 5 years. Only 2% of
 patients developed urinary incontinence requiring pads. The bowel habits mean
 score declined from a baseline of 96 to 88 at 1 year, which improved over the
 following years to 93 at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Young men with prostate cancer
 continue to have excellent results with respect to 7-year biochemical control
 and 5-year erectile function, without clinically significant urinary
 incontinence 5 years after proton therapy. Comparative effectiveness studies
 of proton therapy with surgery and IMRT are needed.",
