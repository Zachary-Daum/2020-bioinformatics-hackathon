    abstract "Genome chaos, or karyotype chaos, represents a powerful survival
 strategy for somatic cells under high levels of stress/selection. Since the
 genome context, not the gene content, encodes the genomic blueprint of the
 cell, stress-induced rapid and massive reorganization of genome topology
 functions as a very important mechanism for genome (karyotype) evolution. In
 recent years, the phenomenon of genome chaos has been confirmed by various
 sequencing efforts, and many different terms have been coined to describe
 different subtypes of the chaotic genome including ""chromothripsis,"" ""chro
moplexy,"" and ""structural mutations."" To advance this exciting field, we
 need an effective experimental system to induce and characterize the
 karyotype reorganization process. In this chapter, an experimental protocol
 to induce chaotic genomes is described, following a brief discussion of the
 mechanism and implication of genome chaos in cancer evolution.",
