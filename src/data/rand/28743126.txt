    abstract "BACKGROUND: beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is the product of concerted
 cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and
 gamma-secretases. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this
 process are not well understood. Recently, evidence was reported that
 gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP, 16 kDa), derived from a larger
 precursor protein (98 kDa), plays a role in Abeta metabolism through a
 mechanism involving its interaction with both gamma-secretase and APP.
 However, a detailed evaluation of GSAP protein levels and their association
 with clinical and neuropathological variables are lacking during the clinical
 progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We quantified levels of the
 GSAP precursor (98 kDa) and its active form (16 kDa) in the frontal cortex
 and hippocampus, areas displaying extensive Abeta and neurofibrillary tangle
 (NFT) pathology, in subjects who came to autopsy with a premortem clinical
 diagnosis of noncognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, mild to
 moderate AD, and severe AD using Western blotting. RESULTS: Analysis found
 that 98-kDa GSAP levels were increased, while those of 16 kDa were reduced in
 the frontal cortex of severe-AD subjects. By contrast, GSAP levels remained
 stable in the hippocampus. Frontal cortex and hippocampal GSAP 98- and 16-kDa
 levels were not associated with Abeta, NFT, and neuropathological criteria
 across clinical groups. Interestingly, only neocortical 98-kDa GSAP values
 showed a significant correlation with the Mini-Mental State Examination and
 episodic memory scores. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that GSAP
 proteins are differentially dysregulated in severe AD, but only the
 full-length form was associated with cognitive test scores in AD.",
