    abstract "BACKGROUND: Less-invasive mitral valve surgery has become a
 widespread procedure in recent years, although mode of perfusion and aortic
 clamping are still debated questions. The aim of this study was to compare
 the results between transthoracic aortic clamping (TTC) and endoaortic
 clamping (EAC) in a multicenter, retrospective study. METHODS: Data from 3
 centers experienced in both TTC and EAC were retrospectively analyzed. Five
 hundred consecutive patients undergoing less-invasive mitral valve surgery
 received either TTC (n = 250) or EAC (n = 250). Age, sex, logistic EuroSCORE,
 ejection fraction, associated procedures, and mitral valve repair rate were
 similar. A higher incidence of previous cardiac operations was observed in
 the EAC group (TTC 8.8% versus EAC 16.8%, p = 0.001). RESULTS: Clamping and
 cardiopulmonary bypass times were comparable between the 2 groups.
 Reoperation for bleeding (TTC 11.2% versus EAC 3.2%, p < 0.001), conversion
 to full sternotomy (6 cases in the TTC group), and hospital length of stay
 (TTC 9 days versus EAC 8 days, p = 0.01) were higher in the TTC group. No
 differences were found in respiratory failure, renal failure, major vascular
 complication, stroke, and in-hospital mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Despite
 recent concerns arising about EAC, this large multicenter study shows
 equivalence in terms of safety and effectiveness of this technique compared
 with TTC. Reduction in postoperative bleeding was observed in the EAC group
 despite the higher rate of complex redo cases.",
