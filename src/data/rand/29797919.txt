    abstract """The opening-closing-pivoting theory"" recorded in Neijing
 (Internal Classic) visualizes the qi activity of six meridians and indicates
 the relationship among the six meridians in physiology and pathology. Through
 the analysis on the classic medical works and modern literature of TCM by the
 modern medical masters, a specific relationship is discovered among the hand
 and foot meridians of the same name and among the zangfu organs. The qi is
 corresponded and interacted among the hand and foot meridians of the same
 name. Except the exterior and interior relationship among the zangfu organs,
 the related communication is also existing. Both meridians and zangfu organs
 are closely related to ""the opening-closing- pivoting"" theory. This
 discovery is the inheritance and development of ""the
 opening-closing-pivoting theory"" and plays the important role in the
 guidance of the acupoint selection of clinical acupuncture analgesia.",
