    abstract "Sepsis is an organic dysfunction that puts at risk the life of
 patients suffering this disorder due to an exacerbated immunological response
 to the infection mediated by the host. Platelets have been largely researched
 on sepsis owing to its role in Disseminated Intracellular Coagulation (DIC)
 and because thrombocytopenia is an important clinical feature of these
 patients. Nevertheless, a great number of evidence shows that platelets have
 also an important role in immunological response since they have pattern
 recognition receptors, chemokine receptors and granules with stored soluble
 mediators. In this work, the immunological features of platelets in
 individuals with sepsis are described. The results show that platelets of
 these individuals have high levels of surfaces expression of TLR4, CD62P,
 CD32 and thrombin receptor 1 (PAR-1), these platelets have also greater
 capability to join Escherichia coli, and show a different profile of soluble
 mediators (IL-1beta, CD40L and TNF-alpha). Platelets from patients with
 sepsis form aggregates with neutrophils in circulation, but are unable to
 induce the production of reactive oxygen species. This research describes
 important features of platelets to help the understanding of the
 immunological role of these cells in sepsis.",
