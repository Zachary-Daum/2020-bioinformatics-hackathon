    abstract "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH) is
 associated with particular clinical features, nonadherence, and suboptimal
 treatment. We assessed possible associations of antihypertensive drug
 classes, specific agents inside each class, and types of combinations, with
 the presence of non-TRH vs. TRH, and with controlled vs. uncontrolled TRH.
 METHODS: Comparisons were done in 14 264 patients treated with three drugs
 (non-TRH: 2988; TRH: 11 276) and in 6974 treated with at least four drugs
 (controlled TRH: 1383; uncontrolled TRH: 5591). Associations were adjusted
 for age, sex, and previous cardiovascular event. RESULTS: In both groups of
 patients treated with three or with at least four drugs, aldosterone
 antagonists among drug classes [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.82 and 1.41,
 respectively], and ramipril (OR: 1.28 and 1.30), olmesartan (OR: 1.31 and
 1.37), and amlodipine (OR: 1.11 and 1.41) inside each class were
 significantly associated with blood pressure control (non-TRH or controlled
 TRH). In patients treated with three drugs, non-TRH was also associated with
 the use of chlorthalidone (OR: 1.50) and bisoprolol (OR: 1.19), whereas in
 patients treated with at least four drugs, controlled TRH was significantly
 associated with the triple combination of a renin-angiotensin system blocker,
 a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic (OR: 1.17). CONCLUSION: The use of
 aldosterone antagonists is associated with blood pressure control in patients
 treated with three or more drugs. Similar results are observed with specific
 agents inside each class, being ramipril, olmesartan, chlorthalidone,
 amlodipine, and bisoprolol those exhibiting significant results. An increased
 use of these drugs might probably reduce the burden of TRH.",
