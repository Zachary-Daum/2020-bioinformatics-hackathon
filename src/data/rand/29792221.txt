    abstract "BACKGROUND: Differences in cardiovascular diseases are evident
 in men and women throughout life and are mainly attributed to the presence of
 sex hormones and chromosomes. Epigenetic mechanisms drive the regulation of
 the biological processes that may lead to CVD and are possibly influenced by
 sex. In order to gain an overview of the status quo on sex differences in
 cardiovascular epigenetics, we performed a systematic review. MATERIALS AND
 METHODS: A systematic search was performed on PubMed and Embase for studies
 mentioning cardiovascular disease, epigenetics, and anything related to sex
 differences. The search returned 3071 publications to be screened. Primary
 included publications focused on cardiovascular and epigenetics research.
 Subsequently, papers were assessed for including both sexes in their studies
 and checked for appropriate sex stratification of results. RESULTS: Two
 independent screeners identified 75 papers in the proper domains that had
 included both sexes. Only 17% (13 papers out of 75) of these publications
 stratified some of their data according to sex. All remaining papers focused
 on DNA methylation solely as an epigenetic mechanism. Of the excluded papers
 that included only one sex, 86% (24 out 28) studied males, while 14% (4 out
 of 28) studied females. CONCLUSION: Our overview indicates that the majority
 of studies into cardiovascular epigenetics do not show their data stratified
 by sex, despite the well-known sex differences in CVD. All included and
 sex-stratified papers focus on DNA methylation, indicating that a lot of
 ground is still to gain regarding other epigenetic mechanisms, like chromatin
 architecture, and histone modifications. More attention to sex in epigenetic
 studies is warranted as such integration will advance our understanding of
 cardiovascular disease mechanisms in men and women.",
