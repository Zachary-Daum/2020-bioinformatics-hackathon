    abstract "PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to investigate two single
 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in PTK2 for associations with human muscle
 strength phenotypes in healthy men. METHODS: Measurement of maximal isometric
 voluntary knee extension (MVCKE) torque, net MVCKE torque and vastus
 lateralis (VL) specific force, using established techniques, was completed on
 120 Caucasian men (age = 20.6 +/- 2.3 year; height = 1.79 +/- 0.06 m; mass =
 75.0 +/- 10.0 kg; mean +/- SD). All participants provided either a blood (n =
 96) or buccal cell sample, from which DNA was isolated and genotyped for the
 PTK2 rs7843014 A/C and rs7460 A/T SNPs using real-time polymerase chain
 reaction. RESULTS: Genotype frequencies for both SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg
 equilibrium (X (2) </= 1.661, P >/= 0.436). VL specific force was 8.3% higher
 in rs7843014 AA homozygotes than C-allele carriers (P = 0.017) and 5.4%
 higher in rs7460 AA homozygotes than T-allele carriers (P = 0.029). No
 associations between either SNP and net MVCKE torque (P >/= 0.094) or peak
 MVCKE torque (P >/= 0.107) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
 identify a genetic contribution to the inter-individual variability within
 muscle specific force and provides the first independent replication, in a
 larger Caucasian cohort, of an association between these PTK2 SNPs and muscle
 specific force, thus extending our understanding of the influence of genetic
 variation on the intrinsic strength of muscle.",
