    abstract "Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) catalyze the phosphorylation and
 conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid. DGK isozymes have
 unique primary structures, expression patterns, subcellular localizations,
 regulatory mechanisms, and DAG preferences. DGKepsilon has a hydrophobic
 segment that promotes its attachment to membranes and shows substrate
 specificity for DAG with an arachidonoyl acyl chain in the sn-2 position of
 the substrate. We determined the role of DGKepsilon in the regulation of
 energy and glucose homeostasis in relation to diet-induced insulin resistance
 and obesity using DGKepsilon-KO and wild-type mice. Lipidomic analysis
 revealed elevated unsaturated and saturated DAG species in skeletal muscle of
 DGKepsilon KO mice, which was paradoxically associated with increased glucose
 tolerance. Although skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity was unaltered,
 whole-body respiratory exchange ratio was reduced, and abundance of
 mitochondrial markers was increased, indicating a greater reliance on fat
 oxidation and intracellular lipid metabolism in DGKepsilon KO mice. Thus, the
 increased intracellular lipids in skeletal muscle from DGKepsilon KO mice may
 undergo rapid turnover because of increased mitochondrial function and lipid
 oxidation, rather than storage, which in turn may preserve insulin
 sensitivity. In conclusion, DGKepsilon plays a role in glucose and energy
 homeostasis by modulating lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle.",
