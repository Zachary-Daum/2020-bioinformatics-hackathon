    abstract "Dementia is any decline in cognition that is significant enough
 to interfere with independent, daily functioning. Dementia is best
 characterized as a syndrome rather than as one particular disease. The causes
 of dementia are myriad and include primary neurologic, neuropsychiatric, and
 medical conditions. It is common for multiple diseases to contribute to any
 one patient's dementia syndrome. Neurodegenerative dementias, like Alzheimer
 disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, are most common in the elderly, while
 traumatic brain injury and brain tumors are common causes in younger adults.
 While the recent decade has seen significant advancements in molecular
 neuroimaging, in understanding clinico-pathologic correlation, and in the
 development of novel biomarkers, clinicians still await disease-modifying
 therapies for neurodegenerative dementias. Until then, clinicians from varied
 disciplines and medical specialties are well poised to alleviate suffering,
 aggressively treat contributing conditions, employ medications to improve
 cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor symptoms, promote evidence-based
 brain-healthy behaviors, and improve overall quality of life for patients and
 families.",
