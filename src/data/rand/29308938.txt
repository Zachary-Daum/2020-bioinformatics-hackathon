    abstract "1. A 2 x 2 factorial experiment was conducted to compare the
 effects of wheat or maize based diets differing in dietary electrolyte
 balance (DEB) on litter moisture and foot pad dermatitis (FPD) at 4, 8 and 12
 weeks of age in heavy-medium turkeys. A second objective was to investigate
 the effects on foot pad dermatitis of the interaction between dietary
 composition and artificially increasing litter moisture by adding water to
 the litter. 2. High DEB diets contained soya as the main protein source
 whereas low DEB diets did not contain soya bean meal. Diets were formulated
 to be iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous in each of 3 successive 4-week phases
 following recommended dietary compositions. DEB concentrations were 330, 290
 and 250 mEq/kg in high DEB diets and 230, 200 and 180 mEq/kg in low DEB
 diets. 3. Litter moisture and mean FPD score were higher in turkeys fed on
 high DEB diets compared with low DEB diets whereas there was no difference
 between maize and wheat. 4. Food intake was similar and body weight was lower
 after litter moisture was artificially raised in the wet compared with the
 dry litter treatment and there was no interaction with dietary composition.
 5. Mean body weight and feed intake were higher in turkeys fed on wheat
 compared with maize and in high DEB compared with low DEB diets at 12 weeks
 of age. 6. Lowering dietary DEB for turkeys may improve litter moisture and
 lower the prevalence of FPD in commercial turkey flocks.",
