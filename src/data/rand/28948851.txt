    abstract "BACKGROUND: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is positioned at the
 crossroads of human migration out of Africa and through to Asia and Europe.
 AIM: To compare the degree of genetic diversity of the Arabian UAE population
 with populations in other countries from the Middle East, South Asia and
 North Africa. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven Y-STR were analysed in 217
 individuals. Y-STR haplotypes from this study were compared to population
 data stored in YHRD, using MDS and AMOVA. RESULTS: Two hundred and twelve
 haplotypes were observed in the 217 individuals studied. Although the
 reduction in Y-STR loci from 27 to 17 resulted in a decrease in
 discriminatory power, comparisons of populations were possible. The UAE
 population clustered closer with other populations of the Middle East. The
 South Asian and North African populations were separated by Middle Eastern
 populations in between both clusters. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to
 report the diversity of a population of the Arabian Peninsula using 27 Y-STR.
 MDS plots show that Middle Eastern populations are positioned in the centre,
 with African, Asian and European populations around the Arab population
 cluster. The findings of this study are consistent with this region being at
 the epicentre of human migration between continents.",
