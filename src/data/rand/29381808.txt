    abstract "Enhanced production of unconventional hydrocarbons in the United
 States has driven interest in natural gas development globally, but
 simultaneously raised concerns regarding water quantity and quality impacts
 associated with hydrocarbon extraction. We conducted a pre-development
 assessment of groundwater geochemistry in the critically water-restricted
 Karoo Basin, South Africa. Twenty-two springs and groundwater samples were
 analyzed for major dissolved ions, trace elements, water stable isotopes,
 strontium and boron isotopes, hydrocarbons and helium composition. The data
 revealed three end-members: a deep, saline groundwater with a sodium-chloride
 composition, an old, deep freshwater with a sodium-bicarbonate-chloride
 composition and a shallow, calcium-bicarbonate freshwater. In a few cases, we
 identified direct mixing of the deep saline water and shallow groundwater.
 Stable water isotopes indicate that the shallow groundwater was controlled by
 evaporation in arid conditions, while the saline waters were diluted by
 apparently fossil meteoric water originated under wetter climatic conditions.
 These geochemical and isotopic data, in combination with elevated helium
 levels, suggest that exogenous fluids are the source of the saline
 groundwater and originated from remnant seawater prior to dilution by old
 meteoric water combined with further modification by water-rock interactions.
 Samples with elevated methane concentrations (>14 ccSTP/kg) were strongly
 associated with the sodium-chloride water located near dolerite intrusions,
 which likely provide a preferential pathway for vertical migration of deeply
 sourced hydrocarbon-rich saline waters to the surface. This pre-drill
 evaluation indicates that the natural migration of methane- and salt-rich
 waters provides a source of geogenic contamination to shallow aquifers prior
 to shale gas development in the Karoo Basin.",
