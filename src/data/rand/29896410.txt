    abstract "The population undergoing dialysis is aging worldwide,
 particularly in Japan. The clinical condition of frailty is the most
 problematic expression in the elderly population. Potential
 pathophysiological factors of frailty present in patients with CKD and are
 accentuated in patients with ESRD. The aim of this study was to identify the
 prevalence and predictors of frailty in Japanese HD patients. This study was
 a multicenter, cross-sectional and observational investigation conducted at 6
 institutions. To evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype
 adjusted for Japanese as the self-reported questionnaire was used. Of the 542
 patients visiting each institution, 388 were enrolled in this study. In
 total, 26.0% of participants were categorized as not-frailty, 52.6% as
 pre-frailty and 21.4% as frailty. The prevalence of frailty increased
 steadily with age and was more prevalent in females than in males and the
 subjects with frailty received polypharmacy. A multivariate logistic
 regression analysis revealed that the factors independently associated with
 frailty were the following: female gender (odds ratio [OR] = 3.661, 95%
 confidence interval [CI] 1.398-9.588), age (OR = 1.065, 95% CI 1.014-1.119),
 age >/= 75 years old (OR = 4.892, 95% CI 1.715-13.955), body mass index (BMI)
 < 18.5 (OR = 0.110, 95% CI 0.0293-0.416), number of medications being taken
 (OR = 1.351, 95% CI 1.163-1.570), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR = 2.765, 95% CI
 1.081-7.071) and MNA-SF </= 11 (OR = 7.405, 95% CI 2.732-20.072). Frailty was
 associated with the accumulation of risk factors. The prevalence of frailty
 in Japanese patients with HD was relatively lower than that previously
 reported in Western developed countries; however, it was extremely high
 compared to the general population regardless of age. Our findings suggest
 that frailty might be associated with an increase in the prevalence of
 adverse health outcomes in patients with HD.",
