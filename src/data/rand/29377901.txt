    abstract "BACKGROUND: Limited data are available regarding optimal
 selection criteria for pancreas transplant alone (PTA) to minimize
 aggravation of diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: A total of 87 type 1 diabetic
 patients were evaluated before and after PTA at a single center from January,
 1999 to December, 2015, together with 87 matched non-transplanted type 1
 diabetic subjects who were candidates for PTA to compare deterioration of
 native kidney function. A total of 163 patients (79 in the transplanted group
 and 84 in the nontransplanted group) were finally enrolled after excluding
 nine patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60
 mL/min/1.73 m2 and two patients with moderate proteinuria (>/= 1.5 g/day).
 RESULTS: A total of seven recipients (8.9%) had end-stage renal disease
 post-transplant whereas only one patient (1.2%) developed end-stage renal
 disease in the nontransplanted group during their follow-up period (median
 12.0, range 6-96 months) (p = 0.03). Furthermore, a composite of severe renal
 dysfunction and end-stage renal disease (31.6% vs 2.4%) was significantly
 higher in the transplanted group (p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression
 analysis revealed that a higher level of tacrolimus at six months
 post-transplant (HR = 1.648, CI = 1.140-2.385, p = 0.008) was the only
 significant factor associated with end-stage renal disease. CONCLUSIONS:
 There is a considerable risk for deterioration of renal function in PTA
 recipients post-transplant compared with non-transplant diabetic patients.
 With rather strict selection criteria such as preoperative proteinuria and
 estimated glomerular filtration rate, PTA should be considered in diabetic
 patients to minimize post-transplant aggravation of diabetic nephropathy.",
