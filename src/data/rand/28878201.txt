    abstract "Recent advances in high-throughput laboratory techniques
 captured large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, making it
 possible to create a detailed map of protein interaction networks, and thus
 enable us to detect protein complexes from these PPI networks. However, most
 of the current state-of-the-art studies still have some problems, for
 instance, incapability of identifying overlapping clusters, without
 considering the inherent organization within protein complexes, and
 overlooking the biological meaning of complexes. Therefore, we present a
 novel overlapping protein complexes prediction method based on
 core-attachment structure and function annotations (CFOCM), which performs in
 two stages: first, it detects protein complex cores with the maximum value of
 our defined cluster closeness function, in which the proteins are also
 closely related to at least one common function. Then it appends attach
 proteins into these detected cores to form the returned complexes. For
 performance evaluation, CFOCM and six classical methods have been used to
 identify protein complexes on three different yeast PPI networks, and three
 sets of real complexes including the Munich Information Center for Protein
 Sequences (MIPS), the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) and the Catalogues
 of Yeast protein Complexes (CYC2008) are selected as benchmark sets, and the
 results show that CFOCM is indeed effective and robust for achieving the
 highest F-measure values in all tests.",
