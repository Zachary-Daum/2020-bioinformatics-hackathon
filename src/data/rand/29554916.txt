    abstract "BACKGROUND: Public health research often focuses on gender
 differences within certain diagnoses, but so far research has failed to
 explain these differences in a satisfactory way. Theoretical development
 could be one prerequisite for moving beyond categorical thinking. The aim of
 this paper was to analyse how gender theories have been used in public health
 research in relation to various methodological approaches. METHOD: Six
 special issues of gender research with public health relevance (comprising 33
 papers in total) were identified from a search of PubMed and Web of Science,
 spanning a 10-year period. The papers were analysed inductively through
 posing questions to the text. RESULTS: Gender theories were used in eight
 different ways: 1. to test hypotheses, 2. integrate theories, 3. develop
 gender concepts and models, 4. interpret findings, 5. understand health
 problems, 6. illustrate the validity of other theories, 7. integrated into a
 gender blind theory, as well as to 8. critique of other gender theories. The
 strategies applied seemed independent of the health aspects of the papers.
 However, the methodologies were of importance, indicating that both
 theoretical papers and papers using qualitative methodologies used almost all
 available strategies, while papers using quantitative empirical research used
 a limited number of strategies. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to
 identifying how gender theories are used in contemporary public health
 research, which can help researchers move beyond a categorical understanding
 of gender in health research.",
