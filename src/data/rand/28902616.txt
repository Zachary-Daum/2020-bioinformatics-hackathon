    abstract "BACKGROUND: The MADS-box transcription factor myocyte enhancer
 factor 2C (MEF2C) is required for the cardiac development and postnatal
 adaptation and in mice-targeted disruption of the MEF2C gene results in
 dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, in humans, the association of MEF2C
 variation with DCM remains to be investigated. METHODS: The coding regions
 and splicing boundaries of the MEF2C gene were sequenced in 172 unrelated
 patients with idiopathic DCM. The available close relatives of the index
 patient harboring an identified MEF2C mutation and 300 unrelated, ethnically
 matched healthy individuals used as controls were genotyped for MEF2C. The
 functional effect of the mutant MEF2C protein was characterized in contrast
 to its wild-type counterpart by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay
 system. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous MEF2C mutation, p.Y157X, was detected
 in an index patient with adult-onset DCM. Genetic screen of the mutation
 carrier's family members revealed that the mutation co-segregated with DCM,
 which was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete
 penetrance. The non-sense mutation was absent in 300 control individuals.
 Functional analyses unveiled that the mutant MEF2C protein had no
 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the mutation abolished the synergistic
 transactivation between MEF2C and GATA4 as well as HAND1, two other
 transcription factors that have been associated with DCM. CONCLUSIONS: This
 study indicates MEF2C as a new gene responsible for human DCM, which provides
 novel insight into the mechanism underpinning DCM, suggesting potential
 implications for development of innovative prophylactic and therapeutic
 strategies for DCM, the most prevalent form of primary myocardial disease.",
