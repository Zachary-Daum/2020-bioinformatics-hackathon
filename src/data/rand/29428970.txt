    abstract "The taxonomic position of a novel Amycolatopsis strain isolated
 from a high altitude Atacama Desert subsurface soil was established using a
 polyphasic approach. The strain, isolate H5(T), was shown to have chemical
 properties typical of members of the genus Amycolatopsis such as
 meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan,
 arabinose and galactose as diagnostic sugars and MK-9(H4) as the predominant
 isoprenologue. It also has cultural and morphological properties consistent
 with its classification in the genus, notably the formation of branching
 substrate hyphae which fragment into rod-like elements. 16S rRNA gene
 sequence analyses showed that the strain is closely related to the type
 strain of Amycolatopsis mediterranei but could be distinguished from this and
 other related Amycolatopsis strains using a broad range of phenotypic
 properties. It was separated readily from the type strain of Amycolatopsis
 balhymycina, its near phylogenetic neighbour, based on multi-locus sequence
 data, by low average nucleotide identity (92.9%) and in silico DNA/DNA
 relatedness values (51.3%) calculated from draft genome assemblies.
 Consequently, the strain is considered to represent a novel species of
 Amycolatopsis for which the name Amycolatopsis vastitatis sp. nov. is
 proposed. The type strain is H5(T) (= NCIMB 14970(T) = NRRL B-65279(T)).",
