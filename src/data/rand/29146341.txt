    abstract "The chemical changes (oxidation/nitrosation) of meat proteins
 during digestion lead to a decrease in their nutritional value. Moreover,
 oxidized and nitrosated amino acids are suspected to promote various human
 pathologies. To investigate the mechanisms and the kinetics of these
 endogenous protein modifications, we used a dynamic artificial digestive
 system (DIDGI(R)) that mimics the physicochemical conditions of digestion.
 The combined effect of meat cooking and endogenous addition of ascorbate and
 nitrite was evaluated on protein oxidation (by measuring carbonyl groups),
 protein nitrosation (by measuring nitrosamines), and proteolysis.
 Considerable carbonylation was observed in the digestive tract, especially
 under the acidic conditions of the stomach. Nitrosamines, caused by ammonia
 oxidation, were formed in conditions in which no nitrite was added, although
 the addition of nitrite in the model significantly increased their levels.
 Meat cooking and nitrite addition significantly decreased protein digestion.
 The interactions between all the changes affecting the proteins are discussed.",
