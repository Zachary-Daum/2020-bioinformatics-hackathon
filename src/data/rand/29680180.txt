    abstract "BACKGROUND: The use of nomograms for predicting clinical
 endpoints has been well documented. Nomograms provide an individualized
 prognosis and help clinicians determine the effectiveness of treatment for a
 given patient. Early identification of potential treatment failure or
 toxicity allows alternative approaches to be considered, reducing unnecessary
 treatment, morbidity, and cost. This review aims to evaluate clinical
 potential of nomogram use for the management of prostate cancer radiotherapy
 patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched for literature
 published between 2006 and 2016. The reported correlation between measured
 and nomogram-predicted probabilities of biochemical control, disease
 progression, survival and toxicity was reviewed, through an analysis of
 concordance indexes and areas under the curves. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were
 reviewed. Outcomes predicted by the nomogram were very close to outcomes
 measured (concordance index of 0.7 and above) in the majority. But a
 combination of under and overestimation of outcome was also reported. The
 predictive accuracy of nomograms was very variable, however, most nomograms
 had accuracy greater than chance, indicated by a concordance index higher
 than 0.5. CONCLUSION: Nomograms can be used as prognostic guides to aid
 clinical decision-making for prostate cancer patients until further research
 addresses the limitations presented in this review. Strict definitions of end
 points should be added to future models and perhaps models could be enhanced
 with the incorporation of genomic variables or tumor specific parameters.",
