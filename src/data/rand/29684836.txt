    abstract "In the current healthcare environment, ambulatory care nursing
 is increasingly recognized as an efficient and effective way of collaborating
 with clients to improve health outcomes and to focus on prevention. Nursing
 skills in ambulatory care are both valuable and necessary. However, few
 undergraduate nursing programs provide content on ambulatory care or
 significant clinical experience outside the context of an acute care setting.
 To meet this gap in education, a baccalaureate undergraduate course in
 ambulatory care nursing was created to address the growing need for RNs in
 this field. In collaboration with affiliated healthcare systems, this course
 provides the knowledge and skills needed to enable new RNs to enter this
 challenging and rapidly changing specialty.",
