    abstract "The transition from onchocerciasis control to elimination
 requires country programmes to rethink their approach to a variety of
 activities as they move from addressing morbidity to addressing transmission
 of the parasite. Although the 2016 WHO guidelines provide extensive
 recommendations, it was beyond the scope of the document to provide guidance
 on all aspects of the transition. This paper will discuss some of the
 important issues that programmes are grappling with as they transition to
 elimination and provide some potential approaches that programmes can use to
 address them. Although there are some data to support some aspects of the
 suggested approaches, operational research will be needed to generate data to
 support these approaches further and to determine how programmes could best
 tailor them to their own unique epidemiological challenges. Good
 communication between the national programmes and the broader global
 programme will facilitate the clear articulation of programmatic challenges
 and the development of the evidence to support programme decision-making.",
