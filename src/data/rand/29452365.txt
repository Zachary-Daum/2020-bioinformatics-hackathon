    abstract "This study contributes to the health policy debate on medical
 systems integration by describing and analysing the interactions between
 health-care users, indigenous healers, and the biomedical public health
 system, in the so far rarely documented case of post-conflict Burundi. We
 adopt a mixed-methods approach combining (1) data from an existing survey on
 access to health-care, with 6,690 individuals, and (2) original interviews
 and focus groups conducted in 2014 with 121 respondents, including indigenous
 healers, biomedical staff, and health-care users. The findings reveal
 pluralistic patterns of health-care seeking behaviour, which are not
 primarily based on economic convenience or level of education. Indigenous
 healers' diagnosis is shown to revolve around the concept of 'enemy' and the
 need for protection against it. We suggest ways in which this category may
 intersect with the widespread experience of trauma following the civil
 conflict. Finally, we find that, while biomedical staff displays ambivalent
 attitudes towards healers, cross-referrals occasionally take place between
 healers and health centres. These findings are interpreted in light of the
 debate on health systems integration in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, we
 discuss policy options regarding healers' accreditation, technical training,
 management of cross-referrals as well as of herb-drug interactions; and we
 emphasise healers' psychological support role in helping communities deal
 with trauma. In this respect, we argue that the experience of conflict, and
 the experiences and conceptualizations of mental and physical illness, need
 to be taken into account when devising appropriate public or international
 health policy responses.",
