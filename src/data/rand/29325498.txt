    abstract "The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) is a popular measure
 of psychological distress. Despite its widespread use, an ongoing controversy
 pertains to its internal structure. Although the GHQ-12 was originally
 constructed to capture a unitary construct, empirical studies identified
 different factor structures. Therefore, this study examined the
 dimensionality of the GHQ-12 in two independent meta-analyses. The first
 meta-analysis used summary data published in 38 primary studies (total N =
 76,473). Meta-analytic exploratory factor analyses identified two factors
 formed by negatively and positively worded items. The second meta-analysis
 included individual responses of 410,640 participants from 84 independent
 samples. Meta-analytic confirmatory factor analyses corroborated the
 two-dimensional structure of the GHQ-12. However, bifactor modelling showed
 that most of the variance was explained by a general factor. Therefore,
 subscale scores reflected rather limited unique variance. Overall, the two
 meta-analyses demonstrated that the GHQ-12 is essentially unidimensional. It
 is not recommended to use and interpret subscale scores because they
 primarily reflect general mental health rather than distinct constructs.",
