    abstract "Our society's current energy demands are largely met by the
 exploitation of fossil fuels, which are unsustainable and environmentally
 harmful resources. However, Nature has provided us with a clean and virtually
 limitless alternative in the form of solar energy. This abundant resource is
 utilized constantly by photosynthetic organisms, which has in turn motivated
 decades of research in our quest to create artificial counterparts of
 comparable scales. In this feature article, we will highlight some of the
 recent novel approaches in the field of artificial photosynthesis (AP), which
 we define by a more general term as a process that stores energy overall by
 generating fuels and chemicals using light. We will particularly emphasize on
 the potential of a highly modular plug-and-play concept that we hope will
 persuade the community to explore a more inclusive variety of multielectron
 redox catalysis to complement the proton reduction and water oxidation
 half-reactions in traditional solar water splitting systems. We discuss some
 of the latest developments in the vital functions of light harvesting, charge
 separation, and multielectron reductive and oxidative catalysis, as well as
 their optimization, to achieve the ultimate goal of storing sunlight in
 chemical bonds. Specific attention is dedicated to the use of earth-abundant
 elements and molecular catalysts that offer greater product selectivity and
 more intricate control over the reactivity than heterogeneous systems. In
 this context, we showcase our team's contributions in presenting a unique
 oxidative carbon-carbon bond cleavage reaction in aliphatic alcohols and
 biomass model compounds, under ambient atmospheric conditions, facilitated by
 vanadium photocatalysts. We offer this discovery as a promising alternative
 to water oxidation in an integrated AP system, which would concurrently
 generate both solar fuels and valuable solar chemicals.",
