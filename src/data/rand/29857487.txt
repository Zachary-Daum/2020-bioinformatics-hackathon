    abstract "An amorphous polyethylene/silica (PE/S) interface exists in many
 materials. However, the research of the interfacial properties at microscale
 is lacking. Shear failure and adhesion properties of an amorphous PE/S
 interface are studied by molecular dynamics. The effects of PE chain length,
 the number of chains, and coupling agents on the shear behavior and
 interfacial adhesion are investigated. It is found that the modified silica
 (mS) surface induces an increase in the adhesion strength compared to
 unmodified S. The damage process and failure mode of the PE/S and PE/mS
 interface are analyzed at microscale. The contribution of bond length, bond
 angle, torsional potentials, and nonbonded energy is estimated as a function
 of the shear deformation to clarify the deformation mechanisms. The energy
 partitioning results indicate that the elastic, yield, and postyielding
 regions are mostly controlled by the nonbonded interactions. The dihedral
 motions of the chains also have an influence. Furthermore, the simulation
 results exhibit how the internal mechanism evolves with the shear deformation.",
