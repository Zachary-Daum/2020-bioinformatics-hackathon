    abstract "BACKGROUND: Scleroderma is caused by aberrant transforming
 growth factor-ss signaling. The degradation of extracellular matrix proteins
 is regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of
 metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation has been a therapy for
 scleroderma. 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), an endogenous aryl
 hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligand, is a tryptophan metabolite generated by UV
 exposure. Nonetheless, whether FICZ regulates MMPs and TIMPs has not been
 investigated. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the regulatory roles of FICZ in the
 expression of MMPs and TIMPs in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs).
 METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to
 determine the expression of MMPs or TIMPs in the NHDFs treated with FICZ or
 UVB. The MMPs levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The
 actions of FICZ on MMPs were analyzed using AHR-knockdown NHDFs or selective
 inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).
 Microtubule-associated protein kinase (MEK) and extracellular
 signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation was examined by western
 blotting. RESULTS: UVB increased the mRNA and protein levels of MMP1 and MMP3
 in NHDFs, while FICZ upregulated those of MMP1, but not MMP3. The effects of
 FICZ on TIMPs were negligible. FICZ increased MMP1 expression in an
 AHR-dependent manner. The FICZ-induced MMP1 upregulation was ameliorated with
 MEK/ERK inhibitors, whereas the effects of UVB were canceled with c-Jun
 N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-MAPK as well as MEK/ERK inhibitors.
 FICZ-induced ERK phosphorylation is dependent on AHR. CONCLUSION: FICZ
 contributes to the UV-mediated anti-fibrotic effects via the AHR/MEK/ERK
 signal pathway in NHDFs. FICZ is a potential therapeutic agent for
 scleroderma.",
