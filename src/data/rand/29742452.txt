    abstract "The desire of eternal youth seems to be as old as mankind.
 However, the increasing life expectancy experienced by populations in
 developed countries also involves a significantly increased incidence of the
 most common age-related diseases (ARDs). Senescent cells (SCs) have been
 identified as culprits of organismal aging. Their number rises with age and
 their senescence-associated secretory phenotype fuels the chronic,
 pro-inflammatory systemic state (inflammaging) that characterizes aging,
 impairing the regenerative ability of stem cells and increasing the risk of
 developing ARDs. A variegated class of molecules, including synthetic
 senolytic compounds and natural compounds contained in food, have been
 suggested to possess anti-senescence activity. Senolytics are attracting
 growing interest, and their safety and reliability as anti-senescence drugs
 are being assessed in human clinical trials. Notably, since SCs spread
 inflammation at the systemic level through pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory
 signals, foods rich in polyphenols, which exert antioxidant and
 anti-inflammatory actions, have the potential to be harnessed as ""anti-senes
cence foods"" in a nutraceutical approach to healthier aging. We discuss the
 beneficial effects of polyphenol-rich foods in relation to the Mediterranean
 diet and the dietary habits of long-lived individuals, and examine their
 ability to modulate bacterial genera in the gut.",
