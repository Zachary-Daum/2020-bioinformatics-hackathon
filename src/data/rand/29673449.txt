    abstract "This study investigated the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
 and ascorbic acid (AA) on hemin-induced K562 cell erythroid differentiation
 and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this process. Hemin
 increased ROS levels in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas NAC and AA
 had opposite effects. Both NAC and AA eliminated transient increased ROS
 levels after hemin treatment, inhibited hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis,
 and decreased mRNA expression levels of beta-globin, gamma-globin, and GATA-1
 genes significantly. Pretreatment with 5,000 mumol/L AA for 2 h resulted in a
 considerably lower inhibition ratio of hemoglobin synthesis than that when
 pretreated for 24 h, whereas the ROS levels were the lowest when treated with
 5,000 mumol/L AA for 2 h. These results show that NAC and AA might inhibit
 hemin-induced K562 cell erythroid differentiation by downregulating ROS
 levels.",
