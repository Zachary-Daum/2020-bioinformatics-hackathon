    abstract "India's National Health Insurance Scheme, Rashtriya Swasthya
 Bima Yojana (RSBY), expands health services to families living below the
 poverty line by enrolling them into the scheme through selected health
 facilities. Use and reasons for nonuse of RSBY for family planning (FP) and
 reproductive health (RH) services have not been explored previously. This
 cross-sectional study explored the use of RSBY for FP/RH services at private
 health facilities, knowledge of FP/RH service availability, and factors
 influencing knowledge among RSBY enrolled families. A total of 726 women and
 640 men from enrolled families living in 3 cities of Uttar Pradesh, India,
 were interviewed. Use of FP/RH services at private hospitals enrolled in the
 RSBY was 2%. Nearly 20% of respondents used FP or delivery services from
 unenrolled private hospitals but could have accessed these services through
 the scheme. Over 75% of respondents were unaware of FP/RH service
 availability through RSBY. Respondents with some education were more likely
 to have this knowledge, while poorer families were less likely to have this
 knowledge. Findings suggest that for RSBY to reach the most vulnerable
 families, efforts need to be made to better educate enrolled families about
 their entitlements and benefits of the scheme.",
