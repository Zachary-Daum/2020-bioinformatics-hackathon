    abstract "INTRODUCTION: The S2 alar-iliac (S2AI) screw is a modification
 of the traditional iliac fixation technique and has surgical and
 biomechanical benefits. However, there are significant regional neurovascular
 structures along the path of such screws. Therefore the current anatomic
 study was performed to better elucidate these relationships. METHODS: Using
 fluoroscopy, S2AI screws were placed in 2 adult cadavers through a standard
 posterior midline exposure. The screw insertion point was placed 10 mm
 lateral to a line bisecting the S1 and S2 foramina, adjacent to the
 sacroiliac joint. Using 30- to 40-degree lateral angulation from the midline
 and 20- to 30-degree caudal angulation, a pedicle probe was directed toward
 the anterior inferior iliac spine. The final trajectory was positioned to sit
 1-2 cm superior to the greater sciatic foramen. Lastly, the screws and
 surrounding bone were drilled in order to visualize both lateral and medial
 neurovascular relationships. RESULTS: Removing the bone around the S2AI-screw
 illustrated the close relationship to the medial (internal) neurovascular
 structures including the obturator nerve, lumbosacral trunk, sacral plexus
 and, specifically, the S1 ventral ramus and iliac vein and artery. By
 removing the outer cortex of the ilium, the close relationship to the
 superior gluteal artery, vein, and nerve was observed. In addition, we were
 able to identify the proximity to the iliopsoas muscle and internal iliac
 vessels. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive knowledge of the surrounding
 neurovascular anatomy relevant to S2AI screw placement can decrease patient
 morbidity and allow spine surgeons to better diagnose potential postoperative
 complications.",
