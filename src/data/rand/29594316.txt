    abstract "Although the therapeutics have improved the rates of remission
 and cure of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in recent decades, there is
 still an unmet medical need for AML therapies because disease relapses are a
 major obstacle in patients who become refractory to salvage therapy. The
 development of therapeutic agents promoting both cytotoxicity and cell
 differentiation may provide opportunities to improve the clinical outcome.
 Dioscin-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells was identified through death
 receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The formation of Bak and tBid,
 and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were induced by dioscin
 suggesting the activation of intrinsic apoptotsis pathway. A functional
 analysis of transcription factors using transcription factor-DNA interaction
 array and IPA analysis demonstrated that dioscin induced a profound increase
 of protein expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), a
 critical factor for myeloid differentiation. Two-dimensional gel
 electrophoresis assay confirmed the increase of C/EBPalpha expression.
 Dioscin-induced differentiation was substantiated by an increase of CD11b
 protein expression and the induction of differentiation toward
 myelomonocytic/granulocytic lineages using hematoxylin and eosin staining.
 Moreover, both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways after two-dimensional
 gel electrophoresis assay and IPA network enrichment analysis were proposed
 to dioscin action. In conclusion, the data suggest that dioscin exerts its
 antileukemic effect through the upregulation of both death ligands and death
 receptors and a crosstalk activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway with
 the collaboration of tBid and Bak formation. In addition, proteomics approach
 reveals an altered metabolic signature of dioscin-treated cells and the
 induction of differentiation of promyelocytes to granulocytes and monocytes
 in which the C/EBPalpha plays a key role.",
