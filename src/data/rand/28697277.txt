    abstract "In the wake of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami,
 the Ministry of Environment in Japan asked municipalities nationwide to
 accept and treat disaster waste. This call for cross-jurisdictional waste
 treatment provoked considerable public controversy. To explore how the
 national and municipal governments can seek more public acceptance in the
 wake of future disasters, this study implemented a nationwide survey and
 addressed the question of what factors influence the public's willingness to
 support their municipalities' plans to host disaster waste. Three strands of
 the literature-on risk perception, public dissent, and prosocial
 behavior-offer valuable insights into hypothesis building, although none has
 addressed the above question. Estimates from an ordered logistic regression
 (N = 1,063) reveal that the conditions of a nuclear accident and living with
 a small child in the household would lower the level of support for accepting
 disaster waste, although this does not mean that people would give their
 support in the absence of a nuclear accident. The results also suggest that
 the national and municipal governments should communicate more with the
 public about the risks, benefits, and costs associated with hosting disaster
 debris, and make efforts to improve public trust in the national government.",
