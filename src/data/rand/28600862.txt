    abstract "  This paper presents the biophysical impact of various
 interventions made under watershed development programs, in terms of the
 creation of additional water resources, and resultant changes in land use and
 cropping patterns in the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh State, India.
 Both primary and secondary data gathered from randomly selected watersheds
 and their corresponding control villages were used in this study. Analysis
 revealed that emphasis was given primarily to the creation of water resources
 potential during implementation of the programs, which led to augmentation of
 surface and groundwater availability for both irrigation and non-agricultural
 purposes. In addition, other land based interventions for soil and moisture
 conservation, plantation activities, and so forth, were taken up on both
 arable and nonarable land, which helped to improve land slope and land use,
 cropping pattern, agricultural productivity, and vegetation cover.",
