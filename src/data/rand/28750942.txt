    abstract "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hovenia dulcis, known as the
 oriental raisin tree, is mainly found in East Asia. It has long been used as
 traditional folk remedies for alcohol intoxication. AIM OF THE STUDY: To
 examine the anti-hangover effect of Hovenia dulcis Thunb. fruit extract (HDE)
 in a randomized controlled crossover trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six
 eligible male adults with heterozygous ALDH2 (23.7+/-0.3 years old) consumed
 360mL of Korean Soju (50g alcohol) together with HDE (2460mg) or matched
 placebo with subsequent crossover. The blood samples were taken at baseline
 and 1, 4, and 12h post-treatment. RESULTS: Blood alcohol, acetaldehyde, and
 total hangover scores were highest at 1h post-treatment with no difference
 between groups, but declines in hangover symptom scores were significant in
 the HDE group compared to the placebo group. Significant differences between
 groups were also observed on interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-10/IL-6 ratio, and
 aspartate aminotransferase levels, but not on endotoxins. Pearson correlation
 analysis revealed a positive correlation between total hangover symptom
 scores and IL-6 and IL-10 level. Further analyses by CYP2E1 polymorphism at
 rs10776687, rs2031920, rs3813867, and rs4838767 alleles showed a reversed
 association, suggesting that CYP2E1 polymorphism might be an effect modifier.
 CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a favorable effect of HDE on alcohol
 hangovers might be associated with enhancing homeostatic regulation of
 inflammatory response. The magnitude of impact might be different in the
 presence of CYP2E1 polymorphism.",
