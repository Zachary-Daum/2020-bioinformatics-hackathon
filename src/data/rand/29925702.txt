    abstract "The aims of this study were to describe health insurance reforms
 initiated by the Chinese government over the past two decades, to review
 their achievements in reducing the medical economic burden, and to summarize
 the challenges that still exist regarding a further reduction in
 out-of-pocket expenditures in this country. China has successfully attained
 the goal of providing health insurance coverage to almost the entire
 population by developing a mixed health insurance system, which consists of
 Urban Employees Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), Urban Resident Basic Medical
 Insurance (URBMI), New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), and
 supplementary Catastrophic Health Insurance. Despite this achievement, China
 is still facing the challenges of a disparity in the medical economic burden
 by region and by health insurance scheme, relatively little protection from
 financial risk compared to developed countries, as well as low efficiency and
 quality of care under current payment systems. To further reduce the
 disparity in the medical economic burden and to increase the overall
 protection from financial risk in China, the Government should increase
 central government transfers to NCMS and URBMI enrollees in poor regions and
 increase the total amount of government subsidies to NCMS. In addition, China
 should improve the efficiency and quality of health insurance by further
 reforming the payment system.",
