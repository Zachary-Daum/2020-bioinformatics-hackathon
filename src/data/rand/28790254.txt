    abstract "Healthcare workers who occupationally handle hazardous
 drugs(HD)have been reported to be at high risk of reproductive toxicity and
 carcinogenicity by long-term exposure even in trace amounts. The risk is
 determined not only by the toxicity of the drug but also by how much HD is
 absorbed in the body. Adverse events due to exposure to anticancer drugs can
 be classified into biological effects expressed at the cell and gene level,
 and effects on health expressed on individual level, the latter appearing as
 acute symptoms in the short term. In the long term, the effects on
 reproduction and development of malignant tumors become a problem.",
