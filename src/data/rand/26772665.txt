    abstract "Sexual assault is a major concern on the U.S. college campus.
 Engaging students as pro-social bystanders has become more common as a
 potentially effective mechanism for reducing the incidence of sexual assault
 and mitigating the harm of assaults that have already occurred. Understanding
 the influences of pro-social bystander behavior is imperative to developing
 effective programs, and the use of an evidence-based theoretical framework
 can help identify the differences between students who intervene and those
 who do not when presented with the opportunity. A sample of 815 undergraduate
 university students completed the Sexual Assault Bystander Behavior
 Questionnaire, a survey based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) that
 investigates students' perceived behavioral control to intervene, subjective
 norms that support intervening, attitudes toward intervening, and intent to
 intervene in the future. Two-tailed t tests revealed interveners reported
 significantly greater perceived behavioral control than non-interveners for
 eight of the 12 intervention behaviors, more supportive subjective norms than
 non-interveners for seven of the 12 intervention behaviors, more positive
 attitudes than non-interveners for only one of the 12 intervention behaviors,
 and greater intent to intervene in the future for six of the 12 intervention
 behaviors. Differences in the four TPB variables were not consistent for the
 12 intervention behaviors. The use of a theoretical framework found to be
 effective in explaining-and changing-other health-related behaviors, and the
 inquiry into students' opportunities to intervene to compare against their
 reported intervention behaviors, is new to this body of literature and
 contributes to the understanding of the influences of pro-social bystander
 behavior.",
