    abstract "The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera:
 Liviidae), is an important insect pest of citrus. It is the vector of 
'Candidatus' Liberibacter asiaticus, a phloem-limited bacterium that infects
 citrus, resulting in the disease Huanglongbing (HLB). Disease management
 relies heavily on suppression of D. citri populations with insecticides,
 including pyrethroids. In recent annual surveys to monitor insecticide
 resistance, reduced susceptibility to fenpropathrin was identified in several
 field populations of D. citri. The primary target of pyrethroids is the
 voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC). The VGSC is prone to target-site
 insensitivity because of mutations that either reduce pyrethroid binding
 and/or alter gating kinetics. These mutations, known as knockdown resistance
 or kdr, have been reported in a wide diversity of arthropod species.
 Alternative splicing, in combination with kdr mutations, has been also
 associated with reduced pyrethroid efficacy. Here we report the molecular
 characterization of the VGSC in D. citri along with a survey of alternative
 splicing across developmental stages of this species. Previous studies
 demonstrated that D. citri has an exquisite enzymatic arsenal to detoxify
 insecticides resulting in reduced efficacy. The results from the current
 investigation demonstrate that target-site insensitivity is also a potential
 basis for insecticide resistance to pyrethroids in D. citri. The VGSC
 sequence and its molecular characterization should facilitate early
 elucidation of the underlying cause of an established case of resistance to
 pyrethroids. This is the first characterization of a VGSC from a hemipteran
 to this level of detail, with the majority of the previous studies on
 dipterans and lepidopterans.",
