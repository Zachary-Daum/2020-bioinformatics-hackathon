    abstract "Riboprobes (in situ hybridization) and antibodies
 (immunohistochemistry), previously used to show the upregulation of Ciona
 intestinalis (Type A) galectins (CiLgals-a, CiLgals-b) and phenoloxidase
 (CinPO2) immune-related genes, were tested on histological sections of the
 ovary. The ovarian follicles are composed of oocytes encased by follicular
 cells (FCs) and test cells (TCs). Results show the transcription upregulation
 of both CiLgals and CinPO2 genes in the vitellogenic FCs, conversely distinct
 cytolocalization of the proteins are shown. At vitellogenic stage, the
 CiLgals are localized in the FCs, in the oocyte cytoplasm, and close to the
 germinal vesicle (GV), whereas the CinPO2 was never identified in the FCs. In
 a presumptive advanced phase and at the post-vitellogenic stage the TCs
 appear to be labelled by the CinPO2 riboprobe, and the protein identified by
 the antibody suggesting an mRNA transcytosis process from FCs. At
 post-vitellogenic stage the CiLgals mainly enrich the GV nucleoplasm, whereas
 the CinPO2 is contained in TCs and in the ooplasm but never found in the GV.
 This finding sheds new light on a former paper in which TCs were reported to
 be the only CinPO2-producing cells in the ovarian follicle. Finally, CiLgals
 and CinPO2 genes transcription and proteins production seem to be associated
 with accessory cells during their differentiation from vitellogenic to
 post-vitellogenic stage. The present findings promote further research on the
 early upregulation of immune-related genes, and the potential multifunctional
 role of the produced proteins. In addition further insight on the accessory
 cells involvement in ascidian oogenesis are reported.",
