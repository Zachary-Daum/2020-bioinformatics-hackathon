    abstract "Background: Complementary and Alternative Medication (CAM) is
 commonly used among women with breast cancer to improve their quality of life
 (QoL). However, few studies examine the prevalence of CAM and its' relation
 to the patients' QoL among women with breast cancer. Methods: A
 cross-sectional study was conducted among 95 women with breast cancer at a
 tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia. The outcome measure of interest was the
 QoL. The correlation was used to assess the association between CAM use and
 QoL. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the factors
 that affect the use of CAM. The data was analysed using Statistical Package
 for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0. Results: CAM use was reported by
 81.1% of the study participants. The most commonly used CAM therapy was
 spiritual therapy 70.5%, followed by honey 36.8%, olive oil 24.2% and 23.2%
 herbal therapy. We found that those who were undergoing cancer treatment had
 a significantly higher percentage of CAM usage as compared to those not
 undergoing cancer therapy (72.6% vs. 8.4%, P=0.008). With regards to QoL,
 there was a statistically significant difference between CAM users and
 non-CAM users in global health status (73.2% vs. 64.8%, P = 0.049).
 Conclusions: CAM therapy was commonly used among women in our study sample
 which was correlated with higher overall global QoL. As CAM is widely used,
 health care providers may need to discuss the use of CAM with breast cancer
 women and be up to date on the benefits and risk of CAM use through
 well-equipped training programs and workshops.",
