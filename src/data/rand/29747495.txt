    abstract "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to determine the
 prevalence of the pathologies that caused the condemnation of pig carcasses
 in an area of intensive pig farming and Mediterranean climatology and to
 evaluate their influence in a risk-based inspection procedure for
 slaughterhouses. METHODS: A retrospective observational investigation was
 carried out from 2002 to 2016 into the pathological processes that caused the
 condemnation of pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse from South-eastern Spain.
 The seasonal effect on the causes of condemnation carcass was reported.
 Negative binomial model was used to evaluate the effect of season on the rate
 of antemortem rejections and post-mortem condemnations. Histopathological
 examinations were performed to confirm the diagnosis. RESULTS: The risk of
 antemortem rejections (0.0564%) was significantly greater in summer (risk
 ratio [RR] = 1.57). Autumn was associated with higher rate (RR = 1.69) of the
 total postmortem condemnations (0.1046%). Significantly higher rates of
 pronounced anaemia (0.0111%) were observed in summer (RR = 3.20). The main
 causes of anaemia were observed gastroesophageal ulcers and haemorrhagic
 enteropathies. Significantly highest risk of erysipelas (0.0074%) were
 observed in autumn (RR = 5.485). About other zoonosis, only eight cases
 (0.0013%) of carcasses were declared unfit due to tuberculosis lesions.
 Porcine muscular cysticercosis was not detected. Nevertheless, nonspecific
 causes such as generalized infections and emaciation represented the half of
 the condemned carcasses (50.90%). CONCLUSION: The pathologies leading to the
 condemnation of carcasses in this study can be considered representative of
 the pathologies that affect the pig population from a region with a high
 intensive production and Mediterranean climatology because this
 slaughterhouse receives a lot of animals from many farms of different size in
 a high intensive pig production zone (Mediterranean region). Increased
 knowledge of environmental factors that may foment the appearance of the
 diseases is essential for implementing inspection programs based on risk
 assessment in pig's slaughterhouses.",
