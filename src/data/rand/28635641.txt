    abstract "Pervious Paving Systems (PPS) are part of a sustainable approach
 to drainage in which excess surface water is encouraged to infiltrate through
 their structure, during which potentially toxic elements, such as metals and
 hydrocarbons are treated by biodegradation and physical entrapment and
 storage. However, it is not known where in the PPS structure these
 contaminants accumulate, which has implications for environmental health,
 particularly during maintenance, as well as consequences for the recycling of
 material from the PPS at the end-of-life. A 1 m(3) porous asphalt (PA) PPS
 test rig was monitored for 38 months after monthly additions of road sediment
 (RS) (367.5 g in total) and unused oil (430 mL in total), characteristic of
 urban loadings, were applied. Using a rainfall simulator, a typical UK
 rainfall rate of 15 mm/h was used to investigate its efficiency in dealing
 with contamination. Water quality of the effluent discharged from the rig was
 found to be suitable for discharge to most environments. On completion of the
 monitoring, a core was taken down through its surface, and samples of
 sediment and aggregate were taken. Analysis showed that most of the sediment
 remained in the surface course, with metal levels lower than the original RS,
 but higher than clean, unused aggregate or PA. However, even extrapolating
 these concentrations to 20 years' worth of in-service use (the projected life
 of PPS) did not suggest their accumulation would present an environmental
 pollution risk when carrying out maintenance of the pavement and also
 indicates that the material could be recycled at end-of-life.",
