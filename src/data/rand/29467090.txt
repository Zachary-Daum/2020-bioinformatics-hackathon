    abstract "This study was conducted to compare the mean preference scores
 for orthodontic treatment need, considering the chin position, amongst
 orthodontists, orthodontic patients and their parents. Male and female
 profile silhouettes were prepared by changing their chin prominence using
 Adobe Photoshop 7 with zero degree meridian as line of reference. Rating of
 these silhouettes was done by the three groups of raters (orthodontists,
 orthodontic patients and their parents) on a scale of four with one being no
 need of treatment and four being severe need of treatment. There was a
 statistically significant difference seen amongst orthodontists and the
 orthodontic patients and also amongst the orthodontist and the orthodontic
 patient's parents for the 2mm and 4mm chin position with orthodontists
 scoring a higher need of treatment as compared to the patients and parents.",
