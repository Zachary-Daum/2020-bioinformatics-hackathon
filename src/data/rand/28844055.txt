    abstract "(1)H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a novel advanced
 imaging technique used as an adjunct to MRI to reveal complementary
 non-invasive information about the biochemical composition of imaged tissue.
 Clinical uses in paediatrics include aiding diagnosis of brain tumours,
 neonatal disorders such as hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, inherited
 metabolic diseases, traumatic brain injury, demyelinating conditions and
 infectious brain lesions. MRS has potential to improve diagnosis and
 treatment monitoring of childhood brain tumours and other CNS diseases,
 facilitate biopsy and surgical planning, and provide prognostic biomarkers.
 MRS is employed as a research tool outside the brain in liver disease and
 disorders of muscle metabolism. The range of clinical uses is likely to
 increase with growing evidence for added value. Multicentre trials are needed
 to definitively establish the benefits of MRS in specific clinical scenarios
 and integrate this promising new technique into routine practice to improve
 patient care. This article gives a brief overview of MRS and its potential
 clinical applications, and addresses challenges surrounding translation into
 practice.",
