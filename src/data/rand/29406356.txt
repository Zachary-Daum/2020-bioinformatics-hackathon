    abstract "Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) offer a therapeutic
 strategy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Increased device
 utilization has also increased the incidence of device-related complications
 including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Multiple mechanisms have been
 proposed in the pathophysiology of continuous-flow LVAD-associated GIB
 including physiologic changes associated with high shear and nonpulsatile
 flow such as gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformations and acquired von
 Willebrand syndrome. Strategies to minimize the morbidity and mortality of
 LVAD-associated GIB are needed. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, has been
 described as an adjunct to current therapies and interventions. Factors that
 contribute to LVAD-associated GIB may be targeted by the pharmacologic
 effects of octreotide, including improved platelet aggregation, increased
 vascular resistance, and decreased splanchnic circulation. Octreotide has
 demonstrated clinical benefit in several case series and clinical trials for
 the treatment of LVAD-associated GIB. The focus of this article will be to
 review the pathophysiology of LVAD-associated GIB, discuss pharmacologic and
 nonpharmacologic treatment modalities, and review available literature on the
 role of octreotide in the management of LVAD-associated GIB.",
