    abstract "We present TRAFIC, a fully automated tool for the labeling and
 classification of brain fiber tracts. TRAFIC classifies new fibers using a
 neural network trained using shape features computed from previously traced
 and manually corrected fiber tracts. It is independent from a DTI Atlas as it
 is applied to already traced fibers. This work is motivated by medical
 applications where the process of extracting fibers from a DTI atlas, or
 classifying fibers manually is time consuming and requires knowledge about
 brain anatomy. With this new approach we were able to classify traced fiber
 tracts obtaining encouraging results. In this report we will present in
 detail the methods used and the results achieved with our approach.",
