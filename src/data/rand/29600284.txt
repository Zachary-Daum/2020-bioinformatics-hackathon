    abstract "The native Invaplex (InvaplexNAT) vaccine and adjuvant is an ion
 exchange-purified product derived from the water extract of virulent Shigella
 species. The key component of InvaplexNAT is a high-molecular-mass complex
 (HMMC) consisting of the Shigella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the invasin
 proteins IpaB and IpaC. To improve product purity and immunogenicity,
 artificial Invaplex (InvaplexAR) was developed using recombinant IpaB and
 IpaC proteins and purified Shigella LPS to assemble an HMMC consisting of all
 three components. Characterization of InvaplexAR by various methods
 demonstrated similar characteristics as the previously reported HMMC in
 InvaplexNAT. The well-defined InvaplexAR vaccine consistently contained
 greater quantities of IpaB, IpaC, and LPS than InvaplexNAT. InvaplexAR and
 InvaplexNAT immunogenicities were compared in mouse and guinea pig dose
 escalation studies. In both models, immunization induced antibody responses
 specific for InvaplexNAT and LPS while InvaplexAR induced markedly higher
 anti-IpaB and -IpaC serum IgG and IgA endpoint titers. In the murine model,
 homologous protection was achieved with 10-fold less InvaplexAR than
 InvaplexNAT and mice receiving InvaplexAR lost significantly less weight than
 mice receiving the same amount of InvaplexNAT. Moreover, mice immunized with
 InvaplexAR were protected from challenge with both homologous and
 heterologous Shigella serotypes. Guinea pigs receiving approximately 5-fold
 less InvaplexAR compared to cohorts immunized with InvaplexNAT were protected
 from ocular challenge. Furthermore, adjuvanticity previously attributed to
 InvaplexNAT was retained with InvaplexAR. The second-generation Shigella
 Invaplex vaccine, InvaplexAR, offers significant advantages over InvaplexNAT
 in reproducibility, flexible yet defined composition, immunogenicity, and
 protective efficacy. IMPORTANCEShigella species are bacteria that cause
 severe diarrheal disease worldwide, primarily in young children. Treatment of
 shigellosis includes oral fluids and antibiotics, but the high burden of
 disease, increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance, and long-term health
 consequences clearly warrant the development of an effective vaccine. One
 Shigella vaccine under development is termed the invasin complex or Invaplex
 and is designed to drive an immune response to specific antigens of the
 bacteria in an effort to protect an individual from infection. The work
 presented here describes the production and evaluation of a new generation of
 Invaplex. The improved vaccine stimulates the production of antibodies in
 immunized mice and guinea pigs and protects these animals from Shigella
 infection. The next step in the product's development will be to test the
 safety and immune response induced in humans immunized with Invaplex.",
