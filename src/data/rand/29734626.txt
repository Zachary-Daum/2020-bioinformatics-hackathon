    abstract "The contribution of main PM pollution sources and their
 geographic origin in three urban sites of the Danube macro-region (Zagreb,
 Budapest and Sofia) were determined by combining receptor and Lagrangian
 models. The source contribution estimates were obtained with the Positive
 Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model and the results were further
 examined using local wind data and backward trajectories obtained with
 FLEXPART. Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analysis was applied
 to identify the geographical source areas for the PM sources subject to
 long-range transport. Gas-to-particle transformation processes and primary
 emissions from biomass burning are the most important contributors to PM in
 the studied sites followed by re-suspension of soil (crustal material) and
 traffic. These four sources can be considered typical of the Danube
 macro-region because they were identified in all the studied locations.
 Long-range transport was observed of: a) sulphate-enriched aged aerosols,
 deriving from SO2 emissions in combustion processes in the Balkans and
 Eastern Europe and b) dust from the Saharan and Karakum deserts. The study
 highlights that PM pollution in the studied urban areas of the Danube
 macro-region is the result of both local sources and long-range transport
 from both EU and no-EU areas.",
