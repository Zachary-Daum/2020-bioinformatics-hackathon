    abstract "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the surgical,
 anatomical, and functional outcomes of sacrocolpopexy (SCP) using
 polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh versus SCP using the standard
 polypropylene (PP) mesh. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective single centre
 case-control study including female patients who underwent laparoscopic or
 abdominal SCP for POP with either PP (Cousin Biotech((R))) or PVDF
 (DynaMesh((R))-PRS) mesh between March 2005 and May 2015. Anatomical outcomes
 were assessed by the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system.
 Functional outcomes included voiding and storage urinary symptoms (VS and SS,
 respectively), urgency and stress urinary incontinence (UUI and SUI) and
 sexual dysfunction (SD). Symptoms and their impact on patients' quality of
 life (QoL) were assessed using validated questionnaires as Incontinence
 Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7), Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and Female
 Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Global patient perception of improvement (PGI-I
 questionnaire) and mesh erosion rates were also recorded. RESULTS: Of the 166
 patients enrolled, 136 could be included in the analysis: 73 in the PP group
 and 63 in the PVDF group. The mean follow-up was 94+/- 17.31 months for the
 PP and 25.6+/- 13.8 months for the PVDF group. There were no statistically
 significant differences in patient demographics and preoperative clinical
 characteristics. Postoperative anatomical correction were not significantly
 different between the two groups. The PVDF group showed superior results in
 term of storage symptoms (PVDF=0% versus PP=8.2%; p=0.02) and lower rate of
 sexual dysfunction (PVDF=0% versus PP=16,4%; p=0.001). Only 1 patient in PP
 group and 2 in PVDF group (p=0.47) presented a mesh exposure. There was no
 statistical difference in PGI-I scores (PP=1.5+/-1.0 vs PVDF=1.8+/-0.5;
 p=0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that both meshes can be safely and
 effectively used with good anatomical outcomes. Interestingly, PVDF use was
 associated with significantly less storage symptoms and sexual dysfunction.",
