    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To explore how therapists experience, react to, and
 learn from negative feedback from their clients. METHOD: Eighteen experienced
 therapists' written descriptions of episodes where they had received negative
 verbal feedback from clients were analyzed according to the Consensual
 Qualitative Research methodology. RESULTS: Receiving feedback was experienced
 as challenging, but educational. Learning was manifested in different ways:
 (a) Immediately Applied Learning-therapists improved the following therapy
 process by changing their behavior with the client, (b) Retrospectively
 Applied Learning-therapists made changes in their way of working with
 subsequent clients, and (c) Non-Applied Learning-new ideas generated by the
 experience had not been translated into behavior. We compared cases
 describing these manifestations of learning and found differences in the
 nature of the feedback and how therapists understood, reacted, and responded
 to it. CONCLUSIONS: The therapists benefitted from obtaining and being open
 to specific feedback from their clients, regulating their own emotional
 reactions, accommodating dissatisfied clients, and considering how they
 themselves contributed to negative therapy processes.",
