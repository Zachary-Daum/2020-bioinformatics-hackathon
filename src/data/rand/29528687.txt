    abstract "CONTEXT:   Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries often occur
 during jump landings and can have detrimental short-term and long-term
 functional effects on quality of life. Despite frequently performing jump
 landings, dancers have lower incidence rates of ACL injury than other
 jump-landing athletes. Planned versus unplanned activities and footwear may
 explain differing ACL-injury rates among dancers and nondancers. Still, few
 researchers have compared landing biomechanics between dancers and
 nondancers. OBJECTIVE:   To compare the landing biomechanics of dancers and
 nondancers during single-legged (SL) drop-vertical jumps. DESIGN:  
 Cross-sectional study. SETTING:   Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS:
   A total of 39 healthy participants, 12 female dancers (age = 20.9 +/- 1.8
 years, height = 166.4 +/- 6.7 cm, mass = 63.2 +/- 16.4 kg), 14 female
 nondancers (age = 20.2 +/- 0.9 years, height = 168.9 +/- 5.0 cm, mass = 61.6
 +/- 7.7 kg), and 13 male nondancers (age = 22.2 +/- 2.7 years, height = 180.6
 +/- 9.7 cm, mass = 80.8 +/- 13.2 kg). INTERVENTION(S):   Participants
 performed SL-drop-vertical jumps from a 30-cm-high box in a randomized order
 in 2 activity (planned, unplanned) and 2 footwear (shod, barefoot) conditions
 while a 3-dimensional system recorded landing biomechanics. MAIN OUTCOME
 MEASURE(S):   Overall peak sagittal-plane and frontal-plane ankle-, knee-,
 and hip-joint kinematics (joint angles) were compared across groups using
 separate multivariate analyses of variance followed by main-effects testing
 and pairwise-adjusted Bonferroni comparisons as appropriate ( P < .05).
 RESULTS:   No 3-way interactions existed for sagittal-plane or frontal-plane
 ankle (Wilks lambda = 0.85, P = .11 and Wilks lambda = 0.96, P = .55,
 respectively), knee (Wilks lambda = 1.00, P = .93 and Wilks lambda = 0.94, P
 = .36, respectively), or hip (Wilks lambda = 0.99, P = .88 and Wilks lambda =
 0.97, P = .62, respectively) kinematics. We observed no group x footwear
 interactions for sagittal-plane or frontal-plane ankle (Wilks lambda = 0.94,
 P = .43 and Wilks lambda = 0.96, P = .55, respectively), knee (Wilks lambda =
 0.97, P = .60 and Wilks lambda = 0.97, P = .66, respectively), or hip (Wilks
 lambda = 0.99, P = .91 and Wilks lambda = 1.00, P = .93, respectively)
 kinematics, and no group x activity interactions were noted for ankle
 frontal-plane (Wilks lambda = 0.92, P = .29) and sagittal- and frontal-plane
 knee (Wilks lambda = 0.99, P = .81 and Wilks lambda = 0.98, P = .77,
 respectively) and hip (Wilks lambda = 0.88, P = .13 and Wilks lambda = 0.85,
 P = .08, respectively) kinematics. A group x activity interaction (Wilks
 lambda = 0.76, P = .02) was present for ankle sagittal-plane kinematics.
 Main-effects testing revealed different ankle frontal-plane angles across
 groups ( F2,28 = 3.78, P = .04), with male nondancers having greater ankle
 inversion than female nondancers ( P = .05). CONCLUSIONS:   Irrespective of
 activity type or footwear, female nondancers landed with similar hip and knee
 kinematics but greater peak ankle eversion and less peak ankle dorsiflexion
 (ie, positions associated with greater ACL injury risk). Ankle kinematics may
 differ between groups due to different landing strategies and training used
 by dancers. Dancers' training should be examined to determine if it results
 in a reduced occurrence of biomechanics related to ACL injury during SL
 landing.",
