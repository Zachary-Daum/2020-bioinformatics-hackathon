    abstract "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of this study was to determine
 whether dynamic computed tomography (CT)-measured liver volume predicts the
 risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when the CT scans do not reveal
 evidence of HCC in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients on surveillance.
 METHODS: This retrospective multicentre cohort study included 1,246 patients
 who received entecavir and regular HCC surveillance in three tertiary
 referral centres in South Korea. Liver volumes were measured on portal venous
 phase CT images. A nomogram was developed based on Cox independent predictors
 and externally validated. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic
 (ROC) analysis was performed for comparison with previous prediction models.
 RESULTS: Patients who received dynamic CT studies during surveillance had
 significantly higher risk for HCC compared to patients without CT studies
 (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1; p < 0.001). Expected/measured liver volume ratio
 was an independent predictor of HCC (HR = 4.2; p = 0.002) in addition to age,
 sex and cirrhosis. The nomogram based on the four predictors discriminated
 risks for HCC (HR = 4.1 and 6.0 in derivation and validation cohort,
 respectively, for volume score > 150; p < 0.001). Time-dependent ROC analysis
 confirmed better performance of the volume score compared to HCC prediction
 models with conventional predictors (integrated area under curve = 0.758 vs.
 0.661-0.712; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CT-measured liver volume is an
 independent predictor of future HCC, and nomogram-based liver volume score
 may stratify the risks of HCC in CHB patients who showed negative CT findings
 for HCC during surveillance.",
