    abstract "Most of cancer-related deaths are due to lung cancer, and there
 is a need for reliable prognosis biomarkers to predict stages in lung
 adenocarcinoma cases. Recently, microRNAs are found to have potential as both
 biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung cancer. As evidence suggests
 microRNA dysregulations are implicated in many cancer malignancies, it is
 important to consider the changes in miRNA-target associations among
 different lung cancer biological states. We proposed a novel clustering
 strategy to identify groups of miRNAs with similar dysregulated targets.
 Then, we incorporated the learned clusters of miRNA as prior knowledge to a
 Sparse Group Lasso classifier to improve classification results, thereby
 leading to more relevant selection of microRNA biomarkers. We apply the
 method to the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma dataset. In cross-validation tests,
 the AUC rate for each stages is 1.0, 0.71, 0.68, 0.64, and 0.90 for normal,
 Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV, respectively. Among the candidate
 miRNAs selected in the model, 87% are reported to be related to Lung
 Adenocarcinoma. Further result demonstrates that clustering miRNAs by
 considering the dysregulation between miRNAs and mRNA targets leads to
 biomarkers with higher precision and recall rate to known lung adenocarcinoma
 miRNAs.",
