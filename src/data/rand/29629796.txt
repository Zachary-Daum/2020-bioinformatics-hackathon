    abstract "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to discuss the
 advances in CT acquisition and image postprocessing as they apply to imaging
 the pancreas and to conceptualize the role of radiogenomics and machine
 learning in pancreatic imaging. CONCLUSION: CT is the preferred imaging
 modality for assessment of pancreatic diseases. Recent advances in CT
 (dual-energy CT, CT perfusion, CT volumetry, and radiogenomics) and emerging
 computational algorithms (machine learning) have the potential to further
 increase the value of CT in pancreatic imaging.",
