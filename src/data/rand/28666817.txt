    abstract "While approximately half of all qualified hospital pharmacist
 independent prescribers (PIPs) in Scotland are active prescribers, there are
 major differences in prescribing activity across geographical areas. This
 study aimed to explore, through focus groups, interviews and a questionnaire,
 hospital PIPs' perceptions of factors associated with prescribing activity
 and to investigate the infrastructure required to better support active
 prescribing by PIPs. Findings reinforced the perceived positive impact of
 supportive pharmacy leadership within the organisation, recognition that
 prescribing is integral to the clinical pharmacist role and a work
 environment conducive to prescribing.",
