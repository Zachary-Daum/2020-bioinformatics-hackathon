    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the associations between fixed-term
 employment and health (work ability and mental health) and behaviors
 (engagement and performance). Psychological contract fulfilment (PCF) and
 breach (PCB) are investigated as potential mediators of these associations.
 METHODS: Seven hundred workers employed on fixed-term contracts from a broad
 range of organizations participated in the study. The Structural Equation
 Model was performed to analyze the data. RESULTS: Mediation analyses revealed
 that good physical and mental health and productivity are more likely to be
 achieved by those workers who perform non-manual work and (to some extent)
 accept their contracts because they experience high levels of PCF and low
 levels of PCB. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the lack of physical workload,
 psychological contract fulfilment has been revealed as yet another
 significant mediator between a higher socioeconomic position and good health
 and productivity of fixed-term workers.",
