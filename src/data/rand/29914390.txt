    abstract "BACKGROUND: Congenital NBCe1A deficiency with the SLC4A4
 mutation causes severe proximal renal tubular acidosis, which often comprises
 extrarenal symptoms, such as intellectual disability and developmental delay,
 glaucoma, cataract and band keratopathy. To date, almost all mutations have
 been found to be homozygous mutations located in exons. CASE PRESENTATION: We
 performed direct nucleotide sequencing analysis of exons and exon-intron
 boundary regions of the SLC4A4 in a patient presenting with severe renal
 proximal tubule acidosis, glaucoma and intellectual disability and her
 parents without these signs. The examination revealed compound heterozygous
 mutations in exon-intron boundary regions, c.1076 + 3A > C and c.1772 - 2A >
 T, neither of which have been reported previously. While the former mutation
 was found in the mother, the latter was found in the father. The transcript
 of the SLC4A4 gene was almost undetectable, and the patient was also
 diagnosed with Turner's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two novel SLC4A4
 mutations, c.1076 + 3A > C and c.1772 - 2A > T. When presented in a compound
 heterozygous state, these mutations caused a phenotype of severe renal
 proximal tubular acidosis along with glaucoma and mental retardation. This is
 the first report of congenital proximal renal tubular acidosis carrying
 compound heterozygous SLC4A4 mutations in exon-intron boundary regions. We
 suggest that an mRNA surveillance mechanism, nonsense-mediated RNA decay,
 following aberrant splicing was the reason that the SLC4A4 transcript was
 almost undetectable in the proband.",
