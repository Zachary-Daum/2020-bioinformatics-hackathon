    abstract "Transpeptidation of surface proteins catalyzed by the
 transpeptidase sortase plays a critical role in the infection process of
 Gram-positive pathogen, and probing sortase activity and screening its
 inhibitors are of great significance to fundamental biological research and
 pharmaceutical development, especially novel antivirulence drug design.
 Herein, we developed a novel fluorescent biosensor to detect sortase activity
 based on a transpeptidation-triggered assembly of tripartite split green
 fluorescent protein (split GFP). Peptide P1, composed the 10th beta-sheet of
 GFP (GFP10) and the sortase A (SrtA) recognition sequence (LPETX), and
 peptide P2, the 11th beta-sheet of GFP (GFP11) with oligoglycine at
 N-terminal, were designed and synthesized, respectively. Existence of SrtA
 enables P1 and P2 to ligate into one peptide, which could spontaneously bind
 to GFP1-9 (the 1st to 9th beta-sheets of GFP) and assemble into functional
 GFP. Thus, the sortase-catalyzed transpeptidation can switch on the
 fluorescence signal of GFP. The method was successfully applied to detect
 SrtA activity with a low detection limit of 0.16 nM and for its inhibition
 measurement. Moreover, the feasibility of the proposed assay was further
 expanded to detect SrtA in human blood and further Gram-positive pathogens
 analysis in frozen food. Our method, using tripartite split GFP as a readout,
 is facile, label-free, and sensitive and exhibits great potential as a
 promising platform for sortase detection and inhibitor screening.",
