    abstract "One mandate of the Affordable Care Act is continued support of
 workplace wellness programs. A tool used to encourage behavior change is a
 health risk appraisal (HRA). However, research indicates there is limited
 benefit to HRAs unless supported by additional health interventions. The
 purpose of these two pilot studies was to examine effects of the individual
 HRA personalized feedback, including the perceived value of the feedback and
 its influence on behavior change. Six months after completing and receiving
 HRA personalized feedback, participants in two separate Indiana organizations
 answered survey questions about the HRA value, motivational influence, and
 ability to prompt behavior change. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests,
 analyses of variance, and factor analysis were used to analyze the influence
 of various factors and test the relationship between HRA generated feedback
 and these characteristics. The majority of respondents indicated the HRA was
 helpful with 69% (Study 1, n = 51) and 63% (Study 2, n = 116) of the
 respondents reporting an attempted behavior change. Preliminary results
 indicate that completion of an HRA with feedback alone may be beneficial in
 prompting behavior change.",
