    abstract "BACKGROUND: The Public Health Intervention Wheel (PHIW) is a
 population-based practice model that encompasses three levels of practice
 (community, systems, and individual/family) and 17 public health
 interventions. Each intervention and practice level contributes to improving
 population health. Public health nurses (PHNs) provide care at the three
 levels of practice. Prevention of falls is a public health issue and the
 majority of falls happen at home. Therefore, prevention and management of
 falls in the community could benefit from a public health systems approach by
 PHNs underpinned by the PHIW. CASE PRESENTATION: A hypothetical case is
 presented of a 78-year-old gentleman who had a fall which resulted in a
 fractured right acetabulum and surgery before being discharged home. METHODS:
 The aim of this paper was to use a case summary to illustrate PHN practice in
 the context of the PHIW as applied to falls management and prevention. This
 paper focuses on fall incidence and PHN response in Ireland and Norway. The
 PHIW is described and relevant interventions from the PHIW are applied to PHN
 practice in managing the case. CONCLUSIONS: The PHIW model provides insight
 into the potential scope of public health nursing in falls, articulating PHN
 practice in the community.",
