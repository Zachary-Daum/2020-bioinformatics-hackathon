    abstract "Screening and treating correctional populations for HIV and HCV
 infections is essential to successfully addressing both epidemics in the USA.
 The prevalence of HIV and HCV infection is high in prisons and jails due to
 increased rates of incarceration among disproportionately affected groups
 such as injection drug users. Through a search of the published and grey
 literature and surveying persons overseeing health programs in prisons, we
 collected data on efforts to determine prevalence first for HIV and then for
 HCV. Prevalence of both infections varies geographically and temporally,
 reflecting epidemics in the community as well as local law enforcement
 policies. We estimate that seroprevalence of HCV in 2015 for persons in U.S.
 prisons averaged 18%, over tenfold greater than HIV. For both, transmission
 and acquisition during incarceration are rare. Screening can identify
 previously undetected cases: the efficiency of a testing strategy depends on
 local conditions. Universal opt-out screening of entrants is usually best as
 conducting risk-based screening has challenges. With HCV, the advent of
 highly effective regimens makes cure feasible. Treatment within facilities
 has the potential to reduce HCV incidence and disease burden in the
 community, especially in difficult-to-reach populations. The extraordinarily
 high cost of HCV treatment regimens and lack of political will are the main
 barriers to treatment expansion. Just as community-wide HIV viral suppression
 has required correctional/community coordination, elimination of HCV
 infection in the USA will depend on a thoughtful, well-funded effort to
 manage this disease in populations interacting with the criminal justice
 system.",
