    abstract "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Markers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
 transition (EMT) in gastric tumor tissues are associated with poor patient
 outcomes. We performed a screen to identify pharmacologic compounds that kill
 gastric cancer cells with EMT-associated gene expression patterns and
 investigate their mechanisms. METHODS: We identified 29 gastric cancer cell
 lines with a gene expression signature previously associated with an EMT
 subtype, based on data from RNA sequence analyses, and confirmed the
 mesenchymal phenotypes of 7 lines (Hs746T, SNU1750, MKN1, SK4, SNU484,
 SNU668, and YCC11), based on invasive activity and protein markers. We
 screened 1,345 compounds for their ability to kill cells with the EMT
 signature compared with cell lines without this pattern. We tested the
 effects of identified compounds in BALB/c nude mice bearing GA077 tumors;
 mice were given intraperitoneal injections of the compound or vehicle
 (control) twice daily for 24 days and tumor growth was monitored. Proteins
 associated with the toxicity of the compounds were overexpressed in MKN1 and
 SNU484 cells or knocked down in MKN45 and SNU719 using small interfering
 RNAs. We performed immunohistochemical analyses of 942 gastric cancer tissues
 and investigated associations between EMT markers and protein expression
 patterns. RESULTS: The nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitor FK866
 killed 6 of 7 gastric cancer cell lines with EMT-associated gene expression
 signatures but not gastric cancer cells without this signature. The 6
 EMT-subtype gastric cell lines expressed significantly low levels of
 nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), which makes the cells
 hypersensitive to nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibition. Gastric
 cell lines that expressed higher levels of NAPRT, regardless of EMT markers,
 were sensitized to FK866 after knockdown of NAPRT, whereas overexpression of
 NAPRT in deficient EMT cell lines protected them from FK866-mediated
 toxicity. Administration of FK866 to nude mice with tumors grown from GA077
 cells (human gastric cancer tumors of the EMT subtype) led to tumor
 regression in 2 weeks; FK866 did not affect tumors grown from MKN45 cells
 without the EMT expression signature. Loss of NAPRT might promote the EMT,
 because it stabilizes beta-catenin. We correlated the EMT gene expression
 signature with lower levels of NAPRT in 942 gastric tumors from patients; we
 also found lower levels of NAPRT mRNA in colorectal, pancreatic, and lung
 adenocarcinoma tissues with the EMT gene expression signature. CONCLUSIONS:
 FK866 selectively kills gastric cancer cells with an EMT gene expression
 signature by inhibiting nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in cells with
 NAPRT deficiency. Loss of NAPRT expression, frequently through promoter
 hypermethylation, is observed in many gastric tumors of the EMT subtype.
 FK866 might be used to treat patients with tumors of this subtype.",
