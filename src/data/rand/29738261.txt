    abstract "BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling of breast cancer has
 demonstrated the importance of stromal response in determining the prognosis
 of invasive breast cancer. The host response to breast cancer is of
 increasing interest to pathologists and may be a future focus for novel
 pharmacological treatments. METHODS: This study describes the pattern of
 distribution of stromal myofibroblasts using immunostains for CD10 and smooth
 muscle actin (SMA) in 50 primary breast cancers and their matched nodal
 metastases (68.6% nodes positive and 31.4% nodes negative). The stroma within
 the tumor (intratumoral) and at the advancing tumor edge (peri-tumoral) was
 studied in both primary and nodal sites. A simple quantitative scoring system
 was employed for both immunostains. The correlation between expression of
 these markers by stromal cells and standard pathological prognostic factors
 of stage, grade, hormone receptor and Her-2 status was analysed. RESULTS:
 SMA-positive stromal cells were more abundant in peri-tumoral stroma compared
 with intratumoral stroma in both primary and metastatic lesions. SMA
 expression in the lymph node metastases showed a significant correlation with
 tumor stage. SMA expression in peri-tumoral stroma correlated with Her-2
 status. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that myofibroblasts,
 particularly those expressing SMA, might potentiate the progression of the
 carcinomatous process especially in nodal metastases. Thus these cells may be
 a potential therapeutic target.",
