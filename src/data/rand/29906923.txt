    abstract "When a spatially uniform system that displays a liquid-crystal
 ordering on a two-dimensional surface is confined inside a rectangular box,
 the liquid crystal direction field develops inhomogeneous textures
 accompanied by topological defects because of the geometric frustrations. We
 show that the rich variety of nematic textures and defect patterns found in
 recent experimental and theoretical studies can be classified by the
 solutions of the rather fundamental, extended Onsager model. This is
 critically examined based on the determined free energies of different defect
 states, as functions of a few relevant, dimensionless geometric parameters.",
