    abstract "Pritelivir, a helicase-primase inhibitor, has excellent in vitro
 and in vivo activity against human herpes simplex virus (HSV). Mice lethally
 infected with HSV type 1 or 2, including acyclovir-resistant strains, were
 treated 72 h after infection for 7 days with pritelivir or acyclovir. Both
 drugs were administered orally twice daily either alone or in combination.
 Dosages of pritelivir from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg reduced mortality (P < 0.001)
 against HSV-1, E-377. With an acyclovir resistant HSV-1, 11360, pritelivir at
 1 and 3 mg/kg increased survival (P < 0.005). With HSV-2, MS infected mice,
 all dosages higher than the 0.3 mg/kg dose of pritelivir were effective (P <
 0.005). For acyclovir resistant HSV-2, strain 12247, pritelivir dosages of
 1-3 mg/kg significantly improved survival (P < 0.0001). Combination therapies
 of pritelivir at 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg/dose with acyclovir (10 mg/kg/dose) were
 protective (P < 0.0001) when compared to the vehicle treated group against
 HSV-2, strain MS (in line with previous data using HSV-1). An increased mean
 days to death (P < 0.05) was also observed and was indicative of a potential
 synergy. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed to determine pritelivir
 concentrations and a dose dependent relationship was found in both plasma and
 brain samples regardless of infection status or time of initiation of dosing.
 In summary, pritelivir was shown to be active when treatment was delayed to
 72 h post viral inoculation and appeared to synergistically inhibit mortality
 in this model in combination with acyclovir. We conclude pritelivir has
 potent and resistance-breaking antiviral efficacy with potential for the
 treatment of potentially life-threatening HSV type 1 and 2 infections,
 including herpes simplex encephalitis.",
