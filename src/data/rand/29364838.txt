    abstract "Nitroreductases (NRs) hold promise for converting nitroaromatics
 to aromatic amines. Nitroaromatic reduction rate increases with Hammett
 substituent constant for NRs from two different subgroups, confirming
 substrate identity as a key determinant of reactivity. Amine yields were low,
 but compounds yielding amines tend to have a large pi system and electron
 withdrawing substituents. Therefore, we also assessed the prospects of
 varying the enzyme. Several different subgroups of NRs include members able
 to produce aromatic amines. Comparison of four NR subgroups shows that they
 provide contrasting substrate binding cavities with distinct constraints on
 substrate position relative to the flavin. The unique architecture of the NR
 dimer produces an enormous contact area which we propose provides the
 stabilization needed to offset the costs of insertion of the active sites
 between the monomers. Thus, we propose that the functional diversity included
 in the NR superfamily stems from the chemical versatility of the flavin
 cofactor in conjunction with a structure that permits tremendous active site
 variability. These complementary properties make NRs exceptionally promising
 enzymes for development for biocatalysis in prodrug activation and conversion
 of nitroaromatics to valuable aromatic amines. We provide a framework for
 identifying NRs and substrates with the greatest potential to advance.",
