    abstract "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients
 infected by HIV-1. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable plasma
 viral load (PVL). Initial ART should be based on a combination of 3 drugs,
 including 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir in either
 of its two formulations plus emtricitabine or abacavir plus lamivudine) and
 another drug from a different family. Four of the recommended regimens, all
 of which have an integrase inhibitor as the third drug (dolutegravir,
 elvitegravir boosted with cobicistat or raltegravir), are considered
 preferential, whereas a further 3 regimens (based on elvitegravir/cobicistat,
 rilpivirine, or darunavir boosted with cobicistat or ritonavir) are
 considered alternatives. We present the reasons and criteria for switching
 ART in patients with an undetectable PVL and in those who present virological
 failure, in which case salvage ART should include 3 (or at least 2) drugs
 that are fully active against HIV. We also update the criteria for ART in
 specific situations (acute infection, HIV-2 infection, pregnancy) and
 comorbidities (tuberculosis or other opportunistic infections, kidney
 disease, liver disease and cancer).",
