    abstract "INTRODUCTION: We previously demonstrated that cyclic
 AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates neuronal nitric oxide
 synthase (nNOS) at Ser(1412) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus after forebrain
 ischemia; this phosphorylation event activates NOS activity and might
 contribute to depression after cerebral ischemia. In this study, we revealed
 chronological and topographical changes in the phosphorylation of nNOS at
 Ser(1412) immediately after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: In a rat
 single-hemorrhage model of SAH, the hippocampus and adjacent cortex were
 collected up to 24 h after SAH. Samples from rats that were not injected with
 autologous blood were used as controls. NOS was partially purified from crude
 samples via an ADP-agarose gel. Levels of nNOS, nNOS phosphorylated at
 Ser(1412) (p-nNOS), PKA, and p-PKA at Thr(197) were studied in the rat
 hippocampus and cortex using Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry.
 RESULTS: According to the Western blot analysis, levels of p-nNOS at
 Ser(1412) were significantly increased in the hippocampus, but not in the
 cortex, between 1 and 3 h after SAH. Immunohistochemistry revealed the
 phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser(1412) and PKA at Thr(197) in the dentate
 gyrus, but not in the CA1 area, 1 h after SAH. An injection of saline instead
 of blood also significantly increased levels of p-nNOS at Ser(1412) in the
 hippocampus 1 h after the injection. CONCLUSIONS: An immediate increase in
 intracranial pressure (ICP) might induce transient cerebral ischemia and
 promote the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser(1412) in the dentate
 gyrus. This signal transduction pathway induces the excessive production of
 nitric oxide (NO) and might be involved in cognitive dysfunction after SAH.",
