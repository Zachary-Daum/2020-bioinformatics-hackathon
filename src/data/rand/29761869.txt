    abstract "Growing evidences suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) played
 important roles in the development of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD).
 However, the expression level and function of miR-665 in IDD remain unknown.
 In this study, we showed that the expression level of miR-665 was upregulated
 in degenerative human NP samples. In addition, miR-665 expression level
 gradually increased with the exacerbation of disc degeneration grade.
 Moreover, miR-665 expression level was positively associated with the
 Pfirrmann grade. Ectopic expression of miR-665 promoted NP cell growth.
 Furthermore, miR-665 overexpression decreased aggrecan and Col II expression
 and ectopic expression of miR-665 increased MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression in NP
 cell. We identified growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) was a direct
 target gene of miR-665 in NP cell and enforced expression of miR-665
 decreased GDF5 expression. Elevated expression of miR-665 enhanced NP cell
 proliferation and decreased aggrecan and Col II expression. In addition,
 ectopic expression of miR-665 increased MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression through
 inhibiting GDF5 expression in NP cells. These results suggested that
 dysregulated miR-665 expression might act an important role in the
 development of IDD.",
