    abstract "Consumption of cooked/processed meat and ethanol are lifestyle
 risk factors in the aetiology of breast cancer. Cooking meat generates
 heterocyclic amines such as 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
 (PhIP). Epidemiology, mechanistic and animal studies indicate that PhIP is a
 mammary carcinogen that could be causally linked to breast cancer incidence;
 PhIP is DNA damaging, mutagenic and oestrogenic. PhIP toxicity involves
 cytochrome P450 (CYP1 family)-mediated metabolic activation to DNA-damaging
 species, and transcriptional responses through Aryl hydrocarbon receptor
 (AhR) and estrogen-receptor-alpha (ER-alpha). Ethanol consumption is a
 modifiable lifestyle factor strongly associated with breast cancer risk.
 Ethanol toxicity involves alcohol dehydrogenase metabolism to reactive
 acetaldehyde, and is also a substrate for CYP2E1, which when uncoupled
 generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. Here, using human
 mammary cells that differ in estrogen-receptor status, we explore
 genotoxicity of PhIP and ethanol and mechanisms behind this toxicity.
 Treatment with PhIP (10(-7)-10(-4) M) significantly induced genotoxicity
 (micronuclei formation) preferentially in ER-alpha positive human mammary
 cell lines (MCF-7, ER-alpha+) compared to MDA-MB-231 (ER-alpha-) cells.
 PhIP-induced CYP1A2 in both cell lines but CYP1B1 was selectively induced in
 ER-alpha(+) cells. ER-alpha inhibition in MCF-7 cells attenuated
 PhIP-mediated micronuclei formation and CYP1B1 induction. PhIP-induced CYP2E1
 and ROS via ER-alpha-STAT-3 pathway, but only in ER-alpha (+) MCF-7 cells.
 Importantly, simultaneous treatments of physiological concentrations ethanol
 (10(-3)-10(-1) M) with PhIP (10(-7)-10(-4) M) increased oxidative stress and
 genotoxicity in MCF-7 cells, compared to the individual chemicals.
 Collectively, these data offer a mechanistic basis for the increased risk of
 breast cancer associated with dietary cooked meat and ethanol lifestyle
 choices.",
