    abstract "Atomic-resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in
 scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has recently been shown to
 be a powerful approach to investigate local chemistry of nanoscale structures
 quantitatively. While most of the studies have been focused on the
 quantification of the chemical composition in bulk crystals, few were
 discussed on interfaces. In this study, we theoretically explored the
 applicability of STEM EDS for the quantification of local chemistry in grain
 boundaries (GBs), where the electron channeling can be dramatically changed
 compared with the bulk due to non-periodic atomic arrangement. We find that:
 (1) line scan analysis across the GBs or mapping analysis, which have been
 widely used for interface analysis, sometimes leads to misinterpretation of
 true interface chemistry. (2) Tilting the specimen, which is effective to
 reduce the effects of scattering, is not always useful for the quantification
 of GBs. (3) EDS analysis covering the whole GB structure unit, such as using
 a box scan, can provide true chemical information. Our study provides useful
 insights into characterization of interface chemistry using STEM EDS.",
