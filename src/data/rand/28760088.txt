    abstract "Previous research has found differences in sexual behavior and
 types of sexual offending by offense category and racial/ethnic group. The
 present study examined effects of offense category, victim age, and
 race/ethnicity on sexual behavior. Data from 561 confined adolescents
 adjudicated for illegal sexual behavior (AISBs) and adolescents adjudicated
 for illegal nonsexual behavior (AINBs) were included in the present study. A
 hierarchical multinomial logistic regression was run to test whether sexual
 experiences and behaviors differentially predicted AINBs, AISBs with child
 victims, and AISBs with peer/adult victims. Results supported the utility of
 distinguishing AISBs by victim age. Comparisons between AISBs and AINBs
 indicated AISBs had more sexual abuse and were more sexually restricted,
 whereas AINBs reported more sexual behavior, reflecting a finding potentially
 mirroring sexual development, sexual experiences, and caregiver approaches to
 discussing sexuality. Over 60% of AINBs and 30% of AISBs reported behaviors
 that could be classified as distribution of child pornography. Within the
 group of AISBs, select racial/ethnic group differences emerged such that
 European American participants were more likely to have had intrafamilial
 sexual experiences and were far less likely to have had vaginal intercourse
 than African American AISBs. Future directions and implications regarding
 policies related to sexual education and sexting are discussed.",
