    abstract "Post-treatment of anaerobic reactor effluent with maturation
 ponds is a good option for small to medium-sized communities in tropical
 climates. The treatment line investigated, operating in Brazil, with an
 equivalent capacity to treat domestic sewage from 250 inhabitants, comprised
 a upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor followed by two shallow maturation
 ponds (unbaffled and baffled) and a granular rock filter (decreasing grain
 size) in series, requiring an area of only 1.5 m(2) inhabitant(-1). With an
 overall hydraulic retention time of only 6.7 days, the performance was
 excellent for a natural treatment system. Based on over two years of
 continuous monitoring, median removal efficiencies were: biochemical oxygen
 demand = 93%, chemical oxygen demand = 79%, total suspended solids = 87%,
 ammonia = 43% and Escherichia coli = 6.1 log units. The final effluent
 complied with European discharge standards and WHO guidelines for some forms
 of irrigation, and appeared to be a suitable alternative for treating
 domestic sewage for small communities in warm areas, especially in developing
 countries.",
