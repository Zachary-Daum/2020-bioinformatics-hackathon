    abstract "A multicentre, single-dose study enrolled 12 previously treated
 patients with moderately severe to severe (factor IX [FIX] levels </=2 IU/dl)
 haemophilia B to assess FIX pharmacokinetics after nonacog alfa
 administration and to evaluate the impact of length of sampling time on
 half-life (t(1/2)). After refraining from FIX replacement for four days,
 patients received 50 IU/kg as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 10 minutes.
 Blood samples were collected predose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 24, 50, 72,
 and 96 h post dose. Tolerability and safety were assessed by monitoring
 adverse events and were subsequently summary tabulated. FIX activity was
 measured by a one-stage clotting assay with a lower limit of quantification
 of 0.010 IU/ml, and inhibitors to FIX were measured using the Bethesda assay.
 Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis and
 were descriptively summarised. Half-life estimates were calculated first
 using all available data, then excluding 96-h observations (truncated at 72
 h) and, finally, excluding both 72- and 96-h observations (truncated at 50
 h). No patient was positive for FIX inhibitors. No treatment-emergent adverse
 events were reported. Prolonging the duration of the sample collection to 96
 h resulted in a terminal t(1/2) estimate of 39.6 +/-7.4 h in the eight
 patients aged 18 years and older, which was longer than the estimates
 obtained using shorter periods of observation: 29.6 +/- 5.5 h (truncated at
 72 h) and 27.2 +/- 7.0 h (truncated at 50 h). To accurately assess an adult
 patient's t(1/2), sampling should be continued for at least 96 h.",
