    abstract "Sepsis is a disease that occurs as a result of systemic
 inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in response to an infection,
 contributing to multiple organ dysfunction and a high mortality rate.
 Interleukin-lbeta (IL-1beta) is a cytokine that plays critical roles in
 inflammation and cardiac dysfunction during severe sepsis. Intermedin1-53
 (IMD1-53) has been recently discovered to possess potential endogenous
 anti-inflammatory and strong cardiovascular protective effects. To
 investigate whether IMD1-53 can inhibit the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1beta pathway
 to alleviate cardiac injury and rescue heart function, sepsis was induced in
 vivo by caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery, and lipopolysaccharides
 were used as septic stressors for cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in vitro. The
 expressions of IMD1-53 receptors in sepsis rat heart were increased. After
 IMD1-53 treatment, inflammation caused by sepsis in vivo was greatly reduced,
 as shown by the downregulation of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
 containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), nucleotide-binding domain and
 leucine-rich repeat containing family, pyrin containing 3 (NLRP3),
 pro-IL-1beta, caspase 1, and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB
 (NF-kB) protein levels. In addition, cardiac function was significantly
 improved and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) increased by 34.8% (P <
 0.05) which almost back to normal. Surprisingly, IMD1-53 inhibited cell
 apoptosis, as caspase 3 activity and Bax expression was significantly reduced
 in the heart upon IMD1-53 treatment. IMD1-53 abolished the upregulation of
 ASC, NLRP3, and caspase 1 protein levels in CFs induced by lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS). IMD1-53 increased cell survival rates and inhibited IL-1beta
 production in the cell culture medium. IMD1-53 can protect against
 inflammation and heart injury during sepsis via attenuating the
 NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1beta pathway.",
