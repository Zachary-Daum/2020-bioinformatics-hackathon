    abstract "Proper floral patterning, including the number and position of
 floral organs in most plant species, is tightly controlled by the precise
 regulation of the persistence and size of floral meristems (FMs). In
 Arabidopsis, two known feedback pathways, one composed of WUSCHEL (WUS) and
 CLAVATA3 (CLV3) and the other composed of AGAMOUS (AG) and WUS, spatially and
 temporally control floral stem cells, respectively. However, mounting
 evidence suggests that other factors, including phytohormones, are also
 involved in floral meristem regulation. Here, we show that the boundary gene
 SUPERMAN (SUP) bridges floral organogenesis and floral meristem determinacy
 in another pathway that involves auxin signaling. SUP interacts with
 components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and fine-tunes local auxin
 signaling by negatively regulating the expression of the auxin biosynthesis
 genes YUCCA1/4 (YUC1/4). In sup mutants, derepressed local YUC1/4 activity
 elevates auxin levels at the boundary between whorls 3 and 4, which leads to
 an increase in the number and the prolonged maintenance of floral stem cells,
 and consequently an increase in the number of reproductive organs. Our work
 presents a new floral meristem regulatory mechanism, in which SUP, a boundary
 gene, coordinates floral organogenesis and floral meristem size through
 fine-tuning auxin biosynthesis.",
