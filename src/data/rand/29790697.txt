    abstract "BACKGROUND: Cancer cells are dependent on aerobic glycolysis for
 energy production and increased glutamine consumption. HIF-1alpha and c-MYC
 transcription factors regulate the expression of glycolytic and
 glutaminolytic genes. Their activity may be repressed by SIRT6. Head and neck
 carcinomas show frequent activation of c-MYC function and SIRT6
 down-regulation, which contributes to a strong dependence on glucose and
 glutamine availability. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the
 influence of HIF-1alpha and c-MYC inhibitors (KG-548 and 10058-F4,
 respectively) and potential SIRT6 inducers - resveratrol and its synthetic
 derivative DMU-212 with the effect of glycolysis and glutaminolysis
 inhibitors (2-deoxyglucose and aminooxyacetic acid, respectively) on the
 metabolism and expression of metabolic enzymes in FaDu hypopharyngeal
 carcinoma cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cell viability was assessed by means
 of an MTT assay. Quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of
 SIRT6, HIF-1alpha, c-MYC, GLUT1, SLC1A5, HK2, PFKM, PKM2, LDHA, GLS, and GDH.
 The release of glycolysis and glutaminolysis end-products into the culture
 medium - lactate and ammonia, respectively - was assessed using standard
 colorimetric assays. RESULTS: Lactate production was significantly inhibited
 by 10058-F4, KG-548, and 2-deoxyglucose. Moreover, 10058-F4 strongly reduced
 the amount of ammonia release. The effects of 10058-F4 activity can be
 attributed to a reduction in the expression of PKM2 and LDHA. On the other
 hand, the induction of SIRT6 expression by resveratrol and DMU-212 was not
 associated with significant modulation of the expression of metabolic
 enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of this study indicate that the
 inhibition of c-MYC may be considered to be a promising strategy of the
 modulation of cancer-related metabolic changes in head and neck carcinomas.",
