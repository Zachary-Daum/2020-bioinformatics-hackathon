    abstract "Recently, selection in pigs has been focused on improving the
 lean meat content in carcasses; this focus has been most evident in breeds
 constituting a paternal component in breeding. Such sire-breeds are used to
 improve the meat quantity of cross-breed pig lines. However, even in one
 breed, a significant variation in the meatiness level can be observed. In the
 present study, the comprehensive analysis of genes and microRNA expression
 profiles in porcine muscle tissue was applied to identify the genetic
 background of meat content. The comparison was performed between whole gene
 expression and miRNA profiles of muscle tissue collected from two sire-line
 pig breeds (Pietrain, Hampshire). The RNA-seq approach allowed the
 identification of 627 and 416 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
 pig groups differing in terms of loin weight between Pietrain and Hampshire
 breeds, respectively. The comparison of miRNA profiles showed differential
 expression of 57 microRNAs for Hampshire and 34 miRNAs for Pietrain pigs.
 Next, 43 genes and 18 miRNAs were selected as differentially expressed in
 both breeds and potentially related to muscle development. According to Gene
 Ontology analysis, identified DEGs and microRNAs were involved in the
 regulation of the cell cycle, fatty acid biosynthesis and regulation of the
 actin cytoskeleton. The most deregulated pathways dependent on muscle mass
 were the Hippo signalling pathway connected with the TGF-beta signalling
 pathway and controlling organ size via the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated
 proteolysis, cell proliferation and apoptosis. The identified target genes
 were also involved in pathways such as the FoxO signalling pathway,
 signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells and the PI3K-Akt
 signalling pathway. The obtained results indicate molecular mechanisms
 controlling porcine muscle growth and development. Identified genes (SOX2,
 SIRT1, KLF4, PAX6 and genes belonging to the transforming growth factor beta
 superfamily) could be considered candidate genes for determining muscle mass
 in pigs.",
