    abstract "We compared the influence of a weapon's presence on eyewitnesses
' memory for a White versus a Black male perpetrator. Prior data indicate that
 unusual objects in visual scenes attract attention and that a weapon's effect
 depends on how unusual it seems within the context in which it appears.
 Therefore, given the stereotype linking Black men and weapons, we predicted a
 weaker weapon focus effect with the Black perpetrator. The results of
 Experiment 1 supported this hypothesis using White and Black witnesses.
 Moreover, in Experiment 2 the weapon focus effect became nonsignificant when
 the Black perpetrator wore a style of clothing that is strongly associated
 with Black men. We propose that observing an armed Black perpetrator
 automatically activates a stereotype linking Black men with weapons and
 crime, which in turn reduces the perceived unusualness of the weapon and thus
 its ability to attract attention.",
