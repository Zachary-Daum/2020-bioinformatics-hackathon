    abstract "Background: Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) might be
 manifested as structural changes in bone through modification, adaptation or
 direct destruction. We propose to use Local Binary Pattern (LBP)
 characteristics and histogram-oriented gradients on the recorded images as a
 diagnostic tool in TMD assessment. Material and Methods: CBCT images of 66
 patients (132 joints) with TMD and 66 normal cases (132 joints) were
 collected and 2 coronal cut prepared from each condyle, although images were
 limited to head of mandibular condyle. In order to extract features of
 images, first we use LBP and then histogram of oriented gradients. To reduce
 dimensionality, the linear algebra Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is
 applied to the feature vectors matrix of all images. For evaluation, we used
 K nearest neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayesian and Random
 Forest classifiers. We used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) to
 evaluate the hypothesis. Results: K nearest neighbor classifier achieves a
 very good accuracy (0.9242), moreover, it has desirable sensitivity (0.9470)
 and specificity (0.9015) results, when other classifiers have lower accuracy,
 sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: We proposed a fully automatic
 approach to detect TMD using image processing techniques based on local
 binary patterns and feature extraction. K-NN has been the best classifier for
 our experiments in detecting patients from healthy individuals, by 92.42%
 accuracy, 94.70% sensitivity and 90.15% specificity. The proposed method can
 help automatically diagnose TMD at its initial stages.",
