    abstract "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Associations of young-old age with
 successful aging have contributed to relegating negatively perceived aspects
 of aging to very old age. This has prompted the formation of the social
 imaginary of the fourth age. Re-examinations of the fourth age foreground the
 diversity of aging experiences among the oldest old. In this sense,
 literature is in a privileged position to contribute individual narratives of
 aging to this field. The main aim of this article is to analyze Irish writer
 Jennifer Johnston's later fiction and how particularly two of her later
 fictional works contribute a nuanced re-examination of the fourth age through
 the narrativization of individual aging experiences of the oldest old in the
 contemporary Irish context. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The work of
 sociologists and social theorists on re-examinations of the fourth age
 functions as the framework to analyze the selected fictional texts. RESULTS:
 The analysis of the oldest old characters in Truth or Fiction and Naming the
 Stars shows the contribution of literary texts to rethinking the fourth age
 as a time characterized by the inextricable combination of gains and losses,
 with emphasis on the diversity of the aging experiences of the oldest old and
 on the importance of sociocultural influence on individual aging. DISCUSSION
 AND IMPLICATIONS: Combining longitudinal analyses with case studies, such as
 the ones suggested by these fictional texts, can provide a more accurate
 knowledge of the experience of advanced old age and the fourth age.",
