    abstract "Intensity-modulated proton therapy minimizes the incidental
 irradiation of normal tissues in patients with head and neck cancer relative
 to intensity-modulated photon (x-ray) therapy and has been associated with
 lesser treatment-related toxicity and improved quality of life. A phase
 II/III randomized trial sponsored by the US National Cancer Institute is
 currently underway to compare deintensification treatment strategies with
 intensity-modulated proton therapy vs intensity-modulated photon (x-ray)
 therapy for patients with advanced-stage oropharyngeal tumors. After
 significant input from numerous stakeholders, the phase III portion of the
 randomized trial was redesigned as a noninferiority trial with
 progression-free survival as the primary endpoint. The process by which that
 redesign took place is described here.",
