    abstract "BACKGROUND: A hundred years ago, scientists believed that
 amniotic fluid is a yellowish hypotonic mixture of foetal urine and maternal
 transudate with peculiar odour. Current knowledge shows that it represents a
 dynamic, complex mixture of inorganic and organic compounds. OBJECTIVES:
 Despite modern technological procedures, information is still lacking about
 the composition and properties of amniotic fluid. We focused on dynamics of
 selected physical and chemical properties of the amniotic fluid with the
 increasing gestational week. METHODS: The physicochemical characteristics of
 89 amniotic fluid samples were determined according to the week of pregnancy.
 The determination of pH, specific gravity, glucose and nitrites was performed
 immediately, at room temperature. RESULTS: Our results show a significant
 negative correlation between week of pregnancy and semi-quantitative
 determined parameters of specific gravity (p < 0.001), pH (p < 0.01) and
 glucose (p < 0.001) values. Within the whole group of samples (n = 89), 29 %
 (n = 26) were nitrites positive (N+) and 71 % (n = 63) nitrites negative
 (N-). CONCLUSION: In this study were determined basic parameters of amniotic
 fluid, which could be related to a wide range of pathological states (Tab. 2,
 Fig. 1, Ref. 27).",
