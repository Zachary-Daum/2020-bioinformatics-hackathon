    abstract "Background: ISSau2 has been suggested as a member of the IS150 f
 subgroup in the IS3 family. It encodes a fusion transposase OrfAB produced by
 programmed - 1 translational frameshifting with two overlapping reading
 frames orfA and orfB. To better characterize ISSau2, the binding and cleaving
 activities of the ISSau2 transposase and its transposition frequency were
 studied. Results: The purified ISSau2 transposase OrfAB was a functional
 protein in vitro since it bound specifically to ISSau2 terminal inverted
 repeat sequences (IRs) and cleaved the transposon ends at the artificial
 mini-transposon pUC19-IRL-gfp-IRR. In addition, the transposition frequency
 of ISSau2 in vivo was approximately 1.76 +/- 0.13 x 10(- 3), based on a GFP
 hop-on assay. Furthermore, OrfB cleaved IRs with the similar catalytic
 activity of OrfAB, while OrfA had no catalytic activity. Finally, either OrfA
 or OrfB significantly reduced the transposition of ISSau2 induced by OrfAB.
 Conclusion: We have confirmed that ISSau2 is a member of IS150/IS3 family.
 The ISSau2 transposase OrfAB could bind to and cleave the specific fragments
 containing the terminal inverted repeat sequences and induce the
 transposition, suggesting that ISSau2 is at least partially functional.
 Meanwhile, both OrfA and OrfB inhibited the transposition by ISSau2. Our
 results will help understand biological roles of ISSau2 in its host S. aureus.",
