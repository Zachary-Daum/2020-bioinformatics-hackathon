    abstract "The present article describes an occurrence of testicular
 microlithiasis in a cynomolgus monkey from a routine regulatory toxicology
 study. The monkey was from a negative control group. Microscopically, the
 lesion was characterized by multiple extracellular mineralized calculi within
 seminiferous tubular epithelia of both testes without any tissue reaction or
 abnormal condition such as cryptorchidism, testicular neoplasm, or
 hypogonadism. The present case is remarkable in that there is a paucity of
 reports on spontaneous testicular microlithiasis in nonhuman primates. It is
 hoped that this case report will help to facilitate the differentiation of
 spontaneous changes from induced changes in nonhuman primate toxicology
 studies that are designed to use limited numbers of animals.",
