    abstract "A major goal of education in elementary mathematics is the
 mastery of arithmetic operations. However, research on subtraction is rather
 scarce, probably because subtraction is often implicitly assumed to be
 cognitively similar to addition, its mathematical inverse. To evaluate this
 assumption, we examined the relation between the borrow effect in subtraction
 and the carry effect in addition, and the developmental trajectory of the
 borrow effect in children using a choice reaction paradigm in a longitudinal
 study. In contrast to the carry effect in adults, carry and borrow effects in
 children were found to be categorical rather than continuous. From grades 3
 to 4, children became more proficient in two-digit subtraction in general,
 but not in performing the borrow operation in particular. Thus, we observed
 no specific developmental progress in place-value computation, but a general
 improvement in subtraction procedures. Statement of contribution What is
 already known on this subject? The borrow operation increases difficulty in
 two-digit subtraction in adults. The carry effect in addition, as the inverse
 operation of borrowing, comprises categorical and continuous processing
 characteristics. What does this study add? In contrast to the carry effect in
 adults, the borrow and carry effects are categorical in elementary school
 children. Children generally improve in subtraction performance from grades 3
 to 4 but do not progress in place-value computation in particular.",
