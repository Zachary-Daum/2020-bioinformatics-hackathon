    abstract "Aims After oral administration, naproxen generates several
 side-effects related to stomach malfunction. Undoubtedly, the enteric dosage
 forms with naproxen can be considered as safer. Moreover, since it has been
 evidenced that development and growth of colorectal cancer is related to the
 presence of cyclooxygenase, naproxen is investigated in terms of the tumor
 prevention. The aim of the present work was to formulate and evaluate the
 properties of novel naproxen-loaded macrobeads, made on the basis of low-acyl
 gellan gum and its blends with carrageenans, guar gum, cellulose sulfate, and
 dextran sulfates. Method Seven formulations were prepared by ionotropic
 gelation. The morphology of the dried beads was evaluated by scanning
 electron microscopy. The next step focused on Raman spectroscopy and thermal
 analysis of naproxen, polymers, and the beads. Next, the swelling behavior
 was examined in three acceptor fluids at pH = 1.2; 4.5, and 7.4. The beads
 were evaluated regarding naproxen content and encapsulation efficiency. The
 last stage of the work concerned the drug release studies. Results Addition
 of any other polysaccharide than gellan resulted in flattening of the beads
 upon drying. Differential scanning calorimetry confirmed the crystalline form
 of naproxen. Raman spectra showed that no apparent interactions occurred. In
 the acidic environment, all the beads revealed the tendency to absorb water.
 The beads swelled to the greatest extent at pH = 4.5. Naproxen was released
 from the beads at a varied rate. At pH = 7.4, the most prolonged release was
 observed for the beads containing carrageenans. Conclusions We have proved
 that blending of gellan with various polysaccharides can change the
 pH-dependent properties of the beads loaded with naproxen. We believe that
 the information enclosed in the paper will be of particular importance
 regarding the development and characteristics of novel oral dosage forms
 based on natural polymers.",
