    abstract "Introduction: Cell plasticity is crucial in cloning to allow an
 efficient nuclear reprogramming and healthy offspring. Hence, cells with high
 plasticity, such as multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), may be a
 promising alternative for horse cloning. In this study, we evaluated the use
 of bone marrow-MSCs (BM-MSCs) as nuclear donors in horse cloning, and we
 compared the in vitro and in vivo embryo development with respect to
 fibroblasts. Materials and methods: Zona-free nuclear transfer was performed
 using BM-MSCs (MSC group, n=3432) or adult fibroblasts (AF group, n=4527).
 Embryos produced by artificial insemination (AI) recovered by uterine
 flushing and transferred to recipient mares were used as controls (AI group).
 Results: Blastocyst development was higher in the MSC group than in the AF
 group (18.1% vs 10.9%, respectively; p<0.05). However, pregnancy rates and
 delivery rates were similar in both cloning groups, although they were lower
 than in the AI group (pregnancy rates: 17.7% [41/232] for MSC, 12.5% [37/297]
 for AF and 80.7% [71/88] for AI; delivery rates: 56.8% [21/37], 41.5% [17/41]
 and 90.1% [64/71], respectively). Remarkably, the gestation length of the AF
 group was significantly longer than the control (361.7+/-10.9 vs 333.9+/-8.7
 days), in contrast to the MSC group (340.6+/-8.89 days). Of the total
 deliveries, 95.2% (20/21) of the MSC-foals were viable, compared to 52.9%
 (9/17) of the AF-foals (p<0.05). In addition, the AF-foals had more
 physiological abnormalities at birth than the MSC-foals; 90.5% (19/21) of the
 MSC-delivered foals were completely normal and healthy, compared to 35.3%
 (6/17) in the AF group. The abnormalities included flexural or angular limb
 deformities, umbilical cord enlargement, placental alterations and signs of
 syndrome of neonatal maladjustment, which were treated in most cases.
 Conclusion: In summary, we obtained 29 viable cloned foals and found that
 MSCs are suitable donor cells in horse cloning. Even more, these cells could
 be more efficiently reprogrammed compared to fibroblasts.",
