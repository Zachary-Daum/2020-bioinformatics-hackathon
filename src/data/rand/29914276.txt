    abstract "The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcome
 of simple trapeziectomy by a single surgeon and to compare this with
 pre-operative function. Two hundred and five patients completed the shortened
 disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire (QuickDASH) and the
 EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) scores at a mean of 8.2 (range
 3.5-17) years after simple trapeziectomy. There were no pre-operative scores
 available, so case controls were selected from our prospective database to
 compare pre- and post-operative patient-reported outcome measures. The mean
 QuickDASH score of the post-operative matched group was 37 (SD 17.0) and the
 mean EQ-5D was 0.56 (SD 0.31). The mean QuickDASH score of the pre-operative
 group was 54 (SD 17.0). The mean difference in QuickDASH between the pre- and
 post-operative groups was 17 (95% CI: 8 to 26, p = 0.0003). This study
 demonstrated a significant and sustained improvement in patient-reported
 function after simple trapeziectomy. It supports that simple trapeziectomy is
 a simple, safe and effective treatment for advanced trapeziometacarpal joint
 arthritis. Level of evidence: IV.",
