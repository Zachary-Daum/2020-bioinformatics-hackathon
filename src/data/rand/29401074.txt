    abstract "BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal conditions are among the most common
 and costly conditions suffered by Americans. In 2011, there was an estimated
 $213 billion in annual cost of direct treatment for and lost wages due to
 musculoskeletal disease in the United States. Data on economic burden,
 however, comes mostly from the adult population, with significantly less
 information regarding the burden of these conditions in young patients
 available. The purpose of this report is to provide data on the economic
 burden of musculoskeletal diseases in children and adolescents in the United
 States. METHODS: Eleven diagnosis categories were identified, with health
 care visits and hospitalization data derived from ICD-9-CM codes for each of
 the conditions searched. The largest database utilized was the Healthcare
 Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). Total
 visits came from the KID, HCUP NEDS (emergency department), NCHS NHAMCS OP
 (outpatient), and NCHS NAMCS (physician office) databases. The National
 Health Interview Survey (NHIS) child sample was additionally searched to
 obtain patient/parent-reported data. RESULTS: In 2012, more than 19 million
 children and adolescents received treatment in medical centers, physicians'
 offices, and hospitals for a musculoskeletal-related condition. The most
 common reason for treatment (68%) was traumatic injury, followed by a pain
 syndrome (13%) and deformity (9%). Total hospital charges in 2012 for
 children and adolescents with a primary musculoskeletal-related diagnosis
 totaled $7.6 billion. Trauma (43%) and deformity (38%) were the major
 contributors to total hospital charges. CONCLUSIONS: Although we found that
 hospital-related charges for musculoskeletal diseases for children and
 adolescents in 2012 totaled $7.6 billion, this number underestimates the
 total cost for all pediatric musculoskeletal conditions. Musculoskeletal
 conditions accounted for 5.4% of hospital charges in the pediatric
 population. However, only 1.4% of pediatric research funding is designated to
 musculoskeletal research. Going forward, the data in this report may be used
 to further research and to stimulate development of better methods with which
 to measure the direct and indirect costs of musculoskeletal conditions in
 children. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-economic and decision analysis.",
