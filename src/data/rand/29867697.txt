    abstract "Background: In view of a shortage of health care costs, monetary
 aspects of psychotherapy become increasingly relevant. The present study
 examined the pre-post reduction of impairment and direct health care costs
 depending on therapy termination (regularly terminated, dropout with an
 unproblematic reason, and dropout with a quality-relevant reason) and the
 association of symptom and cost reduction. Methods: In a naturalistic
 longitudinal study, we examined a disorder heterogeneous sample of N = 584
 outpatients who were either treated with cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic,
 or psychoanalytic therapy. Depression, anxiety, stress, and somatization were
 assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Annual amounts of
 inpatient costs, outpatient costs, medication costs, days of hospitalization,
 work disability days, utilization of psychotherapy, and utilization of
 pharmacotherapy 1 year before therapy and 1 year after therapy were provided
 by health care insurances. Symptom and cost reduction were analyzed using
 t-tests. Associations between symptom and cost reduction were examined using
 partial correlations and hierarchical linear models. Results: Patients who
 terminated therapy regularly showed the largest symptom reduction (d =
 0.981-1.22). Patients who dropped out due to an unproblematic reason and
 patients who terminated early due to a quality-relevant reason showed
 significant but small effects of symptom reductions (e.g., depression: d =
 0.429 vs. d = 0.366). For patients with a regular end and those dropping out
 due to a quality-relevant reason, we observed a significant reduction of work
 disability (diff in % of pre-test value = 56.3 vs. 42.9%) and hospitalization
 days (52.8 vs. 35.0%). Annual inpatient costs decreased in the group with a
 regular therapy end (31.5%). Furthermore, reduction of symptoms on the one
 side and reduction of work disability days and psychotherapy utilization on
 the other side were significant correlated (r = 0.091-0.135). Conclusion:
 Health care costs and symptoms were reduced in each of the three groups. The
 average symptom and cost reduction of patients with a quality-relevant
 dropout suggested that not each dropout might be seen as therapy failure.",
