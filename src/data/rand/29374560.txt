    abstract "Development of tolerance protocols requires assays or biomarkers
 that distinguish tolerant recipients from non-tolerant ones to be
 established. In addition, a thorough understanding of the plausible
 mechanisms associated with clinical transplant tolerance is necessary to take
 the field forward. Unlike the majority of molecular signature analyses
 utilized by others, the emphasis of this article is on the cellular and
 functional biomarkers of induced transplant tolerance. Immunity to an organ
 transplant is very complex, comprised of two broad categories - innate and
 acquired or adaptive immune responses. Innate immunity can be avoided by
 eliminating or preventing ischemic injuries to the donor organ and tolerance
 at the level of adaptive immunity can be induced by infusions of a number of
 cellular products. Since adaptive immune response consists of inflammatory
 hypersensitivity, cellular (cytotoxic and helper) and humoral aspects, all
 these need to be measured, and the recipients who demonstrate donor-specific
 unresponsiveness in all can be considered tolerant or candidates for
 immunosuppression minimization and/or withdrawal. The mechanisms by which
 these agents bring about transplant tolerance include regulation, anergy,
 exhaustion, senescence and deletion of the recipient immune cells. Another
 proven mechanism of tolerance is full or mixed donor chimerism. However, it
 should be cautioned that non-deletional tolerance can be reversed.",
