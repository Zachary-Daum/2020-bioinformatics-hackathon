    abstract "BACKGROUND: Limited or no literature exists identifying factors
 associated with functional nerve recovery in patients undergoing resection of
 sixth cranial nerve (CN VI) schwannomas. METHODS: A systematic review of
 literature was performed on CN VI schwannomas that were treated surgically.
 Synthesizing the findings pooled from the literature, we investigated
 associations of patient demographics and clinical characteristics with
 postsurgical CN VI functional recovery in multivariable regression models. In
 addition, we present the findings of an adolescent woman surgically managed
 for intracavernous CN VI schwannoma. Complete encasement of the cavernous
 segment of the internal carotid artery is unique to our case. RESULTS: We
 synthesized data of 32 patients from 29 studies, and our index case. Overall,
 the mean age of the patients was 44.0 +/- 16.5 years, and approximately 52%
 (n = 17) were female. Most tumors were left-sided (n = 18; 54.5%), with an
 average size of 3.46 +/- 1.71 cm. The most common location was cisternal (n =
 11; 33%), followed by cavernous sinus (CS) proper (n = 9; 27%),
 cisterocavernous (n = 8; 24%), orbital (n = 4; 12%) and caverno-orbital (n =
 1; 3%). CN VI recovery was reported in less than half the cohort (n = 14;
 45%). Tumor extension in the CS was significantly associated with lesser
 likelihood (odds ratio [OR], 0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.98; P
 = 0.048) of postsurgical CN VI recovery. Although female gender (OR, 0.86;
 95% CI, 0.07-10.09; P = 0.906), large tumor size (>2.5 cm) (OR, 0.45; 95% CI,
 0.07-2.89; P = 0.397), and solid consistency (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.03-4.19; P
 = 0.421) were associated with lesser odds for recovery, these were not
 statistically significant. Likewise, although gross total resection (OR,
 6.28; 95% CI, 0.33-118.25; P = 0.220) was associated with higher odds of
 nerve recovery, the estimates were statistically insignificant. CONCLUSIONS:
 CS involvement is associated with lesser odds for functional nerve recovery
 in patients undergoing surgical resection for CN VI schwannoma.",
