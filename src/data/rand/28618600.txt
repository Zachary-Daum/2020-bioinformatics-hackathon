    abstract "In this work, we provide a theoretical relationship between the
 spatial-dependent diffusion coefficient derived in the Fick-Jacobs (FJ)
 approximation and the macroscopic diffusion coefficient of a membrane that
 depends on the porosity, tortuosity, and the constriction factors. Based on
 simple mass conservation arguments under equilibrium as well as in
 nonequilibrium conditions, we generalize previous expressions for the
 effective diffusion coefficient of an irregular pore, originally obtained by
 Festa and d'Agliano for horizontal and periodic pores, and then extended by
 Bradley for tortuous periodic pores, to the case of pores with arbitrary
 geometry. Through a formal definition of the constrictivity factor in terms
 of the geometry of the pore, our results provide very clear physical
 interpretation of experimental measurements since they link the local
 properties of the flow with macroscopic quantities of experimental relevance
 in the design and optimization of porous materials. The macroscopic diffusion
 coefficient as well as the spatiotemporal evolution of the concentration
 profiles inside a pore have been recently measured by using pulse field
 gradient NMR techniques. The advantage of using the FJ approach is that the
 spatiotemporal concentration profile inside a pore of irregular geometry is
 directly related to the pore's shape and, therefore, that the macroscopic
 diffusion coefficient can be obtained by comparing the spatiotemporal
 concentration profiles from such experiments with those of the theoretical
 model. Hence, the present study is relevant for the understanding of the
 transport properties of porous materials where the shape and arrangement of
 pores can be controlled at will.",
