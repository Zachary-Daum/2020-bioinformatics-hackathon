    abstract "We previously reported that serotonergic transmission is
 involved in the antidepressant effects of metabotropic glutamate 2/3
 (mGlu2/3) receptor antagonists. However, the detailed underlying mechanisms
 had not yet been explored. In the present study, we investigated the role of
 the 5-HT1A receptor and its signaling cascade in the medial prefrontal cortex
 (mPFC) in the antidepressant effects of LY341495, an mGlu2/3 receptor
 antagonist. LY341495 significantly reduced the immobility time in the forced
 swimming test which sustained for 24 h after administration. The
 antidepressant effect of LY341495 was attenuated by either intraperitoneal or
 intra-mPFC injection of WAY100635, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. Among the
 signaling cascades mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor, the role of
 phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, which has a critical role in
 neuroplasticity, was investigated. The sustained antidepressant effect of
 LY341495 was blocked by intra-mPFC injection of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor.
 LY341495 increased the phosphorylation of Akt in the mPFC, which was blocked
 by both intra-mPFC injection of WAY100635 and LY294002. Thus, LY341495
 activates PI3K/Akt signaling, presumably via stimulation of the 5-HT1A
 receptor in the mPFC, to exert its sustained antidepressant effect.
 Involvement of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) signaling
 was also demonstrated, as the sustained antidepressant effects of LY341495
 was attenuated by intra-mPFC injection of rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor.
 Finally, the sustained antidepressant effect of LY341495 was also attenuated
 by silencing of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) neurons. These results suggest
 that stimulation of the 5-HT1A receptor in the mPFC and its signaling
 cascade, PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling mediate the sustained antidepressant
 effect of LY341495, and that activation of the DRN neurons is also involved
 in these processes.",
