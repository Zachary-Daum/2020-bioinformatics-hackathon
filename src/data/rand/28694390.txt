    abstract "BACKGROUND: Zika virus, a previously neglected mosquito-borne
 virus, is prompting worldwide concern because of its connection with
 congenital defects, Guillain-Barre syndrome, meningoencephalitis and myelitis
 in infected individuals. However, no specific antiviral therapy is available
 at present. In this study, we investigated the in vitro susceptibility of
 geographically and temporally distinct Zika viruses against the RNA
 polymerase inhibitors, favipiravir (T-705) and ribavirin. METHODS: The in
 vitro activity of each drug and a 1:1 mixture combination was assessed
 against five geographically and temporally distinct Zika strains by plaque
 reduction assay (PRA), the gold standard phenotypic method. RESULTS: We
 showed that both drugs exhibit in vitro inhibitory activity against five
 different Zika strains isolated in different years and continents, with mean
 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 35 +/-14 and 35 +/-20 microM,
 respectively, by PRA. We did not observe a synergistic effect when both drugs
 were combined at the equimolar concentration (IC50 =33 +/-11 microM).
 CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that T-705 has the potential to be used
 in patients with complicated diseases and/or those individuals presenting
 with significant comorbidities.",
