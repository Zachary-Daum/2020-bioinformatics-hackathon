    abstract "Because phenotypic plasticity can operate both within and
 between generations, phenotypic outcomes are often shaped by a complex
 history of environmental signals. For example, parental and embryonic
 experiences with predation risk can both independently and interactively
 influence prey offspring traits early in their life. Parental and embryonic
 risk experiences can also independently shape offspring phenotypes throughout
 an offspring's ontogeny, but the persistence of their interactive effects
 throughout offspring ontogeny is unknown. We examined the effects of parental
 and embryonic experiences with predation risk on the response of 1-year-old
 prey (the carnivorous snail, Nucella lapillus) offspring to current predation
 risk. We found that parental and embryonic risk experiences had largely
 independent effects on offspring performance and that these effects were
 context dependent. Parental experience with risk had strong impacts on
 multiple offspring traits in the presence of current risk that generally
 improved offspring performance under risk, but embryonic risk experience had
 relatively weaker effects and only operated in the absence of current risk to
 reduce offspring growth. These results illustrate that past environmental
 experiences can dynamically shape organism phenotypes across ontogeny and
 that attention to these effects is key to a better understanding of
 predator/prey dynamics in natural systems.",
