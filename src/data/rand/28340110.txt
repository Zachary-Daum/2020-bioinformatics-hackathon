    abstract "Aims: The aim of this study is to characterize the
 arrhythmogenic substrate for peri-mitral atrial flutter (PMAFL), thereby
 determining a personalized ablation strategy to treat PMAFL. Methods and
 results: Thirty-six consecutive PMAFL patients (mean age: 63.8 +/- 11.3, 23
 males) underwent detailed three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping in left
 atrium (LA). The LA was divided into septal-anterior wall (SAW), posterior
 inferior wall (PIW), and mitral isthmus (MI) region, respectively. Ablation
 strategy was determined based on the endocardial bipolar voltage map. Based
 on electrophysiological substrates, 10, 17, and 9 cases were classified into
 iatrogenic, spontaneous, and no-substrate PMAFL, respectively. The mean
 voltage in SAW was significantly lower in spontaneous PMAFL (iatrogenic: 1.07
 +/- 0.66 mV; spontaneous: 0.65 +/- 0.44 mV; no-substrate: 1.60 +/- 0.53 mV, P
 <0.001), while iatrogenic PMAFL patients had the lowest voltage in MI (0.51
 +/- 0.23 mV vs. 1.55 +/- 0.78 mV, 1.61 +/- 0.56 mV, P <0.001). No low-voltage
 or slow conduction zone was found in the no-substrate PMAFL group. Fifteen
 spontaneous PMAFLs were successfully terminated by modified septal-anterior
 (9/10) or conventional anterior ablation line (6/7). Eight iatrogenic PMAFLs
 (8/10) were terminated by reinforcing the previous ablation areas.
 Cardioversion without PMAFL ablation was done in no-substrate PMAFL patients.
 After a median follow-up of 12 (7-39) months, two spontaneous PMAFL patients
 received redo procedures for recurrence due to ""gap"" conduction.
 Conclusions: The ablation strategy for PMAFL patients should be based on the
 arrhythmogenic substrate, but not the indiscriminate MI ablation.
 No-substrate PMAFLs during AF ablation could be monitored after cardioversion
 and might not need further ablation.",
