    abstract "AIM: To investigate the root canal morphology of hypomineralised
 second primary molars(HSPM) using micro-CT(muCT) compared with
 non-hypomineralised second primary molars (non-HSPM). METHODOLOGY: Ten HSPM
 and 10 non-HSPM were divided into Group 1(maxillary HSPM), Group 2
 (mandibular HSPM), Group 3(maxillary non-HSPM), and Group 4 (mandibular
 non-HSPM). All teeth were scanned using muCT to assess the following
 parameters: (i) root canal configuration, (ii) pulp volumes, and (iii) the
 influence of the root canal system landmarks on access cavity outline forms
 and canal curvature. Two-way ANOVA was employed for descriptive analysis (P <
 0.05). RESULTS: At the furcation level, there was minimal variation in the
 number of canals. In the mesiobuccal root, Group 1 showed higher frequency of
 multiple canals in the middle (85.7%) and apical (85.7%) thirds compared with
 Group 3. In the mesial root, Group 4 demonstrated multiple canals at the
 furcation (60%) compared with Group 2(33.3%). In the distal root, Group 2
 demonstrated a higher percentage of multiple canals at the apical level
 (100%) compared with Group 4. The mean pulp volumes of Group 2 and Group 4
 were 54.1 mm(3) (16.7) and 30 mm(3) (5.12), respectively, which was
 statistically significant (P < 0.05). The canal curvature values did not
 differ significantly between HSPM and non-HSPM groups. CONCLUSIONS: HSPM
 exhibited greater variations in their root canal configuration when compared
 to non-HSPM.",
