    abstract "The objective of this systematic review was to perform a
 comprehensive overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses pertaining to
 peri-implantitis in humans, including the prevalence and incidence, the
 diagnostic findings, microbial findings, effects of systemic diseases, and
 treatment of peri-implantitis. Electronic databases were searched for
 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of peri-implantitis. In view of the
 limitations of the included systematic reviews, the outcome of this overview
 suggested that (1) occurrence of peri-implantitis was higher in patients with
 periodontitis, in patients who smoke, and after 5 years of implant function;
 (2) the microbial profile of peri-implantitis was different from
 periodontitis; (3) risk for peri-implantitis was higher in patients with
 uncontrolled diabetes and cardiovascular disease; (4) there was no strong
 evidence to suggest the most effective treatment intervention for
 peri-implantitis, although most peri-implantitis treatments can produce
 successful outcomes; and (5) postimplant maintenance may be crucial in
 patients with a high risk of peri-implantitis.",
