    abstract "Macular degeneration (MD) affects central vision and represents
 the leading cause of visual diseases in elderly population worldwide. As a
 consequence of central vision loss, MD patients develop a preferred retinal
 locus (PRL), an eccentric fixation point that replaces the fovea. Here, our
 aim was to determine whether and to what extent spontaneous plasticity takes
 place in the cortical regions formerly responding to central vision and
 whether a visual training based on perceptual learning (PL) can boost this
 plasticity within the PRL area. Spontaneous and PL-induced cortical
 plasticity were characterized by using lateral masking, a contrast
 sensitivity modulation induced by collinear flankers. This configuration is
 known to be sensitive to neural plasticity and underlies several
 rehabilitation trainings. Results in a group of 4 MD patients showed that
 collinear facilitation was similar to what observed in age- and
 eccentricity-matched controls. However, MD patients exhibited significantly
 reduced collinear inhibition, a sign of neural plasticity, consistent with
 the hypothesis of partial cortical reorganization. Three AMD patients from
 the same group showed a further reduction of inhibition after training, but
 not controls. This result suggests that PL might further boost neural
 plasticity, opening promising perspectives for the development of
 rehabilitation protocols for MD patients.",
