    abstract "Soil wettability (quantified in terms of contact angle, CA) is
 crucial for physical, chemical, and biological soil functioning. As the CA is
 determined by components present within the outmost nanometer of particles,
 this study applied X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a maximum
 analysis depth of 10 nm to test the relationship between CA and surface
 elemental composition, using soil samples from a chronosequence where CA
 increased from 0 degrees  (0 yrs) to about 98 degrees  (120 yrs).
 Concurrently, as seen by XPS, C and N content increased and the content of O
 and the mineral-derived cations (Si, Al, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe) decreased. The C
 content was positively correlated with CA and least squares fitting indicated
 increasing amounts of non-polar C species with soil age. The contents of O
 and the mineral-derived cations were negatively correlated with CA,
 suggesting an increasing organic coating of the minerals that progressively
 masked the underlying mineral phase. The atomic O/C ratio was found to show a
 close negative relationship with CA, which applied as well to further sample
 sets of different texture and origin. This suggests the surface O/C ratio to
 be a general parameter linking surface wettability and surface elemental
 composition.",
