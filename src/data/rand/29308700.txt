    abstract "Few studies have compared different systems in classifying Adult
 Attachment Interview (AAI) transcripts. In this study, the AAI was
 administered to 90 Italian parents (45 couples), and the AAI transcripts were
 independently classified according to Main, Goldwyn, and Hesse's (Berkeley)
 and Crittenden's (Dynamic-Maturational Model [DMM]) criteria. The two
 classification systems were not significantly associated, with some limited
 convergent results only when the interviews resulted in organized (Berkeley)
 and normative (DMM) attachment classifications. Otherwise, the Berkeley
 system identified more secure individuals than the DMM system, and many texts
 judged secure on the Berkeley system were identified as insecure on the DMM
 system. Since the Berkeley and the DMM systems rest on remarkably different
 conceptualizations of the nature and functioning of the attachment behavioral
 system (e.g. fear is conceived as organizing in the DMM and as potentially
 disorganizing in the Berkeley), the attachment classifications resulting from
 their applications should not be considered measurements of the same
 phenomena.",
