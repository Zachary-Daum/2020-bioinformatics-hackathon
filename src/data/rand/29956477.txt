    abstract "The Lung session of the 2017 14th Banff Foundation for Allograft
 Pathology Conference, Barcelona focused on the multiple aspects of
 antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in lung transplantation. Multidimensional
 approaches for AMR diagnosis, including classification, histological and
 immunohistochemical analysis, and donor- specific antibody (DSA)
 characterization with their current strengths and limitations were reviewed
 in view of recent research. The group also discussed the role of tissue gene
 expression analysis in the context of unmet needs in lung transplantation.
 The current best practice for monitoring of AMR and the therapeutic approach
 are summarized and highlighted in this report. The working group reached
 consensus of the major gaps in current knowledge and focused on the
 unanswered questions regarding pulmonary AMR. An important outcome of the
 meeting was agreement on the need for future collaborative research projects
 to address these gaps in the field of lung transplantation.",
