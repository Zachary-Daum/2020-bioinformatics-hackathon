    abstract "KEY MESSAGE: Expression analyses revealed that floral transition
 of Rosa odorata var. gigantea is mainly regulated by VRN1, COLs, DELLA and
 KSN, with contributions by the effects of phytohormone and starch metabolism.
 Seasonal plants utilize changing environmental and developmental cues to
 control the transition from vegetative growth to flowering at the correct
 time of year. This study investigated global gene expression profiles at
 different developmental stages of Rosa odorata var. gigantea by
 RNA-sequencing, combined with phenotypic characterization and physiological
 changes. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed
 genes (DEGs) between four different developmental stages (vegetative
 meristem, pre-floral meristem, floral meristem and secondary axillary buds)
 indicated that DNA methylation and the light reaction played a large role in
 inducing the rose floral transition. The expression of SUF and FLC, which are
 known to play a role in delaying flowering until vernalization, was
 down-regulated from the vegetative to the pre-floral meristem stage. In
 contrast, the expression of VRN1, which promotes flowering by repressing FLC
 expression, increased. The expression of DELLA proteins, which function as
 central nodes in hormone signaling pathways, and probably involve
 interactions between GA, auxin, and ABA to promote the floral transition, was
 well correlated with the expression of floral integrators, such as AGL24,
 COL4. We also identified DEGs associated with starch metabolism correlated
 with SOC1, AGL15, SPL3, AGL24, respectively. Taken together, our results
 suggest that vernalization and photoperiod are prominent cues to induce the
 rose floral transition, and that DELLA proteins also act as key regulators.
 The results summarized in the study on the floral transition of the seasonal
 rose lay a foundation for further functional demonstration, and have profound
 economic and ornamental values.",
