    abstract "AIMS: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major chronic
 vascular complication of T2DM and leading cause of end-stage renal disease.
 Inflammation is one of the proposed pathway which explains microvascular
 complications in T2DM but exact mechanism is still unclear. Omentin-1 is an
 anti-in fl ammatory adipokine which promotes insulin signaling. IL-6 is a
 multifunctional cytokine having role in immune and inflammatory responses.
 The present study was conducted to elucidate the role of omentin-1 and IL-6
 in the pathogenesis of DN and its association with insulin resistance. We
 aimed to assess and compare the serum levels of omentin-1 and IL-6 in T2DM
 patients with and without DN. MATERIALS & METHODS: Our study comprised of 2
 groups of 41 each. Group A (controls) included T2DM without nephropathy
 patients and group B (cases) included T2DM nephropathy patients. Parameters
 studied were serum omentin-1, insulin, IL-6, fasting blood glucose, urea,
 creatinine, lipid profile, HOMA-IR, eGFR and BMI. RESULTS & CONCLUSION:
 Omentin-1 (p=0.03) was significantly decreased; concomitantly, significant
 increase in levels of insulin (p=0.004), IL-6 (p=0.023) and HOMA-IR
 (p=0.0004) were found in cases compared to controls. Bivariate analysis
 showed eGFR correlating positively with omentin-1 and negatively with insulin
 in the study population. Our study results, based on serum omentin-1 and IL-6
 data suggest important role played by inflammatory mechanism and insulin
 resistance in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes
 mellitus patients.",
