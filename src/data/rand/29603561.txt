    abstract "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are commonly prepared by
 exfoliating bulk layered van der Waals crystals. The creation of synthetic 2D
 materials from bottom-up methods is an important challenge as their
 structural flexibility will enable chemists to tune the materials properties.
 A 2D material was assembled using C60 as a polymerizable monomer. The C60
 building blocks are first assembled into a layered solid using a molecular
 cluster as structure director. The resulting hierarchical crystal is used as
 a template to polymerize its C60 monolayers, which can be exfoliated down to
 2D crystalline nanosheets. Derived from the parent template, the 2D structure
 is composed of a layer of inorganic cluster, sandwiched between two
 monolayers of polymerized C60 . The nanosheets can be transferred onto solid
 substrates and depolymerized by heating. Electronic absorption spectroscopy
 reveals an optical gap of 0.25 eV, narrower than that of the bulk parent
 crystalline solid.",
