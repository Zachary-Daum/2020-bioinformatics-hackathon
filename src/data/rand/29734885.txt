    abstract "BACKGROUND: Dignified care is one of the main objectives of
 holistic care. Furthermore, paying attention to dignity as one of the
 fundamental rights of patients is extremely important. However, in many
 cases, the dignity of hospitalized patients is not considered. Dignity is an
 abstract concept, and comprehensive studies of the dignity of Iranian
 patients hospitalized in general hospital settings are limited. OBJECTIVE:
 The aim of this study was to explore the concept of dignity from the
 perspective of patients hospitalized in general hospital settings in Iran.
 RESEARCH DESIGN: This study takes a qualitative approach. Data were gathered
 using individual, semi-structured interviews. Qualitative content analysis
 was the method used to analyse and interpret the data. The criteria suggested
 by Guba and Lincoln were used ensure the trustworthiness of the study.
 Participants and research context: A total of 14 hospitalized patients in
 general hospital settings in Shiraz participated in this study. Ethical
 considerations: The Research Ethics Committee of the Shiraz University of
 Medical Sciences approved the protocol of the study and the ethical
 principles were followed throughout. FINDINGS: The findings of this study
 revealed four main themes - 'respectful atmosphere', 'patient privacy', 
'preservation of authority' and 'receiving attention' - and 10 categories.
 DISCUSSION: Patients need to be hospitalized in a respectable environment in
 which their privacy is preserved and paid attention, providing them with
 sufficient authority in terms of medical decisions and their life-related
 issues. The dignity of hospitalized patients will be preserved under these
 conditions. CONCLUSION: Patients hospitalized in general hospital settings
 need to retain their dignity. This can contribute to the optimal therapeutic
 outcomes for them. Therefore, it is suggested that a cultural, professional
 and institutional background, in which all components of the patient's
 dignity are protected and emphasized, should be provided.",
