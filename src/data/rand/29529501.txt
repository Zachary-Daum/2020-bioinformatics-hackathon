    abstract "HIV infection still has a serious health and socio-economical
 impact and is one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality all over
 the world. HIV infection and the AIDS pandemic are still matters of great
 concern, especially in less developed countries where the access to highly
 active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is limited. Patient compliance is
 another serious drawback. Nowadays, HAART is the treatment of choice although
 it is not the panacea. Despite the fact that it suppresses viral replication
 at undetectable viral loads and prevents progression of HIV infection into
 AIDS HAART has several pitfalls, namely, long-term side-effects, drug
 resistance development, emergence of drug-resistant viruses, low compliance
 and the intolerance of some patients to these drugs. Moreover, another
 serious health concern is the event of co-infection with more than one
 pathogen at the same time (e.g. HIV and HCV, HBV, herpes viruses, etc).
 Currently, the multi-target drug approach has become an exciting strategy to
 address complex diseases and overcome drug resistance development. Such
 multifunctional molecules combine in their structure pharmacophores that may
 simultaneously interfere with multiple targets and their use may eventually
 be more safe and efficacious than that involving a mixture of separate
 molecules because of avoidance or delay of drug resistance, lower incidence
 of unwanted drug-drug interactions and improved compliance. In this review we
 focus on multifunctional molecules with dual activity against different
 targets of the HIV life cycle or able to block replication, not only of HIV
 but also of other viruses that are often co-pathogens of HIV. The different
 approaches are documented by selected examples.",
