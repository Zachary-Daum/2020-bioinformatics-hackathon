    abstract "BACKGROUND: Functional limitations are a major cause for needing
 care and institutionalization among older adults. Exposure to air pollution
 has been suggested to be associated with increased functional limitations in
 older people. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the association between
 air pollution and physical functioning in Dutch older adults. METHODS: We
 analyzed data on performance-based (walking speed, ability to rise from a
 chair, putting on and taking off a cardigan, balance test) and self-reported
 physical functioning for 1,762 participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study
 Amsterdam, who participated in measurement cycles performed in 2005/2006,
 2008/2009, and 2011/2012. Annual average outdoor air pollution concentrations
 [nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter with
 diameters </=2.5mum (PM2.5), </=10mum (PM10), and 2.5-10mum (PMcoarse), and
 PM2.5 absorbance] at the home address at the start of the first measurement
 cycle were estimated using land-use regression models. Analyses were
 performed using mixed models with random participant intercepts adjusting for
 potential confounders. RESULTS: Exposure to most air pollutants was
 associated with reduced performance-based physical functioning; for example,
 an interquartile range increase in NO2 exposure was associated with a 0.22
 (95% confidence interval: 0.03, 0.42) lower performance test score in fully
 adjusted models, equivalent to the difference in performance score between
 participants who differed by 9 mo in age. Exposure to air pollution was
 generally not statistically significantly associated with self-reported
 functional limitations, and not associated with a faster decline in
 performance-based physical functioning over the study period. CONCLUSION:
 This study suggests that exposure to air pollution may adversely affect
 physical performance of older adults in the Netherlands.
