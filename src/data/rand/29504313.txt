    abstract "Phenolics, as the main bioactive compounds in tea, have been
 suggested to have potential in the prevention of various human diseases.
 However, little is known about phenolics and their bioactivity in Zhangping
 Narcissue tea cake which is considered the most special kind of oolong tea.
 To unveil its bioactivity, three phenolic-enriched extracts were obtained
 from Zhangping Narcissue tea cake using ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water.
 Their main chemical compositions and in vitro bioactivity were analyzed by
 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-performance liquid
 chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The ethyl acetate fraction (ZEF)
 consisted of higher content of phenolics, flavonoids, procyanidins, and
 catechin monomers (including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin
 gallate (ECG), and gallocatechin gallate (GCG)) than n-butanol fraction (ZBF)
 and water fraction (ZWF). ZEF exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity in
 vitro due to its abundant bioactive compounds. This was validated by Pearson
 correlation and hierarchical clustering analyses. ZEF also showed a
 remarkable inhibition on the growth, migration, and invasion of 4T1 murine
 breast cancer cells.",
