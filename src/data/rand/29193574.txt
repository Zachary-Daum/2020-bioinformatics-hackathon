    abstract "While Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is uncommon in western
 countries, it is endemic in Southeast Asia and Southern China. Previous study
 of norcantharidin (NCTD), isolated from blister beetles, has proved its
 anticancer effect on various tumors. However, the effect of NCTD in NPC has
 never been studied. The purpose of this study is to inspect the suppression
 activity of NCTD on NPC, along with the underlying mechanism. NPC cell line
 NPC-BM was treated with NCTD. NCTD remarkably inhibited proliferation and
 induce apoptosis in NPC-BM cell. Activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 was observed
 through western blotting. The expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL was
 significantly reduced, but expression of proapoptotic protein Bak was
 increased after treatment of NCTD. The cytotoxic effect of NCTD on NPC-BM
 cell is mainly due to apoptosis, mediated by caspase and mitochondrial
 pathway. These results suggested that NCTD could be a potential anticancer
 agent for NPC.",
