    abstract "The objective of the study was to describe self-report and
 objectively measured sleep characteristics of adult treatment-seeking
 cannabis users. Study participants (n = 87) were adults who were screened for
 a 12-week outpatient cannabis treatment research program in Baltimore, MD.
 Participants completed objective and self-report measures of sleep quality.
 Data were analyzed for the sample overall and after stratifying by sex (54
 men, 33 women). Participants were primarily urban, socioeconomically
 disadvantaged African Americans. Participants were frequent, heavy cannabis
 users; among a subset of participants assessed, 76.7% used cannabis on the
 day/night of the assessment. Participants had low rates of other substance
 abuse and of psychiatric comorbidities. Polysomnography indicated 19.5% of
 participants received the recommended 7 to 9 hr of sleep, with women
 averaging more sleep than men. One third (31.0%) had sleep latencies >30 min,
 one half spent >30 min awake after sleep onset, and more than one half of the
 sample (55.2%) had sleep efficiency scores of <85%. Most participants met
 criteria for subthreshold (36.8%) or clinical insomnia (25.3%) on the
 Insomnia Severity Index, 77.0% had scores of >5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep
 Quality Index. Most had average scores on the Dysfunctional Beliefs and
 Attitudes About Sleep (DBAS) questionnaire (M = 51.1, SD = 18.8) that were
 higher than average among clinical insomnia patients. Women had higher DBAS
 scores than men. Most participants exhibited characteristics of disordered
 sleep, and sex differences were observed on polysomnography and self-report
 measures. Findings extend prior research concerning the association between
 cannabis use and disordered sleep. Data presented in this article come from
