    abstract "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to measure flap
 thicknesses of anterolateral thigh (ALT) and medial sural artery perforator
 (MSAP) flaps in healthy subjects by Doppler ultrasonography and compare the
 results in relation to sex and body mass index (BMI). METHOD: The perforators
 of ALT and MSAP flaps were marked on 30 healthy subjects. The thickness of
 skin and subcutaneous tissue was measured in millimeters at the site of the
 perforator using Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD age of the
 participants was 36.4 +/- 10.5, the mean +/- SD BMI was 25.2 +/- 3.9
 (19.4-32.5). The mean +/- SD flap thickness was 11.55 +/- 4.38 mm for ALT and
 8.31 +/- 3.6 mm mm for MSAP (P < 0.01). Anterolateral thigh flap was
 significantly thicker than MSAP in both males (9.02 vs 6.11 mm) and females
 (14.07 vs 10.52 mm) (P < 0.05). The thickness of both MSAP and ALT flap had a
 positive correlation with BMI. The relationship was stronger for ALT in males
 (r = 0.66 for ALT, r = 0.59 for MSAP) and for MSAP in females (r = 0.70 for
 ALT, r = 0.83 for MSAP). DISCUSSION: This study confirms that MSAP flap is
 thinner than ALT and the results correlate with BMI. Therefore, MSAP flap can
 be considered a good alternative to ALT, to avoid bulk, in reconstruction of
 shallower soft tissue defects.",
