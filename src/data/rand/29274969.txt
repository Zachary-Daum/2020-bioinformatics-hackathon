    abstract "Estradiol inhibits milk production in dairy cows. The present
 study evaluated the effect of 17beta-estradiol (E2) injections on prolactin
 (PRL) secretion and the mammary gland response to this hormone. Eight
 mid-lactation cows were used in a crossover design. During each experimental
 period, the cows were injected daily with either E2 (2.5 mg) or soy oil (2.5
 mL; control) for 7 d. For each period, blood and milk samples were collected
 from d -4 to 14 (relative to the first injection) to measure PRL,
 insulin-like growth factor-1, and cortisol concentrations. In addition, blood
 samples were collected during morning milking on d -4, 2, and 7 to determine
 the milking-induced PRL release. Mammary gland biopsies were collected on the
 last day of injections. Milk fat samples were collected from d 1 to 7 and on
 d 14. The mRNA levels of genes encoding proteins related to mammary activity
 (alpha-lactalbumin, beta-casein, and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase),
 apoptosis (Bax, Bcl2, and caspase-3), PRL receptors (PRLR; long and short
 forms), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5A and
 STAT5B), and suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS2 and SOCS3) were
 evaluated by real-time reverse transcription PCR using RNA extracted from
 milk fat and mammary biopsies. Milk production was decreased moderately
 (about 9%) by E2 injections during the treatment period. Estradiol injections
 increased basal PRL levels in serum and milk but did not affect
 milking-induced PRL release. Estradiol injections increased the plasma
 concentration of insulin-like growth factor-1 but did not affect cortisol
 concentration during the treatment period. In mammary tissue, the expression
 of Bcl2 was downregulated, whereas that of STAT5A and B and the Bax:Bcl2 mRNA
 ratio was higher during E2 injections. The total STAT5 protein content in
 mammary tissue was elevated by E2 injections. We found no significant
 difference observed for the other genes in mammary tissue or milk fat. The
 present data do not support the contention that E2 injections inhibit milk
 production by interfering with PRL signaling, but enhanced basal PRL
 concentration and STAT5 gene expression in mammary tissue.",
