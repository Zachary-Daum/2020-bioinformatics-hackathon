    abstract "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to investigate the
 fitness of the existing truck seats for Bangladeshi truck drivers and suggest
 a guideline for drivers' seats based on their anthropometry. METHODOLOGY: In
 this study, eight anthropometric measurements of 120 Bangladeshi truck
 drivers and seven seat dimensions of ninety trucks of three brands namely,
 TATA, ASHOK LEYLAND, and ISUZU were considered for investigating the
 considerable mismatch between seat dimensions and drivers' anthropometry. The
 data were analyzed using two-sample t-tests to identify the relationship
 between existing seat dimensions and drivers' anthropometry. RESULTS: The
 results showed a mismatch in seat dimensions and anthropometric measurements
 for nearly all truck brands and the existing seat dimensions were found to be
 inappropriate for Bangladeshi drivers. For all the truck brands, the
 percentage mismatch of seat height, seat depth, seat width, backrest height,
 and steering wheel clearance varied between 71% and 98%, 23% and 79%, 33% and
 84%, 28% and 65%, and 53% and 100% respectively. Subsequently, an attempt was
 made to provide ergonomically correct seat dimensions for Bangladeshi truck
 drivers. Further, generalized equations to design the appropriate seat
 dimensions were developed using the least square regression technique. The
 recommended seat height, depth and width, backrest height, and steering wheel
 clearance were found to be appropriate for 82%, 79%, 76%, 98%, and 100% of
 drivers respectively. CONCLUSION: The analysis and results of this study can
 be useful in developing guidelines for design and manufacture of truck driver
 seats in Bangladesh.",
