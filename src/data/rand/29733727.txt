    abstract "Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening genetic disease that
 causes severe damage to the lungs. Ivacaftor, the first drug that targeted
 the underlying defect of the disease caused by specific mutations, is a
 sterling example of the potential of precision medicine. Clinical trial and
 registry studies showed that ivacaftor improved outcomes and reduced
 hospitalizations. Our study used US administrative claims data to assess the
 real-world effectiveness of ivacaftor. Comparing twelve-month rates before
 and after starting the use of ivacaftor among people who initiated therapy
 during 2012-2015, we found that overall and cystic fibrosis-related inpatient
 admissions fell by 55 percent and 81 percent, respectively. There was a
 comparable reduction in inpatient spending. Ivacaftor appears to be effective
 for multiple mutations that cause the disease, as suggested by the fact that
 during the study period, ivacaftor's use was extended to nine additional
 mutations in 2014. Examination of evidence from clinical trial, clinical
 care, and administrative data sources is important for understanding the
 real-world effectiveness of precision medicines such as ivacaftor.",
