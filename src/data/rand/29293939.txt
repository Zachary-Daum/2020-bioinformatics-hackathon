    abstract "Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) plays a key role during ovarian
 follicular development, with local actions associated with a dynamic
 secretion profile by growing follicles. While results for AMH effects on
 antral follicle growth and function are consistent among studies in various
 species, any effects on preantral follicle development remain controversial.
 Therefore, experiments were conducted to investigate the direct actions and
 role of AMH during follicle development at the preantral stage.
 Macaque-specific short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting AMH mRNA were
 incorporated into adenoviral vectors to decrease AMH gene expression in
 rhesus macaque follicles. Secondary follicles were isolated from adult
 macaque ovaries and cultured individually in the ultra-low-attachment dish
 containing defined medium supplemented with follicle-stimulating hormone and
 insulin for 5 weeks. Follicles were randomly assigned to treatment groups:
 (a) control, (b) nontargeting control shRNA-vector, (c) AMH shRNA-vector, (d)
 AMH shRNA-vector + recombinant human AMH, and (e) recombinant human AMH.
 Follicle survival and growth were assessed. Culture media were analyzed for
 steroid hormone and paracrine factor concentrations. For in vivo study, the
 nontargeting control shRNA-vector and AMH shRNA-vector were injected into
 macaque ovaries. Ovaries were collected 9 days postinjection for morphology
 and immunohistochemistry assessment. Decreased AMH expression reduced
 preantral follicle survival and growth in nonhuman primates. Supplemental AMH
 treatment in the culture media promoted preantral follicle growth to the
 small antral stage in vitro with increased steroid hormone and paracrine
 factor production, as well as oocyte maturation. These data demonstrate that
 AMH is a critical follicular paracrine/autocrine factor positively impacting
 preantral follicle survival and growth in primates.",
