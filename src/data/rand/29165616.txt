    abstract "BACKGROUND: Work system assessments can facilitate successful
 implementation of quality improvement programs. Using a human factors
 engineering approach, we conducted a work system assessment to facilitate the
 dissemination of a quality improvement program for optimizing blood culture
 use in pediatric intensive care units at 2 hospitals. METHODS: Semistructured
 face-to-face interviews were conducted with clinicians from Johns Hopkins All
 Children's Hospital and University of Virginia Medical Center. Interview data
 were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Blood
 culture-ordering practices are influenced by various work system factors,
 including people, tasks, tools and technologies, the physical environment,
 organizational conditions, and the external environment. A clinical
 decision-support tool could facilitate implementation by (1) standardizing
 blood culture-ordering practices, (2) ensuring that prescribing clinicians
 review the patient's condition before ordering a blood culture, (3)
 facilitating critical thinking, and (4) empowering nurses to communicate with
 physicians and advocate for adherence to blood culture-ordering guidelines.
 CONCLUSION: The success of interventions for optimizing blood culture use
 relies heavily on the local context. A work system analysis using a human
 factors engineering approach can identify key areas to be addressed for the
 successful dissemination of quality improvement interventions.",
