    abstract "BACKGROUND: Although various surgical techniques have been used
 to treat irreparable rotator cuff tears (RCTs), debate remains regarding
 which treatment is most effective. The purpose of our study was to compare
 the outcomes of partial rotator cuff repair versus repair with augmentation
 of the tenotomized long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT). METHODS: This study
 included 76 patients with large to massive RCTs. Arthroscopic rotator cuff
 repair with LHBT augmentation was performed in 39 patients (group I), while
 partial repair was performed in 37 patients (group II). Clinical and
 functional outcomes were compared with a visual analog scale for pain and the
 American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant score, and Korean
 Shoulder Score. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed 12 months after
 surgery. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 29.6 +/- 7.8 months (range,
 24-51 months). Significant improvements in pain and clinical scores were
 observed in both groups at the last follow-up. However, there were no
 significant differences in pain, clinical scores, or range of motion between
 the 2 groups at any time point. Retears were observed in 16 patients in group
 I (41.0%) and 14 in group II (37.8%, P = .78). Augmented LHBT pathology was
 observed in 10 patients (25.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Both partial repair and repair
 with LHBT augmentation were effective in improving clinical and radiologic
 outcomes. No significant differences in clinical outcomes or repaired cuff
 integrity were observed between the groups. The investment of operation time
 and effort in augmenting the LHBT in the treatment of irreparable RCTs is not
 recommended.",
