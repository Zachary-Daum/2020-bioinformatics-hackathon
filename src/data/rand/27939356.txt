    abstract "Inclusion-body myositis (IBM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are
 biochemically characterized by the presence of aggregated beta-amyloid
 protein and tau protein. In addition, both diseases are pathologically
 characterized by vacuolar changes, including rimmed vacuoles (RVs) in IBM and
 granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) in AD. Previously, we demonstrated that
 RVs and GVD bodies are associated with a set of common molecules, leading us
 to speculate that both RVs and GVD bodies originate from similar structures
 on the plasma membrane of muscle cells and neuronal cells, namely, the
 neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and the postsynaptic spine especially in terms
 of Wnt signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the presence of
 components of NMJ in RVs and/or postsynaptic spine in GVD bodies respectively
 by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The antigens probed included
 the following: (1) dishevelled (Dvl) family proteins (Dvl1, Dvl2 and Dvl3),
 (2) NMJ-associated proteins (low density lipoprotein-related protein 4
 [Lrp4], heat shock protein 70 [Hsp70], beta-catenin, phospho-beta-catenin,
 rapsyn, P21-activated kinase 1 [PAK1], adenomatous polyposis coli [APC] and
 ADP-ribosylation factor 6 [Arf6]), (3) a lipid raft-associated molecule
 (phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate [PIP2]), and (4) other proteins
 [prion, glycogen-synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta)]. In all cases of sporadic
 IBM examined, RVs were immunopositive for Dvl3, Hsp70, beta-catenin, PIP2,
 APC, prion and GSK-3beta. In all cases of AD examined, GVD bodies were
 immunopositive for Dvl3, phospho-beta-catenin, rapsyn, APC and PIP2. These
 findings show that RVs and GVD bodies share common molecules associated with
 the Wnt signaling pathway, indicating that these structures share a common
 structural and functional origin.",
