    abstract "Plant root systems play essential roles in developmental
 processes, such as the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, and
 structural support. Gene expression is affected by growth conditions and the
 genetic background of plants. To identify highly conserved root-preferred
 genes in rice across diverse growth conditions and varieties, we used two
 independent meta-anatomical expression profiles based on a large collection
 of Affymetrix and Agilent 44K microarray data sets available for public use.
 We then identified 684 loci with root-preferred expression, which were
 validated with in silico analysis using both meta-expression profiles. The
 expression patterns of four candidate genes were confirmed in vivo by
 monitoring expression of beta-glucuronidase under control of the
 candidate-gene promoters, providing new tools to manipulate agronomic traits
 associated with roots. We also utilized real-time PCR to examine the
 root-preferential expression of 14 genes across four rice varieties,
 including japonica and indica cultivars. Using a database of rice genes with
 known functions, we identified the reported functions of 39 out of the 684
 candidate genes. Sixteen genes are directly involved in root development,
 while the remaining are involved in processes indirectly related to root
 development (i.e., soil-stress tolerance or growth retardation). This
 indicates the importance of our candidate genes for studies on root
 development and function. Gene ontology enrichment analysis in the 
'biological processes' category revealed that root-preferred genes in rice are
 closely associated with nutrient transport-related genes, indicating that the
 primary role of roots is the uptake of nutrients from soil. In addition,
 predicted protein-protein interaction analysis suggested a molecular network
 for root development composed of 215 interactions associated with 44
 root-preferred or root development-related genes. Taken together, our data
 provide an important foundation for future research on root development in
 rice.",
