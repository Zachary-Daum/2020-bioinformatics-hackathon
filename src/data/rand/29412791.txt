    abstract "In the present study, sixty-two samples that have 1.5% and upper
 level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), were examined to investigate the
 relationship between HbF level and non-deletional mutations in both Ggamma (G
 gamma) globin (HBG2) and Agamma (A gamma) globin (HBG1) genes. Four
 variations were observed in the promotor of Ggamma gene, which are -158C/T,
 -309A/G, -369C/G, and -567T/G. Also, four variations were observed in the 5
'-UTR (untranslated regions) and promotor of Agamma gene, which are +25G/A,
 -369G/C, -499T/A, and -588G/A. One -222/-225 AGCA del homozygous and six
 variations as heterozygous in A gamma globin gene promotor region were also
 observed. The results of the current study suggested that there was a
 significant relationship between high HbF levels and two variations (-309A/T
 and -369C/G) in Ggamma gene promotor. Additionally, a significant
 relationship between two variations (+25G/A and -499T/A) in Agamma gene
 promotor was also observed. Furthermore, the persons who carry these
 variations with high levels of HbF indicated that there might be a haplotype
 effect between these variations.",
