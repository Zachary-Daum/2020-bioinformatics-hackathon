    abstract "In this work, we report the phytochemical profile and
 antioxidant activity of caper berries (Capparis spinosa L.) before and after
 a fermentation process. The phytochemical profiles were evaluated by
 high-performance liquid chromatography with UV and electrospray ionization
 mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS(n)). Twenty-one compounds were
 characterized, and seven of them quantified. The main component of
 non-fermented berries was glucocapparin, which was degraded upon the
 fermentation process. Most of the compounds were quercetin and kaempferol
 glycosides, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidins. The main differences observed
 upon the fermentation process were a decrease in epicatechin concentration,
 the hydrolysis of quercetin glycosides, and the degradation of
 glucosinolates. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents, as well as the
 antioxidant activities by the in vitro antioxidant assays DPPH and ABTS(+),
 were determined, observing that the values were slightly higher after the
 fermentation process.",
