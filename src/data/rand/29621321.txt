    abstract "Anti-predator signaling is highly variable with numerous
 examples of species employing cryptic coloration to avoid detection or
 conspicuous coloration (often coupled with a secondary defense) to ensure
 detection and recollection. While the ends of this spectrum are clear in
 their function, how species use intermediate signals is less clear.
 Australian Brood Frogs (Pseudophryne) display conspicuous coloration on both
 their dorsum and venter. Coupled with the alkaloid toxins these frogs
 possess, this coloration may be aposematic, providing a protective warning
 signal to predators. We assessed predation rates of known and novel color
 patterns and found no difference for avian or mammalian predators. However,
 when Pseudophryne dorsal phenotypes were collectively compared to the
 high-contrast ventral phenotype of this genus, we found birds, but not
 mammals, attacked dorsal phenotypes significantly less frequently than the
 ventral phenotype. This study, importantly, shows a differential predator
 response to ventral coloration in this genus which has implications for the
 evolution of conspicuous signaling in Pseudophryne.",
