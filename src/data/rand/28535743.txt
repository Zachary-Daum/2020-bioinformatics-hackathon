    abstract "BACKGROUND: Moringa oleifera leaf powder (MLP) is a
 nutrient-rich and readily available food resource that has the potential to
 improve the micronutrient quality of complementary foods in developing
 countries. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acceptability of complementary foods
 fortified with MLP. METHODS: Moringa oleifera leaf powder was fed to infants
 either as part of a cereal-legume complementary food blend (MCL-35 g) or by
 sprinkling as a food supplement (MS-5 g) on infant's usual foods.
 Mother-infant pairs (n = 18 for the MCL-35 g group and n = 16 for the MS-5 g
 group) attending regular weight monitoring sessions were recruited to
 participate in the acceptability trial. The study consisted of an initial
 tasting session after which mothers were to feed the assigned foods to their
 infants for 14 days. Mothers rated color, odor, taste, and overall liking of
 the complementary foods using a 5-point hedonic scale. Primary outcome was
 the proportion of test porridge consumed. RESULTS: On the tasting day, MCL-35
 g group infants consumed an average of 64.27% +/- 25.02 of the test porridge
 offered, whereas MS-5 g group infants consumed an average of 66.43% +/-
 29.09. During the 14-day period, median percent daily consumption for MCL-35
 g was 71.5% of the daily recommended intake, whereas median percent daily
 consumption for MS-5 g was 86.2%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that complementary
 foods incorporating Moringa oleifera leaf powder either as part of a
 cereal-legume complementary food blend (MCL-35 g) or when sprinkled as a food
 supplement (MS-5 g) on infant's usual foods were well accepted.",
