    abstract "Burkholderia pseudomallei is a flagellated, gram-negative
 environmental bacterium that causes melioidosis, a severe infectious disease
 of humans and animals in tropical areas. We hypothesised that B. pseudomallei
 may undergo phenotypic adaptation in response to an increase in growth
 temperature. We analysed the growth curves of B. pseudomallei strain 153
 cultured in Luria-Bertani broth at five different temperatures (25  degrees
 C-42  degrees C) and compared the proteomes of bacteria cultured at 37 
 degrees C and 42  degrees C. B. pseudomallei exhibited the highest growth
 rate at 37  degrees C with modest reductions at 30  degrees C, 40  degrees C
 and 42  degrees C but a more marked delay at 25  degrees C. Proteome analysis
 revealed 34 differentially expressed protein spots between bacterial cultures
 at 42  degrees C versus 37  degrees C. These were identified as chaperones (7
 spots), metabolic enzymes (12 spots), antioxidants (10 spots), motility
 proteins (2 spots), structural proteins (2 spots) and hypothetical proteins
 (1 spot). Of the 22 down-regulated proteins at 42  degrees C, redundancy in
 motility and antioxidant proteins was observed. qRT-PCR confirmed decreased
 expression of fliC and katE. Experiments on three B. pseudomallei strains
 demonstrated that these had the highest motility, greatest resistance to H2O2
 and greatest tolerance to salt stress at 37  degrees C. Our data suggest that
 temperature affects B. pseudomallei motility and resistance to stress.",
