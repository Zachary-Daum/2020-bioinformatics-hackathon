    abstract "BACKGROUND: Limited intimal tears (LITs) of the aorta (Class 3
 dissection variant) are the least common form of aortic pathology in patients
 presenting with acute aortic syndrome (AAS). LITs are difficult to detect on
 imaging and may be underappreciated. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to
 describe the frequency, pathology, treatment, and outcome of LITs compared
 with other AAS, and to demonstrate that LITs can be detected pre-operatively
 by contemporary imaging. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 497
 patients admitted for 513 AAS events at a single academic aortic center
 between 2003 and 2012. AAS were classified into classic dissection (AD),
 intramural hematoma, LIT, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and rupturing
 thoracic aortic aneurysm. The prevalence, pertinent risk factors, and
 detailed imaging findings with surgical and pathological correlation of LITs
 are described. Management, early outcomes, and late mortality are reported.
 RESULTS: Among 497 patients with AAS, the authors identified 24 LITs (4.8% of
 AAS) in 16 men and 8 women (17 type A, 7 type B). Patients with LITs were
 older than those with AD, and type A LITs had similarly dilated ascending
 aortas as type A AD. Three patients presented with rupture. Eleven patients
 underwent urgent surgical aortic replacement, and 2 patients underwent
 endovascular repair. Medial degeneration was present in all surgical
 specimens. In-hospital mortality was 4% (1 of 24), and in total, 5 patients
 with LIT died subsequently at 1.5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.3 to
 2.5 years). Computed tomography imaging detected all but 1 LIT, best
 visualized on volume-rendered images. CONCLUSIONS: LITs are rare acute aortic
 lesions within the dissection spectrum, with similar presentation,
 complications, and outcomes compared with AD and intramural hematoma.
 Awareness of this lesion allows pre-operative diagnosis using high-quality
 computed tomography angiography.",
