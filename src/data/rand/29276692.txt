    abstract "Since the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), circulating miRNAs
 have been proposed as biomarkers for disease. Consequently, many groups have
 tried to identify circulating miRNA biomarkers for various types of diseases
 including cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, the replicability of
 these experiments has been disappointingly low. In order to identify
 circulating miRNA candidate biomarkers, in general, first an unbiased
 high-throughput screen is performed in which a large number of miRNAs is
 detected and quantified in the circulation. Because these are costly
 experiments, many of such studies have been performed using a low number of
 study subjects (small sample size). Due to lack of power in small sample size
 experiments, true effects are often missed and many of the detected effects
 are wrong. Therefore, it is important to have a good estimate of the
 appropriate sample size for a miRNA high-throughput screen. In this review,
 we discuss the effects of small sample sizes in high-throughput screens for
 circulating miRNAs. Using data from a miRNA high-throughput experiment on
 isolated monocytes, we illustrate that the implementation of power
 calculations in a high-throughput miRNA discovery experiment will avoid
 unnecessarily large and expensive experiments, while still having enough
 power to be able to detect clinically important differences.",
