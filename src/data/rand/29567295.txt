    abstract "A series of 3-substituted pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives as BTK
 inhibitors were designed by structure-based drug design and they were
 synthesized, evaluated by enzyme-based assay and anti-proliferation against
 Ramos and Raji cells. Most of them displayed good inhibitory activities
 against both BTK and B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia lines in vitro. Among
 them, compound 8a exhibited excellent potency (IC50=7.95nM against BTK
 enzyme, 8.91muM against Ramos cells and 1.80muM against Raji cells), with a
 better hydrophilicity (ClogP=3.33). These explorations provided new clues to
 discover 3-substituted pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives as novel anti-tumor
 agents.",
