    abstract "Background: A modified European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society
 (mENETS) staging system has been confirmed to be more suitable for pancreatic
 neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) when compared to the American Joint Committee
 on Cancer (AJCC) or the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) systems
 in the last few years. However, the importance of N stage has been recently
 published with several significant updates. Methods: SEER registry (n =
 2,209) was used to evaluate the application of the AJCC 7th staging system,
 ENETS staging system, mENETS staging system and reformed ENETS (rENETS)
 staging system in this study. Results: For the ENETS staging system, patients
 with stage I disease had a similar prognosis to patients with stage II
 disease (P=0.154), and patients with stage IIIA and stage IIIB diseases
 showed adverse prognostic potential. The proportion of patients with stage
 III diseases using AJCC 7th staging system was extremely lower than those
 with mENETS staging system or rENETS staging system (3.6%, 23.0% and 23.7%,
 respectively). Furthermore, the hazard ratio of death for patients with stage
 II or III disease using rENETS staging system was slightly higher than that
 of mENETS staging system. Besides, survival curves were better separated by
 rENETS staging system. A prognostic nomogram for overall survival (OS) was
 formulated to obtain superior discriminatory abilities. Conclusions: The
 rENETS staging system has superior distribution in proportion than the AJCC
 7th, ENETS or mENETS staging system, and one more accurate and advanced
 predictive model will be achieved via the incorporation to be adopted in
 clinical practice.",
