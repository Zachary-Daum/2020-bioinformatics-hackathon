    abstract "Purpose The aim of the study was to determine the impact of
 telephone follow-up calls on satisfaction in oncology patients after hospital
 discharge. Method A randomized controlled study, in which patients were
 randomized into two groups: The experimental group with the telephone
 follow-up (TFU) calls (intervention) and the control group (no intervention).
 The telephone follow-up call was conducted within 72 h after discharge.
 During the call, patients were asked about their medications, namely, whether
 they received them, understood how to take them, and whether they developed
 any medication-related adverse effect. Both groups were contacted by phone
 two weeks later to assess their satisfaction with the discharge medication
 instructions and the provided pharmaceutical services, using the 5-point
 Likert scale. In addition, hospital records were reviewed for emergency room
 visits and hospital readmissions within 30 days after discharge. Results
 There was no difference in the percentage of patients who reported being very
 satisfied between both the intervention and the control groups (45%
 intervention vs. 48% control, P = 0.68). The mean time of the intervention
 phone call was 3 +/- 1.7 (SD) min. During the telephone follow-up call,
 medication-related problems were identified in 20% of the patients. There was
 no significant difference in emergency room visits and hospital readmissions
 in the intervention group vs. control (44% vs. 53%, P = 0.123) and (37% vs.
 43%, P = 0.317), respectively. Conclusion Telephone follow-up calls conducted
 by a pharmacist to discharged oncology patients did not improve patients'
 satisfaction, emergency room visits or hospital readmissions; however, they
 helped to identify medication-related adverse effects in the oncology
 patients.",
