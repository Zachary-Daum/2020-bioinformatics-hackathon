    abstract "Tonsillectomy is among the most commonly performed operations in
 children. Although follicular lymphoid hyperplasia is usually the main and
 only pathologic finding at microscopic examination, a variety of other rare
 but important pathologic changes may be encountered. This review aims to
 provide an inclusive practical resource and reference for both training and
 practising pathologists. It discusses the spectrum of pathologic findings,
 including both neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions and provides
 illustrative images.",
