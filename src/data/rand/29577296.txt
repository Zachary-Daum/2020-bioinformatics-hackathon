    abstract "BACKGROUND: Only recently the concept of prebiotics has been
 introduced in oral health. Few potential oral prebiotics have already been
 identified in dual species competition assays, showing a stimulatory effect
 on beneficial bacteria and by this suppressing the outgrowth of pathogenic
 species. This study aimed to validate the effect of previously identified
 potential prebiotic substrates on multispecies cultures by shifting the
 biofilm composition towards a more beneficial species dominated microbiota.
 METHODS: A chemostat culture containing 14 model oral bacterial species was
 used to grow biofilms for 24 hours which subsequently were treated with
 prebiotic solutions three times a day for 3 consecutive days. Further the
 influence of environmental factors such as pH, nutrient availability, oxygen
 concentration and prebiotic dose on the efficacy of the prebiotic substances
 was investigated. RESULTS: Three potential prebiotic substrates
 N-acetyl-D-mannosamine, succinic acid and Met-Pro were able to bring the
 beneficial proportion to > 95%. While the pH of the prebiotic solution did
 not have an influence on the prebiotic effect, the interplay of nutrient
 availability, oxygen concentration and prebiotic treatment resulted in
 significant changes of the microbial composition identifying
 N-acetyl-D-mannosamine as the most promising oral prebiotic substrate.
 Showing a clear dose dependent effect, concentrations of
 N-acetyl-D-mannosamine of 1.0 and 1.5 M resulted in a biofilm composition of
 97% beneficial species. CONCLUSION: Introducing the prebiotic concept in oral
 health might reveal a valid approach for treatment and prevention of oral
 diseases and promote oral health.",
