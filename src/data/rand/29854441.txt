    abstract "Objective: To estimate which risk factors (sociodemographic,
 lifestyle, and health conditions) are associated with overweight and obesity
 in Japanese-Brazilians. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out
 with Japanese-Brazilians living in the southern region of Brazil. Data were
 collected between March and December of 2016 through a household survey
 addressing sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and health
 conditions. Data were analyzed by means of logistic regression considering
 95% level of significance. Results: A total of 542 Japanese-Brazilians with a
 mean age of 47.75 years were evaluated; 52.8% were eutrophic, 36.9% were
 overweight, and 10.3% were people with obesity. The following variables
 remained associated with overweight after adjustments; male gender (ORaj =
 1.85, CI = 1.24-2.76), age range of 40-49 years (ORaj = 2.27, CI =
 1.10-4.68), and 50 to 59 years (ORaj = 2.17, CI = 1.004-4.72), alcohol
 consumption (ORaj = 2.11, CI = 1.07-4.16), and presence of chronic disease
 (ORaj = 1.59, CI = 1.02-2.46). The following were independent factors
 associated with obesity: male gender (ORaj = 3.63, CI = 1.78-7.40), the
 presence of chronic disease (ORaj = 4.13, CI = 1.96-8.71), the age range of
 30 to 39 years (ORaj = 4.74, CI = 1.65-13.64) and 40 to 49 years (ORaj =
 2.89, CI = 1.05-7.95), and irregularly active lifestyle (ORaj = 2.73, CI =
 1.12-6.69). Conclusion: The results of this study show that being a male in
 the age range of 30-49 years old, alcohol consumption, and presence of
 chronic disease are associated with overweight and obesity in
 Japanese-Brazilians.",
