    abstract "The effects of microwave irradiation on the digestibility and
 biogas production of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) and
 cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) leaves were investigated using
 biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays. Cow dung was utilised as
 inoculum. Different microwave powers (87.5, 175 and 350W) were applied in a
 first set of runs for 15min. The second set consisted of 20, 25 and 30min
 irradiation at 350W. Based on ANOVA analysis (alpha=0.05), biogas production
 was significantly higher for the irradiated substrates compared to controls.
 The peak biogas production was 700ml for 36days HRT for 350W/25min. Peak COD,
 SCOD, volatile and total solids removals were 54.84%, 39.08%, 34.60% and
 71.96%, respectively. Phosphate and total nitrogen increased significantly.
 Cumulative biogas production data fitted the modified Gompertz equation well.
 The highest biogas yield was 0.271L/g VSremoved at a 350W microwave
 irradiation for 30min.",
