    abstract "Hemophilia A is a common hereditary bleeding disorder that is
 characterized by a deficiency of human blood coagulation factor VIII
 (hFVIII). Previous studies with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors
 identified two liver-specific promoter and enhancer combinations (E03.TTR and
 E12.A1AT) that drove high level expression of a codon-optimized,
 B-domain-deleted hFVIII transgene in a mouse model of the disease. This study
 further evaluated these enhancer/promoter combinations in cynomolgus macaques
 using two different AAV capsids (AAVrh10 and AAVhu37). Each of the four
 vector combinations was administered intravenously at a dose of 1.2 x 10(13)
 genome copy/kg into five macaques per group. Delivery of the hFVIII transgene
 via the AAVhu37 capsid resulted in a substantial increase in hFVIII
 expression compared to animals administered with AAVrh10 vectors. Two weeks
 after administration of E03.TTR packaged within the AAVhu37 capsid, average
 hFVIII expression was 20.2 +/- 5.0% of normal, with one animal exhibiting
 peak expression of 37.1% of normal hFVIII levels. The majority of animals
 generated an anti-hFVIII antibody response by week 8-10 post vector delivery.
 However, two of the five macaques administered with AAVhu37.E03.TTR were free
 of a detectable antibody response for 30 weeks post vector administration.
 Overall, the study supports the continued development of AAV-based gene
 therapeutics for hemophilia A using the AAVhu37 capsid.",
