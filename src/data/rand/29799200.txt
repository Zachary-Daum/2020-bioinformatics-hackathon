    abstract "Aquaporin Z (AqpZ) is an integral membrane protein that
 facilitates transport of water across Escherichia coli cells with a high
 rate. Previously, R189, a highly conserved residue of the selective filter of
 AqpZ, was proposed as a gate within the water channel on the basis of the
 observation of both open and closed conformations of its side chain in
 different monomers of an X-ray structure, and the observation of rapid
 switches between the two conformations in molecular dynamic simulations.
 However, the gating mechanism of the R189 side chain remains controversial
 since it is unclear whether the different conformations observed in the X-ray
 structure is due to different functional states or is a result of
 perturbation of non-native detergent environments. Herein, in native-like
 synthetic bilayers and native E. coli membranes, a number of solid-state NMR
 techniques are employed to examine gating mechanism of the R189 side chain of
 AqpZ. One R189 side-chain conformation is highly evident since only a set of
 peaks corresponding to the R189 side chain is observed in 2D (15)N-(13)C
 spectra. The immobility of the R189 side chain is detected by (1)H-(15)N
 dipolar lineshapes, excluding the possibility of the rapid switches between
 the two side-chain conformations. High-resolution monomeric structure of
 AqpZ, determined by CS-Rosetta calculations using experimentally measured
 distance restraints related to the R189 side chain, reveals that this side
 chain is in an open conformation, which is further verified by its water
 accessibility. All the solid-state NMR experimental results, combining with
 water permeability essay, suggest a permanently open conformation of the R189
 side chain in the synthetic bilayer and native membranes. This study provides
 new structural insights into the gating mechanism of aquaporins and
 highlights the significance of lipid bilayer environments in elucidating the
 molecular mechanism of membrane proteins.",
