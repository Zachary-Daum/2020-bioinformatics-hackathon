    abstract "In this work, we derive and analyze a 2n+1-dimensional
 deterministic differential equation modeling the transmission and treatment
 of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) disease. The model is extended to a
 stochastic differential equation by introducing noise in the transmission
 rate of the disease. A theoretical treatment strategy of regular HIV testing
 and immediate treatment with Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is investigated in
 the presence and absence of noise. By defining R0, n, Rt, n and Rt,n as the
 deterministic basic reproduction number in the absence of ART treatments,
 deterministic basic reproduction number in the presence of ART treatments and
 stochastic reproduction number in the presence of ART treatment,
 respectively, we discuss the stability of the infection-free and endemic
 equilibrium in the presence and absence of treatments by first deriving the
 closed form expression for R0, n, Rt, n and Rt,n. We show that there is
 enough treatment to avoid persistence of infection in the endemic equilibrium
 state if Rt,n=1. We further show by studying the effect of noise in the
 transmission rate of the disease that transient epidemic invasion can still
 occur even if Rt, n<1. This happens due to the presence of noise (with high
 intensity) in the transmission rate, causing Rt,n>1. A threshold criterion
 for epidemic invasion in the presence and absence of noise is derived.
 Numerical simulation is presented for validation.",
