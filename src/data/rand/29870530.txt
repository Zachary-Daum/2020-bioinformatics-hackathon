    abstract "Brucellosis is essentially a disease of domesticated livestock;
 however, humans can also be infected via the consumption of contaminated meat
 or dairy products, underlying the need for rapid and accurate identification
 methods. Procedures for microbiological identification and typing of Brucella
 spp. are expensive, time-consuming, and must be conducted in biohazard
 containment facilities to minimize operator risk. The development of a
 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
 (MALDI-TOF-MS)-based assay has reduced the processing time while maintaining
 performance standards. In this study, to improve the identification accuracy
 and suitability of the MALDI-TOF-based assay for routine diagnosis, we
 developed a new protein extraction protocol and generated a custom reference
 database containing Brucella strains representative of the most widespread
 species. The reference library was then challenged with blind-coded field
 samples isolated from infected animals. The results indicated that the
 database could be used to correctly identify 99.5% and 97% of Brucella
 strains at the genus and species level, respectively, indicating that the
 performance of the assay was not affected by the different culture conditions
 used for microbial isolation. Moreover, the inactivated samples were stored
 and shipped to reference laboratories with no ill effect on protein
 stability, thus confirming the reliability of our method for routine
 diagnosis. Finally, we evaluated the epidemiological value of the protocol by
 comparing the clustering analysis results of Brucella melitensis strains
 obtained via multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis or
 MALDI-TOF MS. The results showed that the MALDI-TOF assay could not decipher
 the true phylogenetic tree, suggesting that the protein profile did not
 correspond with the genetic evolution of Brucella.",
