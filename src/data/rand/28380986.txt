    abstract "This work presents a novel nonlinear control system designed for
 interferometry based on variable structure control and sliding modes. This
 approach can fully compensate the nonlinear behavior of the interferometer
 and lead to high accuracy control for large disturbances, featuring low cost,
 ease of implementation and high robustness, without a reset circuit (when
 compared with a linear control system). A deep stability analysis was
 accomplished and the global asymptotic stability of the system was proved.
 The results showed that the nonlinear control is able to keep the
 interferometer in the quadrature point and suppress signal fading for
 arbitrary signals, sinusoidal signals, or zero input signal, even under
 strong external disturbances. The system showed itself suitable to
 characterize a multi-axis piezoelectric flextentional actuator, which
 displacements that are much smaller than half wavelength. The high robustness
 allows the system to be embedded and to operate in harsh environments as
 factories, bringing the interferometry outside the laboratory.",
