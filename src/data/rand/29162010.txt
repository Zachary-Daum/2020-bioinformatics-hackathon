    abstract "Under the goal-driven paradigm, Yamins et al. ( 2014 ; Yamins &
 DiCarlo, 2016 ) have shown that by optimizing only the final eight-way
 categorization performance of a four-layer hierarchical network, not only can
 its top output layer quantitatively predict IT neuron responses but its
 penultimate layer can also automatically predict V4 neuron responses.
 Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) in the field of computer vision have
 reached image object categorization performance comparable to that of human
 beings on ImageNet, a data set that contains 1.3 million training images of
 1000 categories. We explore whether the DNN neurons (units in DNNs) possess
 image object representational statistics similar to monkey IT neurons,
 particularly when the network becomes deeper and the number of image
 categories becomes larger, using VGG19, a typical and widely used deep
 network of 19 layers in the computer vision field. Following Lehky, Kiani,
 Esteky, and Tanaka ( 2011 , 2014 ), where the response statistics of 674 IT
 neurons to 806 image stimuli are analyzed using three measures (kurtosis,
 Pareto tail index, and intrinsic dimensionality), we investigate the three
 issues in this letter using the same three measures: (1) the similarities and
 differences of the neural response statistics between VGG19 and primate IT
 cortex, (2) the variation trends of the response statistics of VGG19 neurons
 at different layers from low to high, and (3) the variation trends of the
 response statistics of VGG19 neurons when the numbers of stimuli and neurons
 increase. We find that the response statistics on both single-neuron
 selectivity and population sparseness of VGG19 neurons are fundamentally
 different from those of IT neurons in most cases; by increasing the number of
 neurons in different layers and the number of stimuli, the response
 statistics of neurons at different layers from low to high do not
 substantially change; and the estimated intrinsic dimensionality values at
 the low convolutional layers of VGG19 are considerably larger than the value
 of approximately 100 reported for IT neurons in Lehky et al. ( 2014 ),
 whereas those at the high fully connected layers are close to or lower than
 100. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to analyze
 the response statistics of DNN neurons with respect to primate IT neurons in
 image object representation.",
