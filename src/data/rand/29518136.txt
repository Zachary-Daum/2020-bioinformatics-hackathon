    abstract "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia and a
 significant economic burden. Antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae has become
 more prevalent in recent years and many pneumonia cases are caused by S.
 pneumoniae that is resistant to at least one antibiotic. The ubiquitin ligase
 natural killer lytic-associated molecule (NKLAM/RNF19b) plays a role in
 innate immunity and studies using NKLAM-knockout (NKLAM-KO) macrophages have
 demonstrated that NKLAM positively affects the transcriptional activity of
 STAT1. Using an inhalation infection model, we found that NKLAM-KO mice had a
 significantly higher lung bacterial load than WT mice but had less lung
 inflammation. Coincidently, NKLAM-KO mice had fewer neutrophils and NK cells
 in their lungs. NKLAM-KO mice also expressed less iNOS in their lungs as well
 as less MCP-1, MIP1alpha, TNFalpha, IL-12, and IFNgamma. Both neutrophils and
 macrophages from NKLAM-KO mice were defective in killing S. pneumoniae as
 compared to wild type cells (WT). The phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in
 NKLAM-KO lungs was lower than in WT lungs at 24 hours post-infection.
 NKLAM-KO mice were afforded some protection against a lethal dose of S.
 pneumoniae compared to WT mice. In summary, our novel data demonstrate a role
 for E3 ubiquitin ligase NKLAM in modulating innate immunity via the positive
 regulation of inflammatory cytokine expression and bactericidal activity.",
