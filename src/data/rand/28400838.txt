    abstract "HemoHIM, herbal preparation has designed for immune system
 recovery. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of HemoHIM on
 cigarette smoke (CS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease (COPD) mouse model. To induce COPD, C57BL/6 mice were
 exposed to CS for 1 h per day (eight cigarettes per day) for 4 weeks and
 intranasally received LPS on day 26. HemoHIM was administrated to mice at a
 dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg 1h before CS exposure. HemoHIM reduced the
 inflammatory cell count and levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor
 (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta in the broncho-alveolar lavage
 fluid (BALF) induced by CS+LPS exposure. HemoHIM decreased the inflammatory
 cell infiltration in the airway and inhibited the expression of iNOS and
 MMP-9 and phosphorylation of Erk in lung tissue exposed to CS+LPS. In
 summary, our results indicate that HemoHIM inhibited a reduction in the lung
 inflammatory response on CS and LPS induced lung inflammation via the Erk
 pathway. Therefore, we suggest that HemoHIM has the potential to treat
 pulmonary inflammatory disease such as COPD.",
