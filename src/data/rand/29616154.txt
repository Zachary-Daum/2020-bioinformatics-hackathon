    abstract "Purpose: To compare the postoperative higher-order-aberrations
 (HOAs) after hyperopic small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE), hyperopic
 laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), and lenticule implantation for
 correction of hyperopia. Methods: Eighteen monkeys were divided to six
 groups: +2.00 D and +4.00 D hyperopic SMILE, +2.00 D and +4.00 D hyperopic
 LASIK (n = 6 eyes for each), and lenticule implantation with a -2.00 D and
 -4.00 D lenticule (n = 3 eyes for each). The corneal HOAs were evaluated
 preoperatively and 3-month postoperatively. Results: At 3-month
 postoperatively, the spherical aberrations significantly increased toward
 negative direction in all +4.00 D groups (all P < 0.05). There was a
 significant change toward more negative values in the third-order vertical
 coma in the SMILE +4.00 D and LASIK +4.00 D groups (P = 0.026 and P = 0.036,
 respectively). There were also significant changes in the third-order
 horizontal trefoil (P = 0.034) and oblique secondary astigmatism (P = 0.012)
 in the LASIK +4.00 D group. In the eyes that underwent +4.00 D lenticule
 implantation, the fourth-order horizontal quatrefoil significantly increased
 (P = 0.029). In low hyperopia correction (+2.00 D), treatment with lenticule
 implantation tended to have less changes in HOAs, compared to the other two
 groups. Conclusions: In hyperopic SMILE, hyperopic LASIK or lenticule
 implantation surgery, significant induction of third- and fourth-order HOAs
 were seen in moderate hyperopia correction but not in low hyperopia
 correction. In low hyperopia treatment, lenticule implantation might offer a
 favorable trend in the aspect of HOAs. Translational Relevance: The results
 provided the knowledge of surgically induced HOAs and understanding of the
 effects of surgery in different types of hyperopic correction.",
