    abstract "Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) is an abundant urinary protein of
 renal origin. We hypothesize that THP can act as an inhibitor of complement
 since THP binds complement 1q (C1q) of the classical complement pathway,
 inhibits activation of this pathway, and is important in decreasing renal
 ischemia-reperfusion injury (a complement-mediated condition). In this study,
 we began to investigate whether THP interacted with the alternate complement
 pathway via complement factor H (CFH). THP was shown to bind CFH using ligand
 blots and in an ELISA (KD of 1 x 10-6 M). Next, the ability of THP to alter
 CFH's normal action as it functioned as a cofactor in complement factor I
 (CFI)-mediated complement 3b (C3b) degradation was investigated.
 Unexpectedly, control experiments in these in vitro assays suggested that
 THP, without added CFH, could act as a cofactor in CFI-mediated C3b
 degradation. This cofactor activity was present equally in THP isolated from
 10 different individuals. While an ELISA demonstrated small amounts of CFH
 contaminating THP samples, these CFH amounts were insufficient to explain the
 degree of cofactor activity present in THP. An ELISA demonstrated that THP
 directly bound C3b (KD ~ 5 x 10-8 m), a prerequisite for a protein acting as
 a C3b degradation cofactor. The cofactor activity of THP likely resides in
 the protein portion of THP since partially deglycosylated THP still retained
 cofactor activity. In conclusion, THP appears to participate directly in
 complement inactivation by its ability to act as a cofactor for C3b
 degradation, thus adding support to the hypothesis that THP might act as an
 endogenous urinary tract inhibitor of complement.",
