    abstract "Dengue is currently the highest and rapidly spreading
 vector-borne viral disease, which can lead to mortality in its severe form.
 The globally endemic dengue poses as a public health and economic challenge
 that has been attempted to suppress though application of various prevention
 and control techniques. Therefore, broad spectrum techniques, that are
 efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable, are proposed and
 practiced in dengue-endemic regions. The development of vaccines and
 immunotherapies have introduced a new dimension for effective dengue control
 and prevention. Thus, the present study focuses on the preventive and control
 strategies that are currently employed to counter dengue. While traditional
 control strategies bring temporary sustainability alone, implementation of
 novel biotechnological interventions, such as sterile insect technique,
 paratransgenesis, and production of genetically modified vectors, has
 improved the efficacy of the traditional strategies. Although a large-scale
 vector control strategy can be limited, innovative vaccine candidates have
 provided evidence for promising dengue prevention measures. The use of
 tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) has been the most effective so far in
 treating dengue infections. Nonetheless, challenges and limitation hinder the
 progress of developing integrated intervention methods and vaccines; while
 the improvement in the latest techniques and vaccine formulation continues,
 one can hope for a future without the threat of dengue virus.",
