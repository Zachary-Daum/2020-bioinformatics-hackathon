    abstract "Integrated PET/MRI is a hybrid imaging technique enabling
 clinicians to acquire diagnostic images for tumor assessment and treatment
 monitoring with both high soft tissue contrast and added metabolic
 information. Integrated PET/MRI has shown to be valuable in the clinical
 setting and has many promising future applications. The protocol presented
 here will provide step-by-step instructions for the acquisition of whole-body
 2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/MRI data in children with
 cancer. It also provides instructions on how to combine a whole-body staging
 scan with a local tumor scan for evaluation of the primary tumor. The focus
 of this protocol is to be both comprehensive and time-efficient, which are
 two ubiquitous needs for clinical applications. This protocol was originally
 developed for children above 6 years, or old enough to comply with
 breath-hold instructions, but can also be applied to patients under general
 anesthesia. Similarly, this protocol can be modified to fit institutional
 preferences in terms of choice of MRI pulse sequences for both the whole-body
 scan and local tumor assessment.",
