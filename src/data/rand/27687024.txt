    abstract "Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been documented in
 >50% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, due to a complex
 interplay between traditional risk factors and SLE-related factors. Various
 processes, such as coronary artery disease, myocarditis, dilated
 cardiomyopathy, vasculitis, valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension
 and heart failure, account for CVD complications in SLE. Methods
 Electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography (echo), nuclear techniques, cardiac
 computed tomography (CT), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and cardiac
 catheterization (CCa) can detect CVD in SLE at an early stage. ECG and echo
 are the cornerstones of CVD evaluation in SLE. The routine use of cardiac CT
 and nuclear techniques is limited by radiation exposure and use of iodinated
 contrast agents. Additionally, nuclear techniques are also limited by low
 spatial resolution that does not allow detection of sub-endocardial and
 sub-epicardial lesions. CCa gives definitive information about coronary
 artery anatomy and pulmonary artery pressure and offers the possibility of
 interventional therapy. However, it carries the risk of invasive
 instrumentation. Recently, CMR was proved of great value in the evaluation of
 cardiac function and the detection of myocardial inflammation, stress-rest
 perfusion defects and fibrosis. Results An algorithm for CVD evaluation in
 SLE includes clinical, laboratory, ECG and echo assessment as well as CMR
 evaluation in patients with inconclusive findings, persistent cardiac
 symptoms despite normal standard evaluation, new onset of life-threatening
 arrhythmia/heart failure and/or as a tool to select SLE patients for CCa.
 Conclusions A non-invasive approach including clinical, laboratory and
 imaging evaluation is key for early CVD detection in SLE.",
