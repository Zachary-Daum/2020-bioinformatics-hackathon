    abstract "Arsenic trioxide (As2O3; ATO), a traditional Chinese medicine,
 is used to treat patients with acute promye-locytic leukemia, while its
 application for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is still
 under evaluation. The high expression of INF-gamma (INF-gamma) is a primary
 pathogenic factor in SLE. It is found that ATO can reduce INF-gamma
 expression levels in lupus-prone mice, whereas it is not clear whether ATO
 has the same effect on SLE patients. Therefore, this study was to investigate
 the underlying mechanism of the effects of ATO on the expression of INF-gamma
 in splenocytes of MRL/lpr mice and PBMCs of human lupus. The mRNA and protein
 expression levels of INF-gamma were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA,
 respectively. The histone acetylation status of the INF-gamma promoter and
 the binding of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) to the INF-gamma promoter were
 detected using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique. The mRNA and
 protein expression levels of INF-gamma decreased in both splenocytes of
 MRL/lpr mice and PBMCs of SLE patients with ATO treatment, which were
 accompanied by reduced histone H4 and H3 acetylation in INF-gamma promoter
 and decreased combination of RNA Pol II to the INF-gamma promoter. Therefore,
 ATO may reduce the expression level of the INF-gamma by altering the levels
 of INF-gamma promoter acetylation and the combination of RNA Pol II to the
 INF-gamma promoter in splenocytes of MRL/lpr mice and PBMCs of SLE patients.",
