    abstract "The current study was carried out to investigate the role of
 exogenous sulphur (K2SO4: S; 60mgSkg(-1) sand) and calcium (CaCl2: Ca; 250mg
 Cakg(-1) sand) individually as well as in combination (S + Ca) in
 ameliorating the inhibitory effect of As (Na2HAsO4.7H2O: As1; 15mg Askg(-1)
 sand and As2; 30mg Askg(-1) sand) by analyzing biomass accumulation, mineral
 nutrients uptake, photosynthetic pigments content, redox status of the cell,
 enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense system in Brassica juncea L. seedlings.
 Biomass accumulation, uptake of mineral nutrients, photosynthetic pigments
 (chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids) content and the activity of proline
 dehydrogenase (ProDH) declined with increasing accumulation of As in root as
 well as leaves in As dose dependent manner. Contrary to this, exogenous
 application of S, Ca and S + Ca, markedly reduced the negative impact of As
 on above captioned traits except ProDH activity. On the other hand, ROS and
 their biomarkers (superoxide radical; O(2) -, hydrogen peroxide; H2O2,
 malondialdehyde; MDA equivalents content and membrane damage; electrolyte
 leakage), activities of enzymatic (superoxide dismutase; SOD, peroxidase;
 POD, catalase; CAT and glutathione-S-transferase; GST) and non-enzymatic
 antioxidant i.e. proline (Pro) content and its enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate
 synthetase; P5CS activity were increased in root and leaves under As stress.
 While, exogenous application of S, Ca and S + Ca, further enhanced the
 activities of above mentioned enzymes and Pro content thereby causing
 considerable reduction in O(2) -, H2O2, MDA equivalents content and
 electrolyte leakage. This study suggests that exogenous application of S
 and/or Ca efficiently (particularly S + Ca) lowered the negative impact of As
 on biomass accumulation in Brassica seedlings by improving the uptake of
 essential mineral nutrients', content of photosynthetic pigments, activities
 of enzymatic and content of non-enzymatic antioxidants.",
