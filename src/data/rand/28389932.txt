    abstract "The non-inferiority of oral ibandronate 100 mg to intravenous
 (i.v.) ibandronate 1 mg in increasing lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density
 (BMD) after 12 months of treatment was demonstrated in the randomized, phase
 III MOVEST study. We conducted subgroup analyses in the per-protocol set of
 the study (n = 183 oral ibandronate; n = 189 i.v. ibandronate). In patients
 with LS BMD T score >/= -3.0 or < -3.0 at screening, LS BMD gains from
 baseline were 4.42 and 5.79%, respectively, with oral ibandronate, and 4.60
 and 5.83%, respectively, with i.v. ibandronate. LS BMD gains in patients with
 or without prevalent vertebral fractures were 5.21 and 5.23%, respectively,
 with oral ibandronate, and 5.01 and 5.49%, respectively, with i.v.
 ibandronate. In patients aged <75 or >/=75 years, LS BMD gains were 5.46 and
 4.51%, respectively, with oral ibandronate, and 5.25 and 5.77%, respectively,
 with i.v. ibandronate. LS BMD gains in patients with baseline
 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels >/=20 or <20 ng/mL were 5.35 and 4.76%,
 respectively, with oral ibandronate, and 5.05 and 6.57%, respectively, with
 i.v. ibandronate. Similar results were obtained in patients with or without
 prior bisphosphonate (BP) treatment, and in those receiving osteoporosis drug
 treatment other than BPs. In conclusion, oral ibandronate 100 mg demonstrated
 comparable BMD gains with monthly i.v. ibandronate, and thus shows high
 utility in the lifestyle and disease conditions associated with osteoporosis
 in Japanese patients.",
