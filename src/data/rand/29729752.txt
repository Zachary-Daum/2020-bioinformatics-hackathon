    abstract "The coracoid process is the origin of the trapezoid ligament,
 the deltoid ligament, and the coracoacromial ligament (CAL). Detailed
 knowledge about their anatomy is crucial for surgical procedures such as the
 reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligaments or coracoid transfer.
 Although the coracoclavicular ligaments are considered important stabilizers
 of the acromioclavicular joint and are therefore highly protected, the CAL
 seems less important, which is why it is generally cut during coracoid
 transfer procedures. However, there is evidence that the CAL contributes to
 muscular balance and stabilization of the shoulder girdle. Therefore, an
 individual approach should be considered during coracoid transfer to save at
 least parts of the CAL.",
