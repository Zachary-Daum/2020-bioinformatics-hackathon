    abstract "BACKGROUND: Visual imagery plays a key role in health
 communication; however, there is little understanding of what aspects of
 vaccine-related images make them effective communication aids. Twitter, a
 popular venue for discussions related to vaccination, provides numerous
 images that are shared with tweets. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study
 were to understand how images are used in vaccine-related tweets and provide
 guidance with respect to the characteristics of vaccine-related images that
 correlate with the higher likelihood of being retweeted. METHODS: We
 collected more than one million vaccine image messages from Twitter and
 characterized various properties of these images using automated image
 analytics. We fit a logistic regression model to predict whether or not a
 vaccine image tweet was retweeted, thus identifying characteristics that
 correlate with a higher likelihood of being shared. For comparison, we built
 similar models for the sharing of vaccine news on Facebook and for general
 image tweets. RESULTS: Most vaccine-related images are duplicates
 (125,916/237,478; 53.02%) or taken from other sources, not necessarily
 created by the author of the tweet. Almost half of the images contain
 embedded text, and many include images of people and syringes. The visual
 content is highly correlated with a tweet's textual topics. Vaccine image
 tweets are twice as likely to be shared as nonimage tweets. The sentiment of
 an image and the objects shown in the image were the predictive factors in
 determining whether an image was retweeted. CONCLUSIONS: We are the first to
 study vaccine images on Twitter. Our findings suggest future directions for
 the study and use of vaccine imagery and may inform communication strategies
 around vaccination. Furthermore, our study demonstrates an effective study
 methodology for image analysis.",
