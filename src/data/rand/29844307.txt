    abstract "Although evidence has emerged to suggest that YAP overexpression
 is a crucial factor for tumor progression and resistance to targeted drugs in
 multiple cancers, the miRNA-mediated YAP regulation is still unclear. Here we
 show that the novel miR-550a-3-5p acts as a tumor suppressor and reverses
 BRAF inhibitor resistance through the direct targeting of YAP. Our data
 showed that the miR-550a-3-5p suppressed cell proliferation, metastasis, and
 tumor sphere formation through the direct inhibition of YAP and its oncogenic
 pathway in various cancer cell types. In addition, we showed that the YAP
 signature was associated with poor survival of colon cancer and identified an
 inverse correlation between miR-550a-3-5p and YAP in colon cancer tissues.
 Interestingly, this inverse correlation was regulated in a density-dependent
 manner. Furthermore, high levels of miR-550a-3-5p were associated with a good
 prognosis of esophageal cancer, which was suggestive of the clinical
 relevance of miR-550a-3-5p-mediated YAP regulation in multiple cancers.
 Importantly, we demonstrated that miR-550a-3-5p treatment sensitized
 vemurafenib-resistant colon and melanoma cells through YAP inhibition with
 reduced AKT activity. Moreover, the tumor-suppressive activity of
 miR-550a-3-5p and its sensitization effect for vemurafenib resistance were
 also observed in tumor xenograft models. Collectively, our data suggest that
 miR-550a-3-5p acts as a tumor suppressor through the targeting of oncogenic
 YAP and may be a new therapeutic tool for YAP-mediated BRAF inhibitor
 resistance in BRAF-mutant cancer cells.",
