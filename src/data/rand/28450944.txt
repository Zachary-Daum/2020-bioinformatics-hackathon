    abstract "The aim of the study was evaluate the 3.0 T magnetic resonance
 (MR) perfusion imaging scanning time window following contrast injection for
 differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions and to determine the
 optimum scanning time window for increased scanner usage efficiency and
 reduced diagnostic adverse risk factors. A total of 52 women with breast
 abnormalities were selected for conventional MR imaging and T1
 dynamic-enhanced imaging. Quantitative parameters [volume transfer constant
 (Ktrans), rate constant (Kep) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction
 (Ve)] were calculated at phases 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50, which represented time
 windows at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 min, respectively, following injection of
 contrast agent. The association of the parameters at different phases with
 benign and malignant tumor diagnosis was analyzed. MR perfusion imaging was
 verified as an effective modality in the diagnosis of breast malignancies and
 the best scanning time window was identified: i) Values of Ktrans and Kep at
 all phases were statistically significant in differentiating benign and
 malignant tumors (P<0.05), while the value of Ve had statistical significance
 only at stage 10, but not at any other stages (P>0.05); ii) values of Ve in
 benign tumors increased with phase number, but achieved no obvious changes at
 different phases in malignant tumors; iii) the optimum scanning time window
 of breast perfusion imaging with 3.0 T MR was between phases 10 and 30 (i.e.,
 between 5 and 15 min after contrast agent injection). The variation trend of
 Ve values at different phases may serve as a diagnostic reference for
 differentiating benign and malignant breast abnormalities. The most efficient
 scanning time window was indicated to be 5 min after contrast injection,
 based on the observation that the Ve value only had statistical significance
 in diagnosis at stage 10. However, the optimal scanning time window is from 5
 to 15 min following the injection of contrast agent, since that the variation
 trend of Ve is able to serve as a diagnostic reference.",
