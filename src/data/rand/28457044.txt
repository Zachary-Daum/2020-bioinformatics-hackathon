    abstract "Dermatomyositis and its association with malignancy is well
 known. Though many tumors like breast, ovary, lung carcinomas are reported to
 be associated with it, cervical carcinoma is a very rare one. Tumors in these
 patients are usually unmasked by abnormal findings in the medical history and
 physical examination. Here we report case of a postmenopausal female who
 presented with subacute onset of weakness of all four limbs. Treatment of the
 underlying tumor relieved the symptoms of dermatomyositis in our patient.",
