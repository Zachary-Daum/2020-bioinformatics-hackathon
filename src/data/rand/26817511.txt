    abstract "BACKGROUND: We detected the general level of knowledge about the
 early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subsequent care in general
 practitioners (GPs) from Southern Italy. We explored also the GP perception
 about their knowledge and training on diagnosis and management of AD.
 METHODS: On a sample of 131 GPs, we administered two questionnaires: the
 GP-Knowledge, evaluating GPs' expertise about AD epidemiology, differential
 diagnosis, and available treatments, and the GP-QUestionnaire on Awareness of
 Dementia (GP-QUAD), assessing the GPs' attitudes, awareness, and practice
 regarding early diagnosis of dementia. RESULTS: Specific screening tests or
 protocols to diagnose and manage dementia were not used by 53% of our GPs.
 The training on the recognition of early AD signs and symptoms was considered
 inadequate by 55% of the participants. Females were more likely to consider
 their training insufficient (58%) compared to males (53%). Female GPs were
 less likely to prescribe antipsychotic drugs to control neuropsychiatric
 symptoms (NPS) and suggest specialist advice in late stage of cognitive
 impairment. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) performed only on GP-QUAD
 suggested two dimensions explaining 26.1% (""GP attitude"") and 20.1% (""GP
 knowledge"") of the inertia for a total of 46.2%, CONCLUSION: In our survey
 on GP clinical practice, several problems in properly recognizing early AD
 symptoms and subsequently screening patients to be referred to
 secondary/tertiary care centers for diagnosis confirmation have emerged. In
 the future, specific training programs and educational projects for GPs
 should be implemented also in Italy to improve detection rates and management
 of dementia in primary care.",
