    abstract "BACKGROUND: The number of old people with breast cancer is
 estimated to increase during the next years in developed countries. However,
 management of breast cancer in octogenarians is not well established. The
 main objective was to evaluate if patients older than 80 years with breast
 cancer are receiving the most convenient treatment by using a population
 registry cancer analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a
 population cancer registry was designed. Data were retrieved from the
 Castellon Cancer Registry (Valencian Community, Spain). Patient records were
 analyzed from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2013. Two groups were defined:
 group A, <80 years; and group B, >= 80 years. Survival analyses were
 sequentially performed into three phases. First, a non-adjusted Kaplan Meier
 analysis was conducted. For the second survival analyses, Cox's proportional
 hazards model of Overall survival was used adjusting for condensed-TNM stage
 and adjuvant treatments. Finally, the third specific adjustment was carried
 out adding information of life expectancy by age for Spanish women,
 corresponding to year 2008 with condensed-TNM stage and Propensity Score
 variable, as an approximation to relative or disease-specific survival.
 RESULTS: The total number of included patients was 1304. Women >/=80 years
 presented a more extended disease, larger tumors and less in situ carcinomas.
 A lower proportion of women >/=80 years received adjuvant therapies. In the
 absence of any adjustment of results, the overall survival in women >/=80
 years was poorer than in younger patients (median of 14.1 years for <80y vs.
 5.7 years for >/=80y), the crude HR was 4.6 (95% CI: 2.9-7.5) p < 0.001. For
 second survival analysis, the HR was 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8-3.5) p < 0.001. After
 the third adjustment the HR was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.2-2.4) p = 0.004. CONCLUSIONS:
 Octogenarians with operable breast cancer are receiving suboptimal
 treatments, which can have repercussions on survival. New studies are
 required to identify a subgroup of women age >/=80 years who may benefit from
 more aggressive treatment and a population of older women on the basis of
 tumor characteristics, comorbidities and life expectancy who may not need as
 aggressive treatment.",
