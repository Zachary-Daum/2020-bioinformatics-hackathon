    abstract "BACKGROUND: Massive rotator cuff tears (MRCTs) represent a major
 clinical concern, especially when degeneration and chronicity are involved,
 which highly compromise healing capacity. PURPOSE: To study the effect of the
 secretome of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on tendon cells (TCs) followed by
 the combination of these activated TCs with an electrospun keratin-based
 scaffold to develop a tissue engineering strategy to improve tendon-bone
 interface (TBi) healing in a chronic MRCT rat model. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled
 laboratory study. METHODS: Human TCs (hTCs) cultured with the human MSCs
 (hMSCs) secretome (as conditioned media [CM]) were combined with keratin
 electrospun scaffolds and further implanted in a chronic MRCT rat model.
 Wistar-Han rats (N = 15) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: untreated
 lesion (MRCT group, n = 5), lesion treated with a scaffold only
 (scaffold-only group, n = 5), and lesion treated with a scaffold seeded with
 hTCs preconditioned with hMSCs-CM (STC_hMSC_CM group, n = 5). After
 sacrifice, 16 weeks after surgery, the rotator cuff TBi was harvested for
 histological analysis and biomechanical testing. RESULTS: The hMSCs secretome
 increased hTCs viability and density in vitro. In vivo, a significant
 improvement of the tendon maturing score was observed in the STC_hMSC_CM
 group (mean +/- standard error of the mean, 15.6 +/- 1.08) compared with the
 MRCT group (11.0 +/- 1.38; P < .05). Biomechanical tests revealed a
 significant increase in the total elongation to rupture (STC_hMSC_CM, 11.99
 +/- 3.30 mm; scaffold-only, 9.89 +/- 3.47 mm; MRCT, 5.86 +/- 3.16 mm; P <
 .05) as well as a lower stiffness (STC_hMSC_CM, 6.25 +/- 1.74 N/mm;
 scaffold-only, 6.72 +/- 1.28 N/mm; MRCT, 11.54 +/- 2.99 N/mm; P < .01).
 CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that hMSCs-CM increased hTCs viability
 and density in vitro. Clear benefits also were observed when these primed
 cells were integrated into a tissue engineering strategy with an electrospun
 keratin scaffold, as evidenced by improved histological and biomechanical
 properties for the STC_hMSC_CM group compared with the MRCT group. CLINICAL
 RELEVANCE: This work supports further investigation into the use of MSC
 secretome for priming TCs toward a more differentiated phenotype, and it
 promotes the tissue engineering strategy as a promising modality to help
 improve treatment outcomes for chronic MRCTs.",
