    abstract "Aims: Main pulmonary artery (MPA) stiffness and abnormal flow
 haemodynamics in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are strongly
 associated with elevated right ventricular (RV) afterload and associated with
 disease severity and poor clinical outcomes in adults with PAH. However, the
 long-term effects of MPA stiffness on RV function in children with PAH remain
 poorly understood. This study is the first comprehensive evaluation of MPA
 stiffness in children with PAH, delineating the mechanistic relationship
 between flow haemodynamics and MPA stiffness as well as the prognostic
 ability of these measures regarding clinical outcomes. Methods and results:
 Fifty-six children diagnosed with PAH underwent baseline cardiac magnetic
 resonance (CMR) acquisition and were compared with 23 control subjects. MPA
 stiffness and wall shear stress (WSS) were evaluated using phase contrast CMR
 and were evaluated for prognostic potential along with standard RV volumetric
 and functional indices. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was significantly increased
 (2.8 m/s vs. 1.4 m/s, P < 0.0001) and relative area change (RAC) was
 decreased (25% vs. 37%, P < 0.0001) in the PAH group, correlating with
 metrics of RV performance. Decreased WSS was associated with a decrease in
 RAC over time (r = 0.679, P < 0.001). For each unit increase in PWV, there
 was approximately a 3.2-fold increase in having a moderate clinical event.
 Conclusion: MPA stiffness assessed by non-invasive CMR was increased in
 children with PAH and correlated with RV performance, suggesting that MPA
 stiffness is a major contribution to RV dysfunction. PWV is predictive of
 moderate clinical outcomes, and may be a useful prognostic marker of disease
 activity in children with PAH.",
