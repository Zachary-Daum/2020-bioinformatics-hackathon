    abstract "Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is
 differentially associated with cell proliferation and extracellular matrix
 (ECM) assembly. We show here the effect of exogenous SPARC
 inhibition/induction on ECM and mitochondrial proteins expression and on the
 differentiation of C2C12 cells. The cells were cultured in growth medium (GM)
 supplemented with different experimental conditions. The differentiation of
 myoblasts was studied for 5 days, the expressions of ECM and mitochondrial
 proteins were measured and the formation of the myotubes was quantified after
 exogenous induction/inhibition of SPARC. The results indicate that the
 addition of recombinant SPARC protein (rSPARC) in cell culture medium
 increased the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and myogenin expression
 during the myotube formation. However, the treatment with antibody specific
 for SPARC (anti-SPARC) prevented the differentiation and decreased myogenin
 expression. The induction of SPARC in the proliferating and differentiating
 C2C12 cells increased collagen 1a1 protein expression, whereas the inhibition
 decreased it. The effects on fibronectin protein expression were opposite.
 Furthermore, the addition of rSPARC in C2C12 myoblast increased the
 expression of mitochondrial proteins, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core
 protein II (UQCRC2) and succinate dehydrogenase iron-sulfur subunit (SDHB),
 whereas the anti-SPARC decreased them. During the differentiation, only the
 anti-SPARC had the effects on mitochondrial proteins, NADH dehydrogenase
 ubiquinone 1 beta subcomplex subunit 8 (NADHB8), SDHB and cytochrome c
 oxidase 1 (MTCO1). Thus, SPARC plays a crucial role in the proliferation and
 differentiation of C2C12 and may be involved in the link between the ECM
 remodeling and mitochondrial function.",
