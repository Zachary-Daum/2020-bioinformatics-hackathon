    abstract "Objectives: The aim of this paper was to compare failure
 differences in precious metal customized lingual brackets bonded with three
 adhesive systems. Also, differences in failure of non-precious metal brackets
 with and without a silicatized base layer bonded with the same adhesive, as
 well as the influence of enamel etching prior to using a self-etching dual
 cure resin were explored. Materials/methods: Five different groups were
 defined in a semi-randomized approach. Group 1 (IME): Maxcem Elite with 378
 Incognito brackets and etched teeth, Group 2 (IMNE): Maxcem Elite with 193
 Incognito brackets on non-etched teeth, Group 3 (INE): Nexus+Excite with 385
 Incognito brackets, Group 4 (IRE): Relyx with 162 Incognito brackets, Group 5
 (HRME) and Group 6 (HNRME): Maxcem Elite with 182 Harmony brackets with
 silicatized and non-slicatized bases respectively. Bracket failures were
 recorded over a 12-month period. Results: The number of failures during the
 observation period was small in the various adhesives types of groups, as
 well as in HRME and HNRME groups, and the comparisons among those groups were
 non-significant (P > 0.05). A statistically significant difference (P < 0.05)
 was found between the IME and IMNE groups. Conclusions: 1. During the first
 year of treatment customized lingual brackets failure frequencies (rates) are
 not different for the three adhesive materials tested. 2. Eliminating the
 etching stage when using self-etch/self-adhesive adhesives, may lead to a
 dramatic increase in the failure rates. 3. Silicoating of stainless steel
 customized lingual brackets does not seem to influence the failure of the
 bonds.",
