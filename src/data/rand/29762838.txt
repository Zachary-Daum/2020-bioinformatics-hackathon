    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Glioma is a tumor of the brain. Although the clinical
 regimens and surgical techniques for glioma have improved, therapies of
 advanced glioma remain challenging, carrying dismal overall survival and
 therapeutic success rates. Evidence has shown that miRNAs played important
 roles in glioma development. The current study aimed at investigating the
 function of a novel cancerogenic miRNA, miR-93, in glioma progression by
 investigating the expression and mechanism of it. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
 qRT-PCR was conducted to assess the miR-93 expression and the mRNA expression
 of target gene in glioma tissues and cells. The invasion and migration
 abilities of the glioma cells were determined by transwell assays. Luciferase
 reporter assay was performed to confirm the target of miR-93. RESULTS: The
 results indicated that miR-93 expression in glioma tissues and cells was
 increased significantly than that in normal brain tissues and cells.
 Furthermore, miR-93 promoted glioma cell migration and invasion. RBL2 was
 recognized as a direct target of miR-93 in glioma cells, and overexpression
 of RBL2 could reverse the stimulative effect of miR-93 in glioma cell.
 CONCLUSIONS: The above findings suggested that miR-93 together with RBL2
 could be diagnostic targets and novel prognostic markers for glioma.",
