    abstract "A study of the bat diversity was conducted in Hulu Terengganu
 dipterocarp forest and Setiu Wetland Beach Ridges Interspersed with Swales
 (BRIS) forest in Terengganu, to study the species diversity, composition and
 stratification of fruit bats from the understorey to the forest canopy. Mist
 nets were set up at the understorey, sub-canopy and canopy layer while harp
 traps were set up at the understorey layer. We recorded 170 individuals from
 six families' compromised 21 species from Hulu Terengganu dipterocarp forests
 and four species from Setiu Wetland BRIS forests throughout the sampling
 period. Megaerops ecaudatus and Cynopterus brachyotis were the most dominant
 species in Hulu Terengganu dipterocarp forest and Setiu Wetland BRIS forests.
 Our study also recorded two species with new distributional records for the
 east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, namely, Rhinolophus chiewkweeae and
 Chaerephon johorensis in Hulu Terengganu dipterocarp forests. Potential
 factors that might influence the results were in terms of the canopy covers,
 the structural complexity of canopy, food availability and spatial
 characteristics. This study was able to increase the knowledge on the species
 diversity and composition of bats in Hulu Terengganu dipterocarp forest and
 Setiu Wetland BRIS forest, thus, further aid in the effort of bat
 conservation in both areas.",
