    abstract "PURPOSE: Icodextrin can enhance ultrafiltration and consequently
 improve fluid balance and can control blood pressure and reduce left
 ventricular mass for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. This study
 investigated whether icodextrin use could reduce the risk of congestive heart
 failure (CHF) for PD patients. METHODS: From the Taiwan National Health
 Insurance database, we identified 5462 newly diagnosed end-stage renal
 disease patients undergoing PD from 2005 to 2010. Incidence rates and hazard
 ratio of CHF were estimated for patients with and without icodextrin
 treatment by the end of 2011. RESULTS: Among PD patients, icodextrin users
 had an overall 26% lower incidence of CHF than non-users (13.7 vs 18.6 per
 1000 person-years). Relatively, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.67 (95% CI =
 0.52-0.87) for users compared with non-users. Among PD patients with
 diabetes, the incident CHF in icodextrin users was 37.5% lower than that in
 non-users (17.8 vs 28.5 per 1000 person-years). Among PD patients without
 diabetes, the incident CHF in icodextrin users was 30.4% lower than that in
 non-users (11.0 vs 15.8 per 1000 person-years). CONCLUSIONS: Icodextrin
 solution could reduce the risk of new-onset CHF, particularly effective when
 diabetic PD patients use it.",
