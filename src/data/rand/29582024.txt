    abstract "Cartilage is composed of cells and an extracellular matrix, the
 latter being a composite of a collagen mesh interpenetrated by proteoglycans
 responsible for tissue osmotic swelling. The matrix composition and structure
 vary through the tissue depth. Mapping such variability requires tissue
 sectioning to gain access. The resulting surface roughness, and concomitant
 proteoglycan loss contribute to large uncertainties in elastic modulus
 estimates. To extract elasticity values for the bulk matrix which are not
 obfuscated by the indeterminate surface layer, we developed a novel
 experimental and data analysis methodology. We analyzed the surface roughness
 to optimize the probe size, and performed high-resolution (1 mum) elasticity
 mapping on thin ( approximately 12 mum), epiphyseal newborn mouse cartilage
 sections cut parallel to the bone longitudinal axis or normal to the
 articular surface. Mild fixation prevented the major proteoglycan loss
 observed in unfixed specimens but not the stress release that resulted in
 thickness changes in the sectioned matrix. Our novel data analysis method
 introduces a virtual contact point as a fitting parameter for the Hertz
 model, to minimize the effects of surface roughness and corrects for the
 finite section thickness. Our estimates of cartilage elasticity converge with
 increasing indentation depth and, unlike previous data interpretations, are
 consistent with linearly elastic material. A high cell density that leaves
 narrow matrix septa between cells may cause the underestimation of elastic
 moduli, whereas fixation probably causes an overestimation. The proposed
 methodology has broader relevance to nano- and micro-indentation of soft
 materials with multiple length scales of organization and whenever surface
 effects (including roughness, electrostatics, van der Waals forces, etc.)
 become significant.",
