    abstract "Treatment outcomes from pallidal deep brain stimulation are
 highly heterogeneous reflecting the phenotypic and etiologic spectrum of
 dystonia. Treatment stratification to neurostimulation therapy primarily
 relies on the phenotypic motor presentation; however, etiology including
 genetic factors are increasingly recognized as modifiers of treatment
 outcomes. Here, we describe a 53 year-old female patient with a progressive
 generalized dystonia since age 25. The patient underwent deep brain
 stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi-DBS) at age 44. Since the
 clinical phenotype included mobile choreo-dystonic features, we expected
 favorable therapeutic outcome from GPi-DBS. Although mobile dystonia
 components were slightly improved in the long-term outcome from GPi-DBS the
 overall therapeutic response 9 years from implantation was limited when
 comparing ""stimulation off"" and ""stimulation on"" despite of proper
 electrode localization and sufficient stimulation programming. In order to
 further understand the reason for this limited motor symptom response, we
 aimed to clarify the etiology of generalized dystonia in this patient.
 Genetic testing identified a novel heterozygous pathogenic SLC2A1 mutation as
 cause of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS). This case
 report presents the first outcome of GPi-DBS in a patient with GLUT1-DS, and
 suggests that genotype relations may increasingly complement phenotype-based
 therapy stratification of GPi-DBS in dystonia.",
