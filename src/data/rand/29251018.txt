    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors
 (the 'gliflozins') promote the excretion of glucose from the kidney to lower
 HbA1c. Empagliflozin was the first gliflozin shown to improve cardiovascular
 and renal outcomes in subjects with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
 disease. Areas covered: In the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study
 (CANVAS) Program, there were improvements in the primary cardiovascular and
 exploratory renal outcomes with canagliflozin, compared to placebo. The
 safety outcome finding, which was of most interest, was that there was a
 higher risk of amputation of toes, feet, or legs with canagliflozin than in
 the placebo group. This program is the subject of this evaluation. Expert
 opinion: As canagliflozin has small beneficial effects in the treatment of
 type 2 diabetes in subjects with cardiovascular disease, it is not on the
 canvas. However, there are still several questions about canagliflozin that
 need to be answered before it is widely used, especially in comparison with
 other gliflozins; As amputations have only been reported with canagliflozin
 in CANVAS, should other gliflozins be preferred? As canagliflozin has not
 been shown to be beneficial in subjects not taking diuretics, should other
 gliflozins be preferred in this population? Clarification is also needed as
 to whether canagliflozin increases the risk of non-fatal stroke, or not.",
