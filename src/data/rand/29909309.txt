    abstract "Microplastics (MPs) sized between 0.33 and 5mm were collected
 using Manta trawls from ten surface seawater sites in Bohai and Huanghai
 Seas, China. A total of 1024 (Bohai Sea) and 132 (Huanghai Sea) microplastic
 pieces were classified, including polystyrene foams, polyethylene films and
 lines, and other plastic pellets, with concentrations of MPs ranging from 3
 to 162 particles per 100m(3) (0.012-2.96mgm(-3)). A pretreatment of MPs with
 30% H2O2 in water did not significantly lower polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
 (PAH) concentrations on MPs compared to no H2O2 pretreatment. Measurements of
 PAHs carried on the collected MPs indicated that the concentrations of the
 sum of 16 PAHs were in the range of 3400-119,000ngg(-1). The sources of PAHs
 in Bohai and Huanghai Seas were highly similar, with petroleum and gasoline
 probably as the dominant sources. The present study shows the relative
 importance of MPs in regards to chemical transport in the marine environment.
 The combination of high concentrations of PAHs affiliated with MPs and the
 increasing magnitude of plastic pollution in the world's oceans demonstrates
 the considerable importance of MPs to the fate of PAHs in marine environments.",
