    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) can be difficult to
 diagnose. We aimed to evaluate whether a gene expression score could
 differentiate adult EoE cases from non-EoE controls and to determine whether
 scores normalized after treatment for EoE. METHODS: We analyzed prospectively
 collected esophageal biopsies from EoE patients (diagnosed as per consensus
 guidelines and after a proton pump inhibitor trial) and non-EoE controls.
 Gene expression for a previously constructed 94 gene panel was quantified for
 a single RNA-later preserved biopsy. For diagnosis, a summary expression
 score and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)
 were calculated. For treatment response (defined as <15 eosinophils per
 high-power field), pretreatment and posttreatment EoE samples were compared.
 RESULTS: For 91 EoE cases and 174 controls, gene scores for EoE cases were
 lower than non-EoE controls (mean 198 vs. 420; P<0.001), with an AUC of
 0.927. A score </=263 yielded a positive predictive value=91%; a score >/=349
 yielded a negative predictive value=90%; only 12% of subjects had an
 indeterminate score (264-348) by this classification scheme. For the 89 EoE
 cases with paired pretreatment and posttreatment samples, overall gene scores
 improved after treatment from 199 to 343 (P<0.001). This normalization was
 seen only in cases with histological response (202 vs. 425; P<0.001); scores
 were unchanged in non-responders (189 vs. 226; P=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: A gene
 expression score has high diagnostic utility for distinguishing EoE patients
 from non-EoE controls in adults and can be used in clinical algorithms.
 Because it is highly responsive to treatment, the test could be used to
 monitor disease status.",
