    abstract "We report the first examples of ruthenium complexes
 cis-[(N4)Ru(III)Cl2](+) and cis-[(N4)Ru(II)(OH2)2](2+) supported by chiral
 tetradentate amine ligands (N4), together with a high-valent cis-dioxo
 complex cis-[(N4)Ru(VI)(O)2](2+) supported by the chiral N4 ligand mcp (mcp =
 N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)cyclohexane-1,2-diamine). The X-ray
 crystal structures of cis-[(mcp)Ru(III)Cl2](ClO4) (1a),
 cis-[(Me2mcp)Ru(III)Cl2]ClO4 (2a) and cis-[(pdp)Ru(III)Cl2](ClO4) (3a)
 (Me2mcp = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N
'-bis((6-methylpyridin-2-yl)methyl)cyclohexane-1,2-diamine, pdp = 1,1
'-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-2,2'-bipyrrolidine)) show that the ligands
 coordinate to the ruthenium centre in a cis-alpha configuration. In aqueous
 solutions, proton-coupled electron-transfer redox couples were observed for
 cis-[(mcp)Ru(III)(O2CCF3)2]ClO4 (1b) and cis-[(pdp)Ru(III)(O3SCF3)2]CF3SO3
 (3c'). Electrochemical analyses showed that the chemically/electrochemically
 generated cis-[(mcp)Ru(VI)(O)2](2+) and cis-[(pdp)Ru(VI)(O)2](2+) complexes
 are strong oxidants with E degrees  = 1.11-1.13 V vs. SCE (at pH 1) and
 strong H-atom abstractors with DO-H = 90.1-90.8 kcal mol(-1). The reaction of
 1b or its (R,R)-mcp counterpart with excess (NH4)2[Ce(IV)(NO3)6] (CAN) in
 aqueous medium afforded cis-[(mcp)Ru(VI)(O)2](ClO4)2 (1e) or
 cis-[((R,R)-mcp)Ru(VI)(O)2](ClO4)2 (1e*), respectively, a strong oxidant with
 E(Ru(VI/V)) = 0.78 V (vs. Ag/AgNO3) in acetonitrile solution. Complex 1e
 oxidized various hydrocarbons, including cyclohexane, in acetonitrile at room
 temperature, affording alcohols and/or ketones in up to 66% yield.
 Stoichiometric oxidations of alkenes by 1e or 1e* in (t) BuOH/H2O (5 : 1 v/v)
 afforded diols and aldehydes in combined yields of up to 98%, with moderate
 enantioselectivity obtained for the reaction using 1e*. The
 cis-[(pdp)Ru(II)(OH2)2](2+) (3c)-catalysed oxidation of saturated C-H bonds,
 including those of ethane and propane, with CAN as terminal oxidant was also
 demonstrated.",
