    abstract "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Novel strategies to stimulate the expansion of
 beta cell mass in situ are warranted for diabetes therapy. The aim of this
 study was to elucidate the secretome of human bone marrow (BM)-derived
 multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) with documented islet regenerative paracrine
 function. We hypothesised that regenerative MSCs will secrete a unique
 combination of protein factors that augment islet regeneration. METHODS:
 Human BM-derived MSCs were examined for glucose-lowering capacity after
 transplantation into streptozotocin-treated NOD/severe combined
 immunodeficiency (SCID) mice and segregated into samples with regenerative
 (MSC(R)) vs nonregenerative (MSC(NR)) capacity. Secreted proteins associated
 with islet regenerative function were identified using stable isotope
 labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative
 proteomics. To functionally validate the importance of active Wnt signalling,
 we stimulated the Wnt-signalling pathway in MSC(NR) samples during ex vivo
 expansion using glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibition (CHIR99201), and
 the conditioned culture media (CM) generated was tested for the capacity to
 support cultured human islet cell survival and proliferation in vitro.
 RESULTS: MSC(R) showed increased secretion of proteins associated with cell
 growth, matrix remodelling, immunosuppressive and proangiogenic properties.
 In contrast, MSC(NR) uniquely secreted proteins known to promote inflammation
 and negatively regulate angiogenesis. Most notably, MSC(R) maintained Wnt
 signalling via Wnt5A/B (~2.5-fold increase) autocrine activity during ex vivo
 culture, while MSC(NR) repressed Wnt signalling via Dickkopf-related protein
 (DKK)1 (~2.5-fold increase) and DKK3 secretion. Inhibition of GSK3 activity
 in MSC(NR) samples increased the accumulation of nuclear beta-catenin and
 generated CM that augmented beta cell survival (13% increases) and
 proliferation when exposed to cultured human islets.
 CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Maintenance of active Wnt signalling within human
 MSCs promotes the secretion of matricellular and proangiogenic proteins that
 formulate a niche for islet regeneration.",
