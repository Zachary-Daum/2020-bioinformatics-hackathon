    abstract "The plant cell wall responds dynamically during interaction with
 various pathogens. Upon recognition of ""nonself"" components, plant cells
 deploy a variety of immune responses including cell wall fortification.
 Callose, a beta-(1, 3)-D-glucan polymer, is a component of the material
 deposited at the site of infection between the plasma membrane and the
 preexisting cell wall that is hypothesized to serve as a physical barrier and
 platform for directed antimicrobial compound deposition. The
 defense-associated function of callose deposition is supported by its
 induction during pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-triggered
 immunity (PTI) and its inhibition by defense suppressing virulence effectors.
 Thus, callose deposition is a commonly monitored read-out in plant defense.
 This protocol describes the use of aniline blue staining and fluorescent
 microscopy to measure callose deposition in bacteria-infected or
 elicitor-challenged Arabidopsis leaf tissues.",
