    abstract "Background: Alpha-synuclein is a constituent of Lewy bodies and
 mutations of its gene cause familial Parkinson's disease (PD). A previous
 study showed that a variant of the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA), namely the
 263 bp allele of Rep1 was associated with faster motor progression in PD. On
 the contrary, a recent report failed to detect a detrimental effect of Rep1
 263 on both motor and cognitive outcomes in PD. Aim of this study was to
 evaluate the influence of the Rep1 variants on disease progression in PD
 patients. Methods: We recruited and genotyped for SNCA Rep1 426 PD patients
 with age at onset >/=40 years and disease duration >/=4 years. We then
 analyzed frequency and time of occurrence of wearing-off, dyskinesia,
 freezing of gait, visual hallucinations, and dementia using a multivariate
 Cox's proportional hazards regression model. Results: SNCA Rep1 263 carriers
 showed significantly increased risk of both dementia (HR = 3.03) and visual
 hallucinations (HR = 2.69) compared to 263 non-carriers. Risk of motor
 complications did not differ in the two groups. Conclusion: SNCA Rep1 263
 allele is associated with a worse cognitive outcome in PD.",
