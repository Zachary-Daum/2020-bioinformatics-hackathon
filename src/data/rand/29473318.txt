    abstract """Warm water lactococcosis"" in farm-reared rainbow trout,
 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) in the northern Himalayan region of India,
 caused by bacterium Lactococcus garvieae is described in this study. Nine
 bacterial isolates were recovered from the organs of haemorrhagic septicaemia
 rainbow trout and were subjected to biochemical and molecular identification.
 Cell surface characteristics and virulence of the bacterial isolates are also
 described. All the nine bacterial isolates had homogenous biochemical
 characteristics and were Gram-positive, short chains forming (two to eight
 cells long), alpha-haemolytic, non-motile ovoid cocci. Partial 16S rDNA
 nucleotide sequence (~1,400 bp) of current isolates shared 99% identities
 with the 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence of L. garvieae R421, L. garvieae FMA395
 and L. garvieae CAU:1730. The identity of the bacterial isolates was further
 confirmed by PCR amplification of L. garvieae-specific ~1,100 bp fragment.
 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of one representative isolate, L.
 garvieae RTCLI04, indicates that the isolated strain lacks thick outer
 capsule and is of KG+ (non-capsulates) phenotype. An intraperitoneal and
 intramuscular injection (2.6 x 10(5) CFU ml(-1) ) and also immersion in
 bacterial suspension @ of 2.6 x 10(5) CFU ml(-1) to healthy rainbow trout
 juveniles (body weight: 27.5 +/- 3.7 g) with L. garvieae RTCLI04 caused 80%,
 60% and 10% cumulative mortality in challenged fish, respectively, within 15
 days post-infection. The haemorrhagic septicaemic disease was reproduced
 experimentally. Histopathological examination of organs of experimentally
 infected fish revealed extensive degenerative and inflammatory changes in
 eye, kidney, gill and liver. PCR amplification of several putative virulence
 genes such as haemolysins, adhesins, LPxTG-containing surface proteins and
 adhesins cluster confirms the virulence of our Indian L. garvieae isolates.
 To the best of our knowledge, we are reporting for the first time that L.
 garvieae is associated with fatal haemorrhagic septicaemia in farmed rainbow
 trout in India.",
