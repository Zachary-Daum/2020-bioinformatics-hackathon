    abstract "After a raindrop impacts on a granular bed, a crater is formed
 as both drop and target deform. After an initial, transient, phase in which
 the maximum crater depth is reached, the crater broadens outwards until a
 final steady shape is attained. By varying the impact velocity of the drop
 and the packing density of the bed, we find that avalanches of grains are
 important in the second phase and hence affect the final crater shape. In a
 previous paper, we introduced an estimate of the impact energy going solely
 into sand deformation and here we show that both the transient and final
 crater diameter collapse with this quantity for various packing densities.
 The aspect ratio of the transient crater is however altered by changes in the
 packing fraction.",
