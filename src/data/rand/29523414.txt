    abstract "BACKGROUND: Testing hypotheses regarding the role of
 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction in schizophrenia requires
 understanding the mechanisms of NMDAR regulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC)
 circuit function. NMDAR antagonists are thought to produce pyramidal cell
 (PC) disinhibition. However, inhibitory parvalbumin-positive basket cells
 (PVBCs) have modest NMDAR-mediated excitatory drive and thus are unlikely to
 participate in NMDAR antagonist-mediated disinhibition. Interestingly, recent
 studies demonstrated that presynaptic NMDARs enhance transmitter release at
 central synapses. Thus, if presynaptic NMDARs enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid
 release at PVBC-to-PC synapses, they could participate in NMDAR-dependent PC
 disinhibition. Here, we examined whether presynaptic NMDAR effects could
 modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid release at PVBC-to-PC synapses in mouse PFC.
 METHODS: Using whole-cell recordings from synaptically connected pairs in
 mouse PFC, we determined whether NMDA or NMDAR antagonist application affects
 PVBC-to-PC inhibition in a manner consistent with a presynaptic mechanism.
 RESULTS: NMDAR activation enhanced by  approximately 40% the synaptic current
 at PVBC-to-PC pairs. This effect was consistent with a presynaptic mechanism
 given that it was 1) observed with postsynaptic NMDARs blocked by
 intracellular MK801, 2) associated with a lower rate of transmission failures
 and a higher transmitter release probability, and 3) blocked by intracellular
 MK801 in the PVBC. NMDAR antagonist application did not affect the synaptic
 currents in PVBC-to-PC pairs, but it reduced the inhibitory currents elicited
 in PCs with simultaneous glutamate release by extracellular stimulation.
 CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that NMDAR activation enhances PVBC-to-PC
 inhibition in a manner consistent with presynaptic mechanisms, and we suggest
 that the functional impact of this presynaptic effect depends on the activity
 state of the PFC network.",
