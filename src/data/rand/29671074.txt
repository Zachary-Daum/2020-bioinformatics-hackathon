    abstract "PURPOSE: The force that has to be exerted on the plunger for
 administering a given amount of fluid in a given time, has an important
 influence on comfort for the subject and usability for the administrator in
 intradermal drug delivery. The purpose of this study is to model those forces
 that are subject-independent, by linking needle and syringe geometry to the
 force required for ejecting a given fluid at a given ejection rate. MATERIAL
 AND METHODS: We extend the well-known Hagen-Poiseuille formula to predict
 pressure drop induced by a fluid passing through a cylindrical body. The
 model investigates the relation between the pressure drop in needles and the
 theoretic Hagen-Poiseuille prediction and is validated in fifteen needles
 from 26G up to 33G suited for intradermal drug delivery. We also provide a
 method to assess forces exerted by operators in real world conditions.
 RESULTS: The model is highly linear in each individual needle with R-square
 values ranging from 75% up to 99.9%. Ten out of fifteen needles exhibit
 R-square values above 99%. A proof-of-concept for force assessment is
 provided by logging forces in operators in real life conditions. CONCLUSIONS:
 The force assessment method and the model can be used to pinpoint needle
 geometry for intradermal injection devices, tuning comfort for subjects and
 usability for operators.",
