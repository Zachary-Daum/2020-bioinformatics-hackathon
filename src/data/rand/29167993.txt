    abstract "Glycogen storage disease (GSD) 0a is a rare congenital metabolic
 disease with symptoms in infancy and childhood caused by biallelic GYS2
 germline variants. A predisposition to cancer has not been described yet. We
 report here a boy with GSD 0a, who developed a malignant brain tumor at the
 age of 4.5 years. The tumor was classified as a group 3 medulloblastoma, and
 the patient died from cancer 27 months after initial tumor diagnosis. This
 case appears interesting as group 3 medulloblastoma is so far not known to
 arise in hereditary syndromes and the biology of sporadic group 3
 medulloblastoma is largely unknown.",
