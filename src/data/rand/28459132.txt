    abstract "This study describes the dentoalveolar and palatal growth during
 the first months of life. Knowledge concerning this development is essential
 to avoid unwanted events such as mucosal ulcerations or restriction of growth
 when cleft-lip and palate (CLP) patients are treated. The results involve the
 generation of CAD/CAM CLP-feeding plates. Intraoral impressions from 32
 healthy newborns were taken monthly for 5 months, supplemented by
 measurements of body weight, length, and occipital-frontal head
 circumference. The casts were digitalized, and two observers manually
 selected defined anatomical landmarks on virtual 3-D models. The distances
 between these landmarks were evaluted. Statistical analysis included an
 inter-rater agreement analysis and the determination of growth. In total, 213
 casts were analyzed, with 65 models excluded because of inaccuracies in
 impression-taking or cast production. Overall longitudinal growth was 20.3%,
 whereas transversal growth reached a maximum of 21.1%. Vertical growth was
 32.4% at the tuberal level. On the basis of these results, a semiautomated
 series of feeding plates allowing for monthly expansion could be generated.
 The acquired data serve as a useful reference for other pediatric and
 orthofacial investigations and treatments. One such application is the
 automated, fully virtual manufacture of CLP-feeding plates based on only one
 impression-taking. Our data reveal when caution is needed to prevent
 ulceration. The series of plates generated can minimize the time-consuming
 impression-taking and the production of further plaster models. The method of
 measurement is suitable for documentary purposes. Clin. Anat. 30:846-854,
