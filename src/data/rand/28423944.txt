    abstract "Spectacular progress in high-throughput transcriptome sequencing
 and expression profiling using next-generation sequencing technologies have
 recently revolutionized molecular biology and allowed massive advances in
 identifying the genomic regions and molecular mechanisms underlying
 transcriptional regulation of growth, development, and stress response.
 Through recent research, non-coding RNAs, in particular long non-coding RNAs,
 have emerged as key regulators of transcription in eukaryotes. Long
 non-coding RNAs are vastly heterogeneous groups of RNAs that execute a broad
 range of essential roles in various biological processes at the epigenetic,
 transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels. They modulate transcription
 through diverse mechanisms. Recently, numerous lncRNAs have been identified
 to be associated with defense responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. These
 have been suggested to perform indispensable roles in plant immunity and
 adaptation to environmental conditions. However, only a few lncRNAs have been
 functionally characterized in plants. In this paper, we summarize the present
 knowledge of lncRNAs, review the recent advances in understanding regulatory
 functions of lncRNAs, and highlight the emerging roles of lncRNAs in
 regulating immune responses in plants.",
