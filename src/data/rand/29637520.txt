    abstract "PURPOSE: Obligatory exercise is characterized by continued
 exercise despite negative consequences, and intense negative affect when
 unable to exercise. Research suggests psychosocial differences between
 individuals that exercise in an obligatory manner and those that do not. It
 also has been speculated that obligatory exercise may serve coping and affect
 regulation functions, yet these factors have not been routinely examined in
 community women with poor body image. The purpose of the current study was to
 investigate psychosocial differences between obligatory and non-obligatory
 exercisers, and to examine the use of obligatory exercise as an avoidant
 coping strategy in a sample of women with poor body image. METHODS: Women (n
 = 70) seeking treatment for body dissatisfaction were divided into obligatory
 and non-obligatory exercise groups based on their scores on the Obligatory
 Exercise Questionnaire. Participants then completed an assessment battery
 about eating pathology, body image, reasons for exercise, coping strategies,
 and negative affect. RESULTS: Independent t test analyses indicated that
 obligatory exercisers had significantly greater eating disorder
 symptomatology, avoidant coping, and appearance- and mood-related reasons for
 exercise than non-obligatory exercisers. Multiple regression analyses
 revealed that eating disorder symptomatology and avoidant coping were
 significant predictors of obligatory exercise. CONCLUSIONS: There are
 distinct psychosocial differences between women with poor body image who
 exercise in an obligatory fashion and those who do not. The current study
 suggests that obligatory exercise may serve as an avoidant coping strategy
 for women with poor body image. Enhancing healthy coping strategies may be an
 important addition to body image improvement programs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V,
