    abstract "Lignocellulosic biomass can be a significant source of renewable
 clean energy with continued improvement in biomass yield and bioconversion
 strategies. In higher plants, the leaf blade is the central energy convertor
 where solar energy and CO2 are assimilated to make the building blocks for
 biomass production. Here we report that introducing the leaf blade
 development regulator STENOFOLIA (STF), a WOX family transcription factor,
 into the biofuel crop switchgrass, significantly improves both biomass yield
 and sugar release. We found that STF overexpressing switchgrass plants
 produced approximately 2-fold more dry biomass and release approximately
 1.8-fold more solubilized sugars without pretreatment compared to controls.
 The biomass increase was attributed mainly to increased leaf width and stem
 thickness, which was also consistent in STF transgenic rice and Brachypodium,
 and appeared to be caused by enhanced cell proliferation. STF directly binds
 to multiple regions in the promoters of some cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase
 (CKX) genes and represses their expression in all three transgenic grasses.
 This repression was accompanied by a significant increase in active cytokinin
 content in transgenic rice leaves, suggesting that the increase in biomass
 productivity and sugar release could at least in part be associated with
 improved cytokinin levels caused by repression of cytokinin degrading
 enzymes. Our study provides a new tool for improving biomass feedstock yield
 in bioenergy crops, and uncovers a novel mechanistic insight in the function
 of STF, which may also apply to other repressive WOX genes that are master
 regulators of several key plant developmental programs.",
