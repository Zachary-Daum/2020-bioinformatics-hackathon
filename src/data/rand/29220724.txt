    abstract "Ethanamizuril is a new triazine compound that displays potent
 anticoccidial activity against chicken coccidiosis caused by Eimeria tenella.
 We studied the pharmacokinetics of ethanamizuril in rats and chickens after
 single oral doses of one, two and three times the minimum effective dose
 Ethanamizuril was readily absorbed at all three doses and the plasma
 concentration reached was maximal within 5h and progressively declined over
 time. The mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the
 concentration-time curve (AUC) were both dose-dependent. These results
 provide pharmacokinetic profiles of ethanamizuril for future preclinical
 studies and clinical use.",
