    abstract "The persistence of operant responding in the context of
 distractors and opposing forces is of central importance to the success of
 behavioral interventions. It has been successfully analyzed with Behavioral
 Momentum Theory. Key data from the research inspired by that theory are
 reanalyzed in terms of more molecular behavioral mechanisms: the
 demotivational effects of disruptors, and their differential impacts on the
 target response and other responses that interact with them. Behavioral
 momentum is regrounded as a nonlinear effect of motivation and reinforcement
 rate on response probability and persistence. When response probabilities are
 high, more energy is required to further increase or to decrease them than
 when they are low. Classic Behavioral Momentum Theory effects are reproduced
 with this account. Finally, it is shown how the new account involving
 motivation and competition is closely related to the metaphor of force and
 action that is at the core of Behavioral Momentum Theory.",
