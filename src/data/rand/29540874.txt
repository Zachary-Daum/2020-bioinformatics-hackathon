    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To find the association of Empathy, Self-Efficacy,
 and/or Hope with readiness for lifelong learning among medical students.
 METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in 2016 at Ras
 Al-Khaimah Medical and Health Sciences University in the United Arab
 Emirates, and comprised medical students from all five years. A
 self-reporting questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data
 .Standard scales and analysis of variance test were used to compare the mean
 scores of different variables for different groups.. RESULTS: Of the 221
 students 146(66%) were females, and the overall mean age was 19.94+/-1.71
 years. The mean score of Inter-professional Reactivity Index to measure
 Empathy was 67.3+/-12.54. For self-efficacy it was 34.1+/-9.01. The mean
 score of Academic Hope Scale was 28.92+/-5.54. The mean score of the Revised
 Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning was 40.76+/-6.8. Female
 students had significantly higher scores of Inter-professional Reactivity
 Index and self-efficacy, whereas, non-Arab students had higher
 Inter-professional Reactivity Index scores than Arab students (p<0.05 each).
 Self-efficacy, hope, and lifelong learning were significantly and positively
 correlated (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Improving the positive psychology of
 medical students may increase their readiness to lifelong learning.",
