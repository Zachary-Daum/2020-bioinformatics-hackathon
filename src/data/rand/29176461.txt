    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of hydroxyurea (HU) on
 nutritional status and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) of children with
 sickle cell disease (SCD). DESIGN: Anthropometry and serum 25-OHD were
 determined in 98 children with SCD, comprising of 68 in HU-group and 30 in
 HU-naive group. RESULTS: Underweight was more common among HU-naive group
 (33.3% vs. 10.3%, P=0.009), while 79.4% of HU-group against 56.7% HU-naive
 had normal body mass index percentile for age and sex, P=0.028. None of the
 HU-group compared with 13.3% of the HU-naive had severe vitamin D deficiency,
 P=0.002. The mean 25-OHD of the HU-group was also higher (24.1+/-1.2 vs.
 19.1+/-9.8 ng/mL, P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: HU possibly ameliorate growth
 retardation and vitamin D deficiency in children with SCD.",
