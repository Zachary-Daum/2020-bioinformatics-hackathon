    abstract "Background: It is possible that physical education
 professionals, especially those who participate in aerobic activities, have
 predisposing factors, signs and symptoms of overreaching (OVR) and
 overtraining (OVT) due to a high load and volume of exercise followed by
 suboptimal recovery time. The present study aimed to identify the
 predisposing factors, signs and symptoms of OVR and OVT in physical education
 professionals. Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 42 questions (10
 questions group) about predisposing factors and signs/symptoms was answered
 by 132 physical education professionals from both sexes (83 men and 49 women)
 who were allocated into a resistance training group (RG, n = 74), aerobic
 training group (AG, n = 20) and resistance and aerobic training group (RAG, n
 = 38). A mean score was calculated ranging from 1 (completely absent) to 5
 (severe) for each question group. A low occurrence of predisposing factors
 and signs and symptoms of OVR and OVT was considered to be a question group
 score 4 or lower. Profile of Mood State Questionnaire (POMS) was also
 applied. Results: A mean score of 2.5 +/- 0.7, 2.7 +/- 0.7 and 2.7 +/- 0.8
 was found for all question groups for RG, AG and RAG, respectively. Of the
 total sample, 40.6% trained at least five times/week. The POMS revealed that
 67.5% of the RG (n = 50), 80% of the AG (n = 16) and 60.5% of the RAG (n =
 23) were classified as having no mood disorders and a standard graphic
 iceberg was presented. There were no statistical differences (p > 0.05) in
 the total mood disorders among RG (13.9 +/- 24.5), AG (10.3 +/- 25.1) and RAG
 (14.6 +/- 27.9) groups. Conclusion: Despite the volume of training/body
 working performed by the physical education professionals surveyed being
 greater than the recommended to achieve improvements on physical fitness,
 they did not show predisposing factors, signs or symptoms of OVR and OVT.",
