    abstract "PURPOSE: Left-handed (LH) residents remain underrepresented
 among surgical trainees, and there are few available data on how best to
 train them. The challenge is amplified when pairing a LH resident with a
 right-handed (RH) mentor. This report provides recommendations on how to
 improve the training of LH surgeons in a safe and effective manner. METHODS:
 A comprehensive literature review was performed using different databases and
 search engines to identify all articles relevant to the training of LH
 residents. RESULTS: A total of 40 articles highlighted the challenges for LH
 surgical residents and RH mentors. Our recommendations are based on the
 following 4 themes: identifying inherent differences in left vs. RH
 residents, providing guidance to RH mentors training LH residents, adapting
 the RH environment to the LH surgeon, and maximizing safety during training.
 CONCLUSION: An organized approach needs to be taken in training the LH
 resident. Changes should be instituted at program-wide and national levels to
 ensure that the training experience of the sinistral surgical resident is
 optimized.",
