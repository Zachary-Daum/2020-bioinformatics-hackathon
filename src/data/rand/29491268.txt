    abstract "Increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) was associated with
 cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in CKD patients. Our aim was to
 investigate the associations among estimated glomerular filtration rate
 (eGFR), albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) and PTH independent of
 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). This study included 9,162 individuals who
 completed the baseline survey of the Dong-gu Study, which was conducted in
 Korea from 2007 to 2010. The eGFR, ACR, PTH and 25(OH)D were measured in
 participants who met the detailed inclusion criteria. After being adjusting
 for covariates (sex, age, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol intake,
 physical activity, hypertension medications, diabetes medication, total
 cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol) and log-ACR, the PTH value
 stratified by 25(OH)D level significantly decreased with increasing eGFR
 levels in each 25(OH)D stratum. Moreover, after adjustment for the same
 covariates and log-eGFR, the PTH value stratified by 25(OH)D level
 significantly increased with increasing ACR levels in each 25(OH)D stratum.
 In conclusion, the PTH values significantly decreased with increasing eGFR
 levels and increased with increasing ACR levels independently of 25(OH)D in
 an adult Korean population >/=50 y of age.",
