    abstract "Dysregulation of microRNAs in various types of human cancer
 promote or suppress oncogenesis. MicroRNA (miR)-1 was previously revealed to
 function as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer cells, and its expression
 was associated with reduced metastatic potential in lung cancer. The present
 study investigated the role of miR-1 and its association with
 phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha
 (PIK3CA) in the pathophysiology of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC),
 and analyzed the effects of miR-1 inhibitor or mimics on sensitivity to
 epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the alterations
 of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in ESCC cells. Compared with normal
 tissues, the level of miR-1 expression was significantly lower and PIK3CA
 expression was higher in ESCC tissues. The level of miR-1 expression was also
 inversely associated with the level of PIK3CA mRNA expression. Low miR-1 and
 high PIK3CA expression levels were strongly associated with lymph node
 metastasis, and the level of miR-1 expression was negatively associated with
 clinical Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage. Furthermore, exogenous expression of
 miR-1 inhibited growth, arrested cell cycle in the G1 phase and increased
 apoptosis in ESCC cells, whereas it decreased PIK3CA protein expression
 levels. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-1 increased the sensitivity of
 ESCC cells to the anticancer drug, gefitinib. A possible mechanism for this
 increased sensitivity to gefitinib may be inactivation of the PIK3CA
 signaling pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
 the results of the present study demonstrated that miR-1 upregulation may be
 a potential strategy for the treatment of human ESCC.",
