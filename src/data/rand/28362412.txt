    abstract "Identifying and expanding patient-specific cells in culture for
 use in tissue engineering and disease investigation can be very challenging.
 Utilizing various types of stem cells to derive cell types of interest is
 often costly, time consuming and highly inefficient. Furthermore, undesired
 cell types must be removed prior to using this cell source, which requires
 another step in the process. In order to obtain enough esophageal epithelial
 cells to engineer the lumen of an esophageal construct or to screen
 therapeutic approaches for treating esophageal disease, native esophageal
 epithelial cells must be expanded without altering their gene expression or
 phenotype. Conditional reprogramming of esophageal epithelial tissue offers a
 promising approach to expanding patient-specific esophageal epithelial cells.
 Furthermore, these cells do not need to be sorted or purified and will return
 to a mature epithelial state after removing them from conditional
 reprogramming culture. This technique has been described in many cancer
 screening studies and allows for indefinite expansion of these cells over
 multiple passages. The ability to perform esophageal screening assays would
 help revolutionize the treatment of pediatric esophageal diseases like
 eosinophilic esophagitis by identifying the trigger mechanism causing the
 patient's symptoms. For those patients who suffer from congenital defect,
 disease or injury of the esophagus, this cell source could be used as a means
 to seed a synthetic construct for implantation to repair or replace the
 affected region.",
