    abstract "The newly released FDA guidance on immunogenicity assay
 development and validation recommends use of a lower confidence limit of the
 percentile of the negative subject population as the cut point in order to
 guarantee a pre-specified false positive rate with high confidence. The limit
 is, in essence, a lower tolerance limit. Although in literature several
 methods are available for determining the tolerance limit, they either fail
 to take into account the repeated measurement of the data from a typical
 immunogenicity assay quantification/validation experiment or rely heavily on
 normality assumption of the data, which is rarely correct. As a result, the
 methods may result in biased estimates of the cut point, causing the false
 positive rate to be either lower or higher than expected. To overcome this
 drawback, we propose two non-parametric methods under repeated measure data
 structure and without normal distribution assumption. Simulation studies were
 carried to compare the performance of the two non-parametric approaches with
 the current methods. The results of the simulation studies show that one of
 the two nonparametric methods outperforms all the other methods and provides
 a satisfactory coverage probability even with moderate sample sizes. In
 addition, it is simple and straightforward to implement. Therefore, it is a
 preferred method for immunogenicity assay cut point determination.",
