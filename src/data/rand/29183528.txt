    abstract "A negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for stage IB
 (T1b/T2a N0) melanoma would predict an excellent long-term prognosis.
 Combined with the concept of conditional survival, an ""abbreviated"" cancer
 surveillance strategy was implemented to reduce the number of visits and
 total length of follow-up. Retrospective review of all pathologic stage IB
 melanoma patients (negative SLNB) at a single institution between 2006 and
 2008 after implementation of an ""abbreviated"" cancer surveillance; clinic
 visits every six months for five years followed by one annual visit (total
 follow-up six years). Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and
 information regarding recurrences were obtained. Recurrence-free,
 disease-specific, and overall survival were calculated. Eighty-seven patients
 underwent the ""abbreviated"" cancer surveillance. Median age was 55.4 years
 and 50.6 per cent were male. Median Breslow thickness was 1.1 mm (range
 0.5-2.0 mm) and 1.1 per cent were ulcerated. Primary tumor site was 49 per
 cent extremities, 39 per cent trunk, and 12 per cent head/neck. Median
 follow-up was 68.6 months. Five-year recurrence-free, disease-specific, and
 overall survivals were 89, 95, and 88 per cent, respectively. During
 surveillance, 10 patients had concerning symptoms or physical findings
 prompting subsequent workup, all of which were negative for
 recurrence/metastases. There were only three true melanoma recurrences; all
 were distant metastases and presented symptomatically between scheduled
 follow-up visits. In light of the excellent prognosis for pathologic (SLNB
 negative) stage IB melanoma, an ""abbreviated"" cancer surveillance schedule
 based on conditional survival would reduce both direct and indirect costs in
 this cohort. The few recurrences were symptomatic and unlikely to have
 changed with more intensive surveillance.",
