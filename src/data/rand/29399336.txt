    abstract "Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) commonly exhibit
 orthostatic intolerance. Abnormal sympathetic predominance in the autonomic
 cardiovascular response to gravitational stimuli was previously described in
 numerous studies. The aim of the current study was to describe cardiological
 and clinical characteristics of Italian patients with CFS. All of the
 patients were of Caucasian ethnicity and had been referred to our center, the
 Cardiology Department of the University Hospital of Pavia (Pavia, Italy) with
 suspected CFS. A total of 44 patients with suspected CFS were included in the
 present study and the diagnosis was confirmed in 19 patients according to
 recent clinical guidelines. The characteristics at baseline of the population
 confirm findings from various previous reports regarding the prevalence in
 females with a female to male ratio of 4:1, the age of onset of the pathology
 and the presence of previous infection by the Epstein-Barr virus,
 cytomegalovirus and other human herpesviruses. Despite the current data
 indicating that the majority of the cardiological parameters investigated are
 not significantly different in patients with and without CFS, a significant
 association between the disease and low levels of blood pressure was
 identified. Other pilot studies revealed a higher prevalence of hypotension
 and orthostatic intolerance in patients with CFS. Furthermore, many of the
 CFS symptoms, including fatigue, vertigo, decreased concentration, tremors
 and nausea, may be explained by hypotension.",
