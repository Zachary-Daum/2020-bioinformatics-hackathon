    abstract "Acute kidney injury (AKI) currently is diagnosed by a temporal
 trend of a single blood analyte: serum creatinine. This measurement is
 neither sensitive nor specific to kidney injury or its protean forms. Newer
 biomarkers, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL, Lipocalin 2,
 Siderocalin), or kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1, Hepatitis A Virus Cellular
 Receptor 1), accelerate the diagnosis of AKI as well as prospectively
 distinguish rapidly reversible from prolonged causes of serum creatinine
 increase. Nonetheless, these biomarkers lack the capacity to subfractionate
 AKI further (eg, sepsis versus ischemia versus nephrotoxicity from
 medications, enzymes, or metals) or inform us about the primary and secondary
 sites of injury. It also is unknown whether all nephrons are injured in AKI,
 whether all cells in a nephron are affected, and whether injury responses can
 be stimulus-specific or cell type-specific or both. In this review, we
 summarize fully agnostic tissue interrogation approaches that may help to
 redefine AKI in cellular and molecular terms, including single-cell and
 single-nuclei RNA sequencing technology. These approaches will empower a
 shift in the current paradigm of AKI diagnosis, classification, and staging,
 and provide the renal community with a significant advance toward precision
 medicine in the analysis AKI.",
