    abstract "The dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA)-derived metabolite of
 12-lipoxygenase, 12-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), was recently
 shown to potently inhibit thrombus formation without prolonging bleeding in
 murine models. Although 12-HETrE was found to inhibit platelet activation via
 the Galphas signaling pathway, the Galphas-coupled receptor by which 12-HETrE
 mediates its antiplatelet effects has yet to be identified. Defining the
 receptor by which 12-HETrE exerts its effects is key to determining its
 therapeutic potential as an antiplatelet drug. Therefore, the goal of this
 study was to determine the Galphas-coupled platelet receptor through which
 12-HETrE exerts its antiplatelet effects. In this study, we showed that
 pharmacological inhibition of the prostacyclin (IP) receptor in human
 platelets or genetic ablation of IP in murine platelets prevented 12-HETrE
 from blocking aggregation in vitro. Furthermore, the antithrombotic effects
 of 12-HETrE were significantly diminished in IP knockout mice in vivo.
 Together these data demonstrate that the antiplatelet effects of 12-HETrE are
 at least partially dependent on IP signaling. Importantly, this work
 identified 12-HETrE as a novel regulator of IP signaling that may aid in the
 rationale for design of novel therapeutics to inhibit platelet function.
 Additionally, this study provides further insight into the mechanism by which
 DGLA supplementation inhibits platelets function.",
