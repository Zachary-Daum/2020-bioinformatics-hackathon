    abstract "The study aimed to review the etiology of failed back surgery
 syndrome (FBSS) and to propose a treatment algorithm based on a systematic
 review of the current literature and individual experience. FBSS is a term
 that groups the conditions with recurring low back pain after spine surgery
 with or without a radicular component. Since the information on FBSS
 incidence is limited, data needs to be retrieved from old studies. It is
 generally accepted that its incidence ranges between 10% and 40% after lumbar
 laminectomy with or without fusion. Although the etiology of FBSS is not
 completely understood, it is possibly multifactorial, and the causative
 factors may be categorized into preoperative, operative, and postoperative
 factors. The evaluation of patients with FBSS symptoms should ideally
 initiate with reviewing the patients' clinical history (observing ""red flags
""), followed by a detailed clinical examination and imaging (whole-body
 X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography). FBSS is a
 complex and difficult pathology, and its accurate diagnosis is of utmost
 importance. Its management should be multidisciplinary, and special attention
 should be provided to cases of recurrent disc herniation and postoperative
 spinal imbalance.",
