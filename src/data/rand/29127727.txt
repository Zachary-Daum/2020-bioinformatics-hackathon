    abstract "SH2B1 is a multidomain protein that serves as a key adaptor to
 regulate numerous cellular events, such as insulin, leptin, and growth
 hormone signaling pathways. Many of these protein-protein interactions are
 mediated by the SH2 domain of SH2B1, which recognizes ligands containing a
 phosphorylated tyrosine (pY), including peptides derived from janus kinase 2,
 insulin receptor, and insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2. Specificity for
 the SH2 domain of SH2B1 is conferred in these ligands either by a hydrophobic
 or an acidic side chain at the +3 position C-terminal to the pY. This
 specificity for chemically disparate species suggests that SH2B1 relies on
 distinct thermodynamic or structural mechanisms to bind to peptides. Using
 binding and structural strategies, we have identified unique thermodynamic
 signatures for each peptide binding mode, and several SH2B1 residues,
 including K575 and R578, that play distinct roles in peptide binding. The
 high-resolution structure of the SH2 domain of SH2B1 further reveals
 conformationally plastic protein loops that may contribute to the ability of
 the protein to recognize dissimilar ligands. Together, numerous hydrophobic
 and electrostatic interactions, in addition to backbone conformational
 flexibility, permit the recognition of diverse peptides by SH2B1. An
 understanding of this expanded peptide recognition will allow for the
 identification of novel physiologically relevant SH2B1/peptide interactions,
 which can contribute to the design of obesity and diabetes pharmaceuticals to
 target the ligand-binding interface of SH2B1 with high specificity.",
