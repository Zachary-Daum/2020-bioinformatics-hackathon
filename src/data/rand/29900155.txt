    abstract "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a cytokine that
 plays an important role in both normal joints and joints affected by
 osteoarthritis (OA), the most common joint disease. However, the role of this
 pleiotropic cytokine in a normal healthy joint is very different from its
 role in an OA joint. In a normal synovial joint, active TGF-beta is only
 present after joint loading and only for a short period. In contrast,
 permanent and high levels of active TGF-beta are detected in OA joints. Due
 to this difference in levels and exposure period of joint cells to active
 TGF-beta, the function of TGF-beta is strikingly different in normal and OA
 joints. The consequences of this difference in TGF-beta levels on joint
 homeostasis and pathological changes in OA joints are discussed in this
 review.",
