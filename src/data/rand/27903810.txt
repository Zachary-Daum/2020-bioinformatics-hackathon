    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To report long-term safety and efficacy outcomes of a
 large cohort of patients with medically refractory isolated dystonia treated
 with subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS). METHODS: Twenty
 patients (12 male, 8 female; mean age 49 +/- 16.3 years) with medically
 refractory isolated dystonia were studied (14 were followed for 36 months).
 The primary endpoints were change in Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale
 (BFMDRS) motor score and Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale
 (TWSTRS) total score at 36 months compared to preoperative baseline. Multiple
 secondary outcomes were also assessed (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00773604).
 RESULTS: Eighteen of 20 patients showed improvement 12 months after STN DBS
 with sustained benefit persisting for 3 years (n = 14). At 36 months, BFMDRS
 motor scores improved 70.4% from a mean 17.9 +/- 8.5 to 5.3 +/- 5.6 (p =
 0.0002) and total TWSTRS scores improved 66.6% from a mean 41.0 +/- 18.9 to
 13.7 +/- 17.9 (p = 0.0002). Improvement at 36 months was equivalent to that
 seen at 6 months. Disability and quality of life measures were also improved.
 Three hardware-related and 24 stimulation-related nonserious adverse events
 occurred between years 1 and 3 (including 4 patients with dyskinesia).
 CONCLUSIONS: This study offers support for long-term tolerability and
 sustained effectiveness of STN DBS in the treatment of severe forms of
 isolated dystonia. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV
 evidence that STN DBS decreases long-term dystonia severity in patients with
 medically refractory isolated dystonia.",
