    abstract "The trans-10,cis-12 isomer of conjugated linoleic acid
 (t10c12-CLA) is a biohydrogenation intermediate in the rumen and has been
 shown to cause milk fat depression in dairy goats. However, few studies have
 focused on the in vitro molecular mechanisms involved in the response of the
 goat mammary gland to t10c12-CLA. In the present study, RNA sequencing
 technology was used to investigate the effects of t10c12-CLA on goat mammary
 epithelial cells. From the data, 25,153 annotated transcripts were obtained,
 and differentially expressed genes were selected based on a false discovery
 rate <0.05. Candidate genes and potent cellular signaling pathways were
 identified through Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis. Next, real-time
 quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses were used to verify the results of
 the RNA sequencing data. The results indicated that t10c12-CLA inhibits fatty
 acid synthesis through downregulation of genes involved in de novo fatty acid
 synthesis, and this process is likely correlated with the activation of the
 AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.",
