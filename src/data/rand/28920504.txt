    abstract "The number of women undergoing induction of labour has risen
 steadily in recent years. Outpatient induction is becoming more common in the
 UK in response to the required increase in resources, although evidence
 supporting its safety is lacking. We reviewed the notes of low-risk women
 presenting for outpatient cervical ripening using prostaglandins over a
 five-year period, and compared our neonatal and maternal outcomes to local
 and national data. Of the 502 eligible women, 400 underwent outpatient
 treatment. Most women returned early, in labour. There were no foetal,
 neonatal or maternal deaths, and our neonatal morbidity compared favourably
 with local rates. Mode of delivery and major maternal complication rates were
 comparable to national maternity indicators. We conclude that outpatient
 cervical ripening following careful case selection does not appear to
 increase neonatal or maternal mortality or morbidity. It offers patients an
 alternative to traditional inpatient induction and may improve allocation of
 hospital resources. Impact statement We present a retrospective cohort study
 of neonatal and maternal outcomes in 502 women selected for outpatient
 cervical ripening for postmaturity at Bedford Hospital over the five-year
 period from 2010 to 2015. This study was conceived following a previous
 publication in this journal from Bedford Hospital in 2002 by Neale et al.,
 which described the outcomes of 100 women who underwent outpatient cervical
 ripening. Our conclusions compare the results from the two studies. Out of
 our combined sample of 602 women, 491 were discharged home following
 administration of prostaglandins. This represents the largest sample size in
 the published literature on outpatient induction of labour, which was first
 undertaken in our unit in 1998 and is now widely practiced within the UK.
 Several publications, including the 2013 Cochrane review by Kelly et al. and
 a recent large survey of practice (Sharp et al. 2016 ) have highlighted the
 paucity of available data regarding the safety of this procedure as an
 outpatient. We therefore hope that the results of our study will be of
 interest to many maternity units who currently undertake or are considering
 to provide the facility for outpatient cervical ripening as a prelude to
 induction of labour.",
