    abstract "BACKGROUND : Direct observation of clinical skills is a
 cornerstone of competency-based education and training. Ensuring direct
 observation in a consistent fashion has been a significant challenge for
 residency programs. OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
 effects of a novel evaluation system, designed to achieve ongoing direct
 observation of residents, examine changes in resident observation practices,
 and understand faculty attitudes toward direct observation and the evaluation
 system. METHODS : Internal medicine residents on an ambulatory block rotation
 participated in a new evaluation system, which replaced a single
 end-of-rotation summative evaluation with 9 formative evaluations based on
 direct observation. Faculty received training in direct observation and use
 of the forms, and residents were given responsibility to collect 9
 observations per rotation. Faculty members contacted residents at the
 beginning and middle of the rotation to ensure completion of the
 observations. Residents and faculty also completed postrotation surveys to
 gauge the impact of the new system. RESULTS : A total of 507 patient
 encounters were directly observed, and 52 of 57 (91%) residents completed all
 9 observations. Residents reported considerably more direct observation than
 prior to the intervention, and most reported changes to their clinical skills
 based on faculty feedback. Faculty reported improvements in their attitudes,
 increased their use of direct observation, and preferred the new system to
 the old one. CONCLUSIONS : A novel evaluation system replacing summative
 evaluations with multiple formative evaluations based on direct observation
 was successful in achieving high rates of observations, and improving faculty
 attitudes toward direct observation.",
