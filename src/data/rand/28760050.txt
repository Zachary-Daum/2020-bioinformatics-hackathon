    abstract "PURPOSE: Among negative emotions, anger has not been studied in
 as much depth in her connection to postpartum mood disorders. The study aimed
 to investigate the role of anger as a potential vulnerability factor
 increasing the risk of Maternity Blues (MB) and Postpartum Depression (PPD).
 MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy
 underwent the following tests: the State Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 -
 STAXI-2 (baseline visit), the Blues Questionnaire -BQ (3 and 5 days after
 delivery), and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (3 and 6
 months following delivery). RESULTS: One hundred ten subjects were included
 in this study. The prevalence rate of mothers with MB was about 35%, whereas
 about 4% of women developed a PPD. Significant positive correlations were
 found among State anger (SANG), Trait anger (TANG), anger expression out
 (AXO) and in (AXI) and postpartum depressive disorders, as measured by blues
 questionnaire (BQ) and EPDS. CONCLUSIONS: Anger experience and expression can
 be considered as vulnerability factors for postpartum mood disorders onset.
 Particularly, the expression of angry feelings toward other persons or
 objects in the environment (AXO) predicts the onset of MB, whereas holding in
 or suppressing angry feelings (AXI) could be a risk factor for subsequent PPD.",
