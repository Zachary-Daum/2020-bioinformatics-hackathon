    abstract "The LIM domain only protein LMO3 is a transcriptional regulator
 that has been shown to regulate several behavioral responses to alcohol.
 Specifically, Lmo3 null (Lmo3(Z)) mice consume more ethanol in a
 binge-drinking test and show enhanced ethanol-induced sedation. Due to the
 high comorbidity of alcohol use and anxiety, we investigated anxiety-like
 behavior in Lmo3(Z) mice. Lmo3(Z) mice spent more time in the open arms of
 the elevated plus maze compared with their wild-type littermates, but the
 effect was confounded by reduced locomotor activity. To verify the anxiety
 phenotype in the Lmo3(Z) mice, we tested them for novelty-induced hypophagia
 and found that they also showed reduced anxiety in this test. We next
 explored the mechanism by which LMO3 might regulate anxiety by measuring mRNA
 and protein levels of corticotropin releasing factor (encoded by the Crh
 gene) and its receptor type 1 (Crhr1) in Lmo3(Z) mice. Reduced Crhr1 mRNA and
 protein was evident in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of Lmo3(Z) mice. To
 examine whether Lmo3 in the amygdala is important for anxiety-like behavior,
 we locally reduced Lmo3 expression in the BLA of wild type mice using a
 lentiviral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA targeting the Lmo3
 transcript. Mice with Lmo3 knockdown in the BLA exhibited decreased
 anxiety-like behavior relative to control mice. These results suggest that
 Lmo3 promotes anxiety-like behavior specifically in the BLA, possibly by
 altering Crhr1 expression. This study is the first to support a role for Lmo3
 in anxiety-like behavior.",
