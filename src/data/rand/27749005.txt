    abstract "Sexual selection can increase rates of adaptation by imposing
 strong selection in males, thereby allowing efficient purging of the mutation
 load on population fitness at a low demographic cost. Indeed, sexual
 selection tends to be male-biased throughout the animal kingdom, but little
 empirical work has explored the ecological sensitivity of this sex
 difference. In this study, we generated theoretical predictions of
 sex-specific strengths of selection, environmental sensitivities and
 genotype-by-environment interactions and tested them in seed beetles by
 manipulating either larval host plant or rearing temperature. Using fourteen
 isofemale lines, we measured sex-specific reductions in fitness components,
 genotype-by-environment interactions and the strength of selection (variance
 in fitness) in the juvenile and adult stage. As predicted, variance in
 fitness increased with stress, was consistently greater in males than females
 for adult reproductive success (implying strong sexual selection), but was
 similar in the sexes in terms of juvenile survival across all levels of
 stress. Although genetic variance in fitness increased in magnitude under
 severe stress, heritability decreased and particularly so in males. Moreover,
 genotype-by-environment interactions for fitness were common but specific to
 the type of stress, sex and life stage, suggesting that new environments may
 change the relative alignment and strength of selection in males and females.
 Our study thus exemplifies how environmental stress can influence the
 relative forces of natural and sexual selection, as well as concomitant
 changes in genetic variance in fitness, which are predicted to have
 consequences for rates of adaptation in sexual populations.",
