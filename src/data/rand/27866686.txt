    abstract "When designing nanoparticles for drug delivery, many variables
 such as size, loading efficiency, and cytotoxicity should be considered.
 Usually, smaller particles are preferred in drug delivery because of longer
 blood circulation time and their ability to escape from immune system,
 whereas smaller nanoparticles often show increased toxicity. Determination of
 parameters which affect size of particles and factors such as loading
 efficiency and cytotoxicity could be very helpful in designing drug delivery
 systems. In this work, albumin (as a protein drug model)-loaded chitosan
 nanoparticles were prepared by polyelectrolyte complexation method.
 Simultaneously, effects of 4 independent variables including chitosan and
 albumin concentrations, pH, and reaction time were determined on 3 dependent
 variables (i.e., size, loading efficiency, and cytotoxicity) by artificial
 neural networks. Results showed that concentrations of initial materials are
 the most important factors which may affect the dependent variables. A drop
 in the concentrations decreases the size directly, but they simultaneously
 decrease loading efficiency and increase cytotoxicity. Therefore, an
 optimization of the independent variables is required to obtain the most
 useful preparation.",
