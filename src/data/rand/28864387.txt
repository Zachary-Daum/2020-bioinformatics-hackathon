    abstract "Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (also known as giant cell tumor of
 tendon sheath or pigmented villonodular synovitis) is a rare soft tissue
 tumor that arises from the tenosynovium of a tendon sheath or the synovium of
 a diarthrodial joint. This disease process occurs infrequently in the foot
 and ankle but can result in significant bone erosion and destructive changes
 of affected joints. These cases are challenging to treat, because the tumor
 most commonly presents in young, active patients and can be associated with
 extensive bone loss. We review a case of tenosynovial giant cell tumor of
 tendon sheath of the midfoot, which was treated with mass resection,
 structural femoral head allograft bone grafting, and internal fixation with
 dorsal plating. The patient had achieved successful bony fusion and
 acceptable functional outcomes at the final follow-up visit 40 months
 postoperatively.",
