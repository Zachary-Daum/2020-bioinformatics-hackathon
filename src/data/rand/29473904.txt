    abstract "The SCN5A gene encodes the pore-forming alpha-subunit of the ion
 channel that carries the cardiac fast sodium current (INa). The 1795insD
 mutation in SCN5A causes sinus bradycardia, with a mean heart rate of 70
 beats/min in mutation carriers vs. 77 beats/min in non-carriers from the same
 family (lowest heart rate 41 vs. 47 beats/min). To unravel the underlying
 mechanism, we incorporated the mutation-induced changes in INa into a
 recently developed comprehensive computational model of a single human
 sinoatrial node cell (Fabbri-Severi model). The 1795insD mutation reduced the
 beating rate of the model cell from 74 to 69 beats/min (from 49 to 43
 beats/min in the simulated presence of 20 nmol/L acetylcholine). The
 mutation-induced persistent INa per se resulted in a substantial increase in
 beating rate. This gain-of-function effect was almost completely counteracted
 by the loss-of-function effect of the reduction in INa conductance. The
 further loss-of-function effect of the shifts in steady-state activation and
 inactivation resulted in an overall loss-of-function effect of the 1795insD
 mutation. We conclude that the experimentally identified mutation-induced
 changes in INa can explain the clinically observed sinus bradycardia.
 Furthermore, we conclude that the Fabbri-Severi model may prove a useful tool
 in understanding cardiac pacemaker activity in humans.",
