    abstract "Giant clams (subfamily Tridacnidae) house their obligate
 symbionts, Symbiodinium sp., in a specialized tubular system. Rapid uptake of
 Symbiodinium has been shown to increase early clam survival, suggesting that
 symbionts play an essential role in host growth and development. To determine
 whether symbionts influence development in the giant clam Hippopus hippopus,
 we compared growth patterns and cell proliferation in two groups of clams
 inoculated or not inoculated (control) with Symbiodinium sp. Symbiont uptake
 occurred continuously from days 8 to 26 post-fertilization, with, on average,
  approximately 5% per day colonized. The control treatment grew even without
 symbionts (1.03 +/- 0.41 microm per day, standard error). Inoculated
 individuals grew significantly faster (2.91 +/- 0.37 microm per day) than
 control individuals (P < 0.001). However, daily shell length measurements did
 not significantly differ between treatments until day 22, and  approximately
 97% of control individuals metamorphosed by day 24, suggesting a delay in
 growth effects. Consistent with this, at day 13, clam cell proliferation was
 not correlated with symbiont abundance in inoculated individuals (P = 0.13),
 while at day 26, it was (P < 0.01). The proliferating cell pattern also
 changed from being randomly distributed (P = 0.99) at day 13 to non-randomly
 distributed (P = 0.002), with increased likelihood of proliferation within 
 approximately 25 microm of a symbiont, at day 26. Our results indicate that
 H. hippopus has a longer Symbiodinium acquisition period than previously
 recorded, after which proliferation and development are enhanced but during
 which growth is unaffected by Symbiodinium.",
