    abstract "Dietary preworkout supplements are popular among recreational
 exercisers and athletes. However, the effects of these supplements on the
 vasculature, both at rest and during exercise, are not well studied.
 Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 1 week of
 supplementation with a multi-ingredient dietary preworkout supplement on
 measures of vascular function at rest and immediately following acute
 resistance exercise in young, recreationally active adults. Twelve
 participants (9 males and 3 females; mean +/- SD: age = 24.5 +/- 3.4 years
 and body mass index = 24.3 +/- 4.7 kg/m(2)) completed this double-blind,
 randomized, crossover design study. After familiarization, participants were
 randomized to either a taste-matched placebo or the preworkout supplement for
 1 week preceding the testing visits. Participants underwent measures of
 vascular function, including brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, measures
 of central and peripheral blood pressure, and measures of arterial stiffness
 via pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity. All measures were taken at
 rest and immediately following an acute bilateral leg press exercise session.
 Resting and postacute exercise flow-mediated dilation, blood pressure, and
 arterial stiffness were similar between the placebo and the preworkout
 supplement visits. One week of multi-ingredient preworkout supplementation
 does not affect vascular function at rest or in response to an acute bout of
 resistance exercise in young, healthy, recreationally active individuals.",
