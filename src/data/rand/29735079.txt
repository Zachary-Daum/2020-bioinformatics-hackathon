    abstract "Food allergen labelling is mandatory and regulated whilst
 precautionary allergen labelling (PAL) remains voluntary in most countries.
 It is the aim of this study to identify the food allergens declared in food
 products sold in a developing country and to what extent food allergens and
 PAL are emphasised in the products. A total of 505 food and beverages
 (snacks, baked goods, confectionary, baby food, condiments & jams, beverages,
 powder & paste, instant food, chilled & frozen food and canned food) were
 evaluated in Malaysia. Soybean represents the largest group of food allergen
 declared in labels, followed by wheat and milk products. Thirteen variations
 of contains statement were found with ""Contains [allergen(s)]"" being the
 most common (55.02%). There were 22 different types of ""may contain""
 statements with 'May contain traces of [allergen(s)]' being the most common
 advice labelling used (55.41%). Different font type or emphasis such as
 brackets (51.57%) and bold font (33.86%) were used to inform consumers about
 presence of allergens. The national regulations on food allergen labelling
 are then critically contrasted with other Asian countries and the EU
 Regulation No. 1169/2011, which represents one of the most stringent food
 regulations in the world. Improving current allergen labelling limitations
 and practices would be of great benefit to consumers to prevent risk of food
 hypersensitivity.",
