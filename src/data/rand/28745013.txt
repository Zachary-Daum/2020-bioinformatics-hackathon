    abstract "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Given the complexity of factors
 contributing to alcohol misuse, appropriate epistemologies and methodologies
 are needed to understand and intervene meaningfully. We aimed to (1) provide
 an overview of computational modeling methodologies, with an emphasis on
 system dynamics modeling; (2) explain how community-based system dynamics
 modeling can forge new directions in alcohol prevention research; and (3)
 present a primer on how to build alcohol misuse simulation models using
 system dynamics modeling, with an emphasis on stakeholder involvement, data
 sources and model validation. Throughout, we use alcohol misuse among college
 students in the United States as a heuristic example for demonstrating these
 methodologies. METHODS: System dynamics modeling employs a top-down aggregate
 approach to understanding dynamically complex problems. Its three
 foundational properties-stocks, flows and feedbacks-capture non-linearity,
 time-delayed effects and other system characteristics. As a methodological
 choice, system dynamics modeling is amenable to participatory approaches; in
 particular, community-based system dynamics modeling has been used to build
 impactful models for addressing dynamically complex problems. RESULTS: The
 process of community-based system dynamics modeling consists of numerous
 stages: (1) creating model boundary charts, behavior-over-time-graphs and
 preliminary system dynamics models using group model-building techniques; (2)
 model formulation; (3) model calibration; (4) model testing and validation;
 and (5) model simulation using learning-laboratory techniques. CONCLUSIONS:
 Community-based system dynamics modeling can provide powerful tools for
 policy and intervention decisions that can result ultimately in sustainable
 changes in research and action in alcohol misuse prevention.",
