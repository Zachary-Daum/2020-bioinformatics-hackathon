    abstract "OBJECTIVE Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a progressive
 spinal condition that often requires surgery. Studies have shown the clinical
 equivalency of anterior versus posterior approaches for CSM surgery. The
 purpose of this study was to determine the amount and type of resources used
 for anterior and posterior surgical treatment of CSM by using large national
 databases of clinical and financial information from patients. METHODS This
 study consists of 2 large cohorts of patients who underwent either an
 anterior or posterior approach for treatment of CSM. These patients were
 selected from the Medicare 5% National Sample Administrative Database (SAF5)
 and the Humana orthopedic database (HORTHO), which is a database of patients
 with private payer health insurance. The outcome measures were the cost of a
 90-day episode of care, as well as a breakdown of the cost components for
 each surgical procedure between 2005 and 2014. RESULTS A total of 16,444
 patients were included in this analysis. In HORTHO, there were 10,332 and
 1556 patients treated with an anterior or posterior approach for CSM,
 respectively. In SAF5, there were 3851 and 705 patients who were treated by
 an anterior or posterior approach for CSM, respectively. The mean +/- SD
 reimbursements for anterior and posterior approaches in the HORTHO database
 were $20,863 +/- $2014 and $23,813 +/- $4258, respectively (p = 0.048). The
 mean +/- SD reimbursements for anterior and posterior approaches in the SAF5
 database were $18,219 +/- $1053 and $25,598 +/- $1686, respectively (p <
 0.0001). There were also significantly higher reimbursements for a
 rehabilitation/skilled nursing facility and hospital/inpatient care for
 patients who underwent a posterior approach in both the private payer and
 Medicare databases. In all cohorts in this study, the hospital-related
 reimbursement was more than double the surgeon-related reimbursement.
 CONCLUSIONS This study provides resource utilization information for a 90-day
 episode of care for both anterior and posterior approaches for CSM surgery.
 There is a statistically significant higher resource utilization for patients
 undergoing the posterior approach for CSM, which is consistent with the
 literature. Understanding the reimbursement patterns for anterior versus
 posterior approaches for CSM will help providers design a bundled payment for
 patients requiring surgery for CSM, and this study suggests that a subset of
 patients who require the posterior approach for treatment also require
 greater resources. The data also suggest that hospital-related reimbursement
 is the major driver of payments.",
