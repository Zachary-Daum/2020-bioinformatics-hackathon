    abstract "Long bone defects comprise one of the most prevalent clinical
 problems worldwide and the current bone grafting materials have major
 limitations to repair them. Although tremendous efforts have been made to
 repair critical-sized long bone defects in animal models, designing an
 optimal bone tissue-engineered substitute remains one of the main challenges.
 Hence, this study aims to closely mimic a natural bone healing process by a
 tissue-engineered construct including osteoinductive materials pre-seeded
 with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Bioactive glass (BG)
 was incorporated into the gelatin/nano-hydroxyapatite (G/nHAp) scaffold
 (conventional one) to improve the bone regeneration process via its
 osteoinductivity and angiogenic activity. The fabricated G/nHAp and
 gelatin/nano-hydroxyapatite/bioactive glass (G/nHAp/BG) scaffolds were
 characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy
 (SEM) and analyzed for porosity and degradation rate. The osteogenic
 capability of fabricated scaffolds with or without BMSCs was then evaluated
 in vitro and in vivo. Critical-sized radial bone defects in rats were
 randomly filled with cell-free and BMSC-seeded scaffolds, autograft and a
 group left empty without any treatment. In vitro analysis showed that the
 G/nHAp/BG scaffold significantly increased the expression level of osteogenic
 and angiogenic markers in comparison to the G/nHAp-treated and control groups
 (P < 0.05). Moreover, the defects treated with the BMSC-seeded scaffolds
 showed superior bone formation and structural properties compared to the
 cell-free scaffolds 4 and 12 weeks post surgery. The radiological and
 histomorphological properties of defects treated by BMSC-seeded scaffolds,
 especially the BMSC-seeded G/nHAp/BG scaffold, were comparable to those of
 the autograft group. It is concluded that the combination of osteoconductive
 materials (i.e., nHAp) with the bioactive ones such as bioactive glass can
 effectively accelerate the bone regeneration process. In addition, our
 results demonstrated that the BMSCs have the potential to drastically
 increase the bone regeneration ability of osteoinductive scaffolds.",
