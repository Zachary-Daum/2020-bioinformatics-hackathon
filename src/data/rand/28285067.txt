    abstract "OBJECTIVES: To incorporate a published clinical tool related to
 heart failure (HF) assessment into advanced pharmacy practice experiences in
 the community pharmacy setting to provide a meaningful and innovative
 learning experience for students. SETTING: Sixteen independent and chain
 community pharmacies that served as advanced pharmacy practice experience
 locations. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Sixteen community pharmacy locations served
 as rotation sites and participated in data collection (8 chain and 8
 independent). PRACTICE INNOVATION: This was the first study in which pharmacy
 students used The One-Minute Clinic for Heart Failure (TOM-C HF) tool to
 assess HF within the community pharmacy setting. INTERVENTIONS: Trained
 student pharmacists identified patients who may have heart failure by
 evaluating medication dispensing records, interviewed the patient using the
 TOM-C HF tool, and made interventions as clinically appropriate. EVALUATION:
 The number of students using the TOM-C HF tool, the number and types of
 interventions made, and student perceptions about the educational and
 professional value of the patient interaction. RESULTS: Thirty-three of 83
 (40%) students completed 63 patient assessments. Thirty-five percent of
 patients (22/63) were candidates for an intervention. Interventions were
 performed in 9 of 22 patients (41%). More than 65% of students found the
 patient interaction to have educational and professional value. CONCLUSION:
 Students were able to assess HF patients and make interventions in a
 community pharmacy setting. The majority of students also perceived some
 value in these assessments. The incorporation of a clinical tool in the
 community setting driven by fourth-year pharmacy students has been shown to
 be feasible and to provide both a novel advanced practice experience. In
 addition, it may be expandable to the services offered at community
 pharmacies.",
