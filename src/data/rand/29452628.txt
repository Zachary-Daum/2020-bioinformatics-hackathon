    abstract "Medical literature is replete with evidence regarding physical
 rehabilitation of the amputee; however, scant attention has been paid to
 psychological rehabilitation. The objective was to perform an integrative
 review of the published medical evidence regarding amputee peer support in
 the civilian population and provide an evidence-based clinical practice
 recommendation. This study was based on an exhaustive examination of the
 civilian amputee peer support medical evidence, bibliographic search, and on
 the experience of the authors when performing this integrative review. Our
 search uncovered 10 published peer-reviewed pieces of medical evidence
 including one level III retrospective case controlled trial, two level IV
 case series, and seven level V expert opinions. Given the totality of the
 published evidence, albeit limited, in favor of amputee peer support, an
 abundance of unpublished anecdotal evidence, virtually no potential risk of
 harm, and low cost, it seems reasonable to recommend incorporating a
 preoperative and/or postoperative peer visit in clinical protocols for all
 patients incurring a major limb amputation.",
