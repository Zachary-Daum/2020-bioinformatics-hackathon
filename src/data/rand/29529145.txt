    abstract "Background: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used
 exploratory method in epidemiology to derive dietary patterns from habitual
 diet. Such dietary patterns seem to originate from intakes on multiple days
 and eating occasions. Therefore, analyzing food intake of study populations
 with different levels of food consumption can provide additional insights as
 to how habitual dietary patterns are formed. Objective: We analyzed the food
 intake data of German adults in terms of the relations among food groups from
 three 24-h dietary recalls (24hDRs) on the habitual, single-day, and
 main-meal levels, and investigated the contribution of each level to the
 formation of PCA-derived habitual dietary patterns. Design: Three 24hDRs were
 collected in 2010-2012 from 816 adults for an European Prospective
 Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam subcohort study. We
 identified PCA-derived habitual dietary patterns and compared cross-sectional
 food consumption data in terms of correlation (Spearman), consistency
 (intraclass correlation coefficient), and frequency of consumption across all
 days and main meals. Contribution to the formation of the dietary patterns
 was obtained through Spearman correlation of the dietary pattern scores.
 Results: Among the meals, breakfast appeared to be the most consistent eating
 occasion within individuals. Dinner showed the strongest correlations with 
""Prudent"" (Spearman correlation = 0.60), ""Western"" (Spearman correlation =
 0.59), and ""Traditional"" (Spearman correlation = 0.60) dietary patterns
 identified on the habitual level, and lunch showed the strongest correlations
 with the ""Cereals and legumes"" (Spearman correlation = 0.60) habitual
 dietary pattern. Conclusions: Higher meal consistency was related to lower
 contributions to the formation of PCA-derived habitual dietary patterns.
 Absolute amounts of food consumption did not strongly conform to the habitual
 dietary patterns by meals, suggesting that these patterns are formed by
 complex combinations of variable food consumption across meals. Dinner showed
 the highest contribution to the formation of habitual dietary patterns. This
 study provided information about how PCA-derived dietary patterns are formed
 and how they could be influenced.",
