    abstract "The small size of nanoparticles (NPs), with dimensions between 1
 and 100 nm, results in unique chemical and physical characteristics, which is
 why they are implemented in various consumer products. Therefore, an
 important concern is the potential detrimental impact of NPs on the
 environment. As plants are a vital part of ecosystem, investigation of the
 phytotoxic effects of NPs is particularly interesting. This study
 investigated the potential phytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on
 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants and compared it with the effects of the
 same AgNO3 concentrations. Accumulation of silver in roots and leaves was
 equally efficient after both AgNP and AgNO3 treatment, with predominant Ag
 levels found in the roots. Exposure to AgNPs did not result in elevated
 values of oxidative stress parameters either in roots or in leaves, while
 AgNO3 induced oxidative stress in both plant tissues. In the presence of both
 AgNPs and AgNO3, root meristem cells became highly vacuolated, which
 indicates that vacuoles might be the primary storage target for accumulated
 Ag. Direct AgNP uptake by root cells was confirmed. Leaf ultrastructural
 studies revealed changes mainly in the size of chloroplasts of AgNP-treated
 and AgNO3-treated plants. All of these findings indicate that nano form of
 silver is less toxic to tobacco plants than silver ions.",
