    abstract "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the protection
 of the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle in alveolar bone operation in
 conditions such as chronic osteomyelitis and cementoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
 The study enrolled 7 cases, 4 with chronic osteomyelitis and 3 with cementoma
 with pain. Computed tomography scan and 3-dimensional reconstruction were
 performed for the diseases. Data were processed by ProPlan CMF 1.3 software.
 The edge of lesion was defined and the inferior alveolar nerve was marked.
 Template was designed to guide the osteotomy line. Piezosurgery was used for
 osteotomy, with the avoidance of nerve canal. Current perception threshold
 (CPT) was performed to evaluate the nerve function after operation. RESULTS:
 The CPT difference of the affected side before and after operation showed no
 statistically significant differences compared with that of the unaffected
 side (P = 0.0556). CONCLUSIONS: Digital template protects the inferior
 alveolar neurovascular bundle with the aid of piezosurgery during alveolar
 bone resection, which obtained satisfying clinical results. As powerful
 assistive tools of functional surgery, digital template and piezosurgery
 achieve both the purposes of treatment and function.",
