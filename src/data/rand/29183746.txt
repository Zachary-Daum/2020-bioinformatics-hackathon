    abstract "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Extracts of leaves and bark of
 Aniba fragrans are used as tea (decoction) to treat snakebites in communities
 in the Brazilian Amazon. The aqueous extract of the leaves of A. fragrans has
 been proven to be effective against Bothrops venom, but only when
 pre-incubated with the venom. This study sought to assess the potential of
 different types of extract of this species to inhibit the biological
 activities of Bothrops atrox venom (BaV) when used the same way as in folk
 medicine. The main classes of secondary metabolites and the concentrations of
 phenolics in the extracts were also determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four
 types of extract of A. fragrans were prepared: aqueous extract of the leaf
 (AEL), aqueous extract of the bark (AEB), hydroalcoholic leaf extract (HLE)
 and extract of the residue from hydrodistillation of the leaf (ERHL). The
 phytochemical profiles of the aqueous extracts were determined using thin
 layer chromatography (TLC), and the concentrations of phenolics were measured
 by colorimetric assays. To investigate the potential of the extracts to
 inhibit the biological activities of BaV, in vitro tests for
 antiphospholipase and antifibrinolytic activities were performed. In vivo
 tests for antihemorrhagic and antidefibrinating activities were also carried
 out, as well as antimicrobial tests for activity against the main bacteria
 found in the oral cavity of snakes. Interaction between the extracts and the
 proteins in BaV was assessed by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot
 (WB). The cytotoxicity of the extracts was assessed in a strain of MRC-5
 human fibroblasts. RESULTS: Terpenoids, flavonoids and condensed and
 hydrolysable tannins were detected in all the extracts. Metabolites such as
 coumarins, fatty acids and alkaloids were present in some extracts but not in
 others, indicating different phytochemical profiles. Phenolics content varied
 between extracts, and there were more tannins in AEB and HLE. In the in vitro
 tests, the extracts inhibited the phospholipase and fibrinolytic activities
 of BaV in the two ratios of venom to extract used. HLE exhibited effective
 antimicrobial action as it inhibited growth of 11 of the 15 bacteria
 investigated, including Morganella morganii, the main bacteria described in
 the oral cavity of snakes. The extracts failed to inhibit the defibrinating
 activity of BaV, and only the Bothrops antivenom had a significant effect
 (96.1%) on this activity. BaV-induced hemorrhage was completely inhibited by
 AEL and AEB when the pre-incubation (venom:extract) protocol was used. When
 administered orally, as in folk medicine, both AEB and AEL produced
 significant inhibition of hemorrhagic activity (maximum inhibition 46.5% and
 39.2%, respectively). SDS-PAGE and WB of the extracts pre-incubated with BaV
 showed that the main proteins in the venom had been precipitated by the
 extracts. None of the four extracts showed cytotoxic effects in the tests
 carried out with a human fibroblast cell line. CONCLUSION: In addition to
 being effective in reducing hemorrhage when administered orally, the extracts
 displayed a high antimicrobial potential against microorganisms involved in
 secondary infections at the site of the snakebite. Once the extracts have
 been tested in accordance with the appropriate regulations, this species
 could potentially be used to produce a phytomedicine for complementary
 treatment of the secondary infections due to bacteria that aggravate the
 local signs and symptoms after snakebite envenomation.",
