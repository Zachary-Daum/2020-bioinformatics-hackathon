    abstract "Importance: Lithium is a first-line mood stabilizer for the
 treatment of bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). However, the efficacy of
 lithium varies widely, with a nonresponse rate of up to 30%. Biological
 response markers are lacking. Genetic factors are thought to mediate
 treatment response to lithium, and there is a previously reported genetic
 overlap between BPAD and schizophrenia (SCZ). Objectives: To test whether a
 polygenic score for SCZ is associated with treatment response to lithium in
 BPAD and to explore the potential molecular underpinnings of this
 association. Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 2586 patients with
 BPAD who had undergone lithium treatment were genotyped and assessed for
 long-term response to treatment between 2008 and 2013. Weighted SCZ polygenic
 scores were computed at different P value thresholds using summary statistics
 from an international multicenter genome-wide association study (GWAS) of
 36989 individuals with SCZ and genotype data from patients with BPAD from the
 Consortium on Lithium Genetics. For functional exploration, a cross-trait
 meta-GWAS and pathway analysis was performed, combining GWAS summary
 statistics on SCZ and response to treatment with lithium. Data analysis was
 performed from September 2016 to February 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures:
 Treatment response to lithium was defined on both the categorical and
 continuous scales using the Retrospective Criteria of Long-Term Treatment
 Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder score. The effect
 measures include odds ratios and the proportion of variance explained.
 Results: Of the 2586 patients in the study (mean [SD] age, 47.2 [13.9]
 years), 1478 were women and 1108 were men. The polygenic score for SCZ was
 inversely associated with lithium treatment response in the categorical
 outcome, at a threshold P < 5 x 10-2. Patients with BPAD who had a low
 polygenic load for SCZ responded better to lithium, with odds ratios for
 lithium response ranging from 3.46 (95% CI, 1.42-8.41) at the first decile to
 2.03 (95% CI, 0.86-4.81) at the ninth decile, compared with the patients in
 the 10th decile of SCZ risk. In the cross-trait meta-GWAS, 15 genetic loci
 that may have overlapping effects on lithium treatment response and
 susceptibility to SCZ were identified. Functional pathway and network
 analysis of these loci point to the HLA antigen complex and inflammatory
 cytokines. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides evidence for a
 negative association between high genetic loading for SCZ and poor response
 to lithium in patients with BPAD. These results suggest the potential for
 translational research aimed at personalized prescribing of lithium.",
