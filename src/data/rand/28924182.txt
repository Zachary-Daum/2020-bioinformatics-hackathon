    abstract "Lissencephaly comprises a spectrum of brain malformations due to
 impaired neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex. Classical
 lissencephaly is characterized by smooth cerebral surface and cortical
 thickening that result in seizures, severe neurological impairment and
 developmental delay. Mutations in the X-chromosomal gene DCX, encoding
 doublecortin, is the main cause of classical lissencephaly. Much of our
 knowledge about DCX-associated lissencephaly comes from post-mortem analyses
 of patient's brains, mainly since animal models with DCX mutations do not
 mimic the disease. In the absence of relevant animal models and patient brain
 specimens, we took advantage of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
 technology to model the disease. We established human iPSCs from two males
 with mutated DCX and classical lissencephaly including smooth brain and
 abnormal cortical morphology. The disease was recapitulated by
 differentiation of iPSC into neural cells followed by expression profiling
 and dissection of DCX-associated functions. Here we show that neural stem
 cells, with absent or reduced DCX protein expression, exhibit impaired
 migration, delayed differentiation and deficient neurite formation. Hence,
 the patient-derived iPSCs and neural stem cells provide a system to further
 unravel the functions of DCX in normal development and disease.",
