    abstract "Alternative splicing of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene
 generates two isoforms, hGRalpha and hGRbeta. hGRbeta functions as a
 dominant-negative regulator of hGRalpha activity and but also has inherent
 transcriptional activity, collectively altering glucocorticoid sensitivity.
 Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 3' UTR of hGRbeta have been associated
 with altered receptor protein expression, glucocorticoid sensitivity, and
 disease risk. Characterization of the hGRbeta G3134T polymorphism has been
 limited to a relatively small, homogenous population. The objective of this
 study was to determine the prevalence of hGRbeta G3134T in a diverse
 population and assess the association of hGRbeta G3134T in this population
 with physiological outcomes. In a prospective cohort study, 3730 genetically
 diverse participants were genotyped for hGRbeta G3134T and four common GR
 polymorphisms. A subset of these participants was evaluated for clinical and
 biochemical measurements. Immortalized human osteosarcoma cells (U-2 OS),
 stably transfected with wild-type or G3134T hGRbeta, were evaluated for
 receptor expression, stability, and genome-wide gene expression.
 Glucocorticoid-mediated gene expression profiles were investigated in primary
 macrophages isolated from participants. In a racially diverse population, the
 minor allele frequency was 74% (50.7% heterozygous carriers and 23.3%
 homozygous minor allele), with a higher prevalence in Caucasian non-Hispanic
 participants. After adjusting for confounding variable, carriers of hGRbeta
 G3134T were more likely to self-report allergies, have higher serum cortisol
 levels, and reduced cortisol suppression in response to low-dose
 dexamethasone. The presence of hGRbeta G3134T in U-2 OS cells increased hGR
 mRNA stability and protein expression. Microarray analysis revealed that the
 presence of the hGRbeta G3134T polymorphism uniquely altered gene expression
 profiles in U-2 OS cells and primary macrophages. hGRbeta G3134T is
 significantly present in the study population and associated with race,
 self-reported disease, and serum levels of glucocorticoids. Underlying these
 health differences may be changes in gene expression driven by altered
 receptor stability.",
