    abstract "BACKGROUND: Uncertainty regarding the suitable amount of
 prescribed ointment and its application by patients may cause insufficient or
 uneconomic health care provision. To address this issue, standardized methods
 and experts' knowledge on the suitable amount and coherent patient's
 elucidation for application of topicals are needed. OBJECTIVES: Presented are
 current data in routine care and scientific evidence on the prescribed amount
 of topical agents as well as its application by patients in dermatological
 care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review was conducted via PubMed
 using the keywords as individual and pooled search terms: ""local therapy"", 
""topical treatment"", ""prescription"", ""amount of ointment needed"", ""invo
lved area"", ""BSA"", ""finger-tip-unit"", ""Rule of Hand"", ""calculated
 dosage"" and ""rule of nines"". We included original studies by manually
 screening title and abstract according to the relevance of the topic.
 RESULTS: The search strategy identified 19 clinical trials. The fingertip
 unit (FTU) is the most frequently used measurement for accurate application
 of external agents. Appropriate prescribed amount is calculated by required
 topical agent per involved surface area. CONCLUSIONS: There is still a need
 for clarification to which extent the optimized amount of ointment is
 prescribed and advice for its application in routine care is given. The FTU
 combined with the ""Rule of Hand"" is an adequate measurement for patient's
 guidance on self-application.",
