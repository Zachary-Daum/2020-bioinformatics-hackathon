    abstract "BACKGROUND: Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells
 have shown promise in the treatment of B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia
 (B-ALL). However, its efficacy in B-ALL patients with extramedullary
 involvement is limited due to poor responses and neurotoxicity. Here, we
 utilized a third generation of CAR T cell vector, which contains the
 Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (ITR) domain of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), to
 generate 1928zT2 T cells targeting CD19, and evaluated the efficacy of
 1928zT2 T cells in relapse or refractory B-ALL patients with extramedullary
 involvement. METHODS: 1928zT2 T cells were generated by 19-28z-TLR2
 lentiviral vector transfection into primary human T lymphocytes. The
 anti-leukemia effect of 1928zT2 T cells were determined by killing assays and
 in xenografts. Three patients diagnosed as relapse or refractory ALL with
 extramedullary involvement were infused with 1928zT2 T cells, and the
 clinical responses were evaluated by BM smear, B-ultrasonography, PET/CT,
 histology, flow cytometry, qPCR, ELISA, and luminex assay. RESULTS: 1928zT2 T
 cells exhibited enhanced effector function against CD19+ leukemic cells in
 vitro and in a xenograft model of human extramedullary leukemia. Notably, the
 1928zT2 T cells eradicated extramedullary leukemia and induced complete
 remission in the three relapse and refractory ALL patients without serious
 adverse effects. 1928zT2 T cells expanded robustly in the circulation of
 these three patients and were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patient
 3. These three patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with
 grade 2 or 3, which remitted spontaneously or after tocilizumab treatment.
 None of the three patients suffered neurotoxicity or needed further intensive
 care. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that 1928zT2 T cells with TLR2
 incorporation augment anti-leukemic effects, particularly for eradicating
 extramedullary leukemia cells, and suggest that the infusion of 1928zT2 T
 cells is an encouraging treatment for relapsed/refractory ALL patients with
 extramedullary involvement. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
