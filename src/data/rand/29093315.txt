    abstract "Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the primary and secondary
 vectors, respectively, of dengue, the most important arboviral disease in the
 world. The aim of this study was to detect and serotype dengue viruses (DENV)
 in the vectors Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Surabaya, Indonesia. Between
 2008 and 2015, 16,605 Aedes mosquitoes were collected in 15 sub-districts of
 Surabaya. Ae. aegypti was dominant (90.9%), whereas few Ae. albopictus were
 collected (9.1%). A total of 330 pools of adult Aedes mosquitoes were
 subjected to the serotyping of DENV by RT-PCR. DENV-1 (52.3%) was the most
 frequently detected serotype, followed by DENV-2 (40.3%), DENV-4 (4.6%), and
 DENV-3 (2.8%). The average minimum infection rate for Ae. aegypti in various
 sub-districts of Surabaya was 7.2 per 1,000 mosquitoes, while that for Ae.
 albopictus was 0.7 per 1,000 mosquitoes. The results showed that the
 predominantly circulating DENV serotype in mosquitoes continuously shifted
 from DENV-2 (2008) to DENV-1 (2009-2012), to DENV-2 again (2013-2014), and
 then back to DENV-1 (2015). The circulating DENV serotypes in mosquitoes were
 generally consistent with those in humans. Therefore, the surveillance of
 infected mosquitoes with DENV might provide an early warning sign for the
 risk of future dengue outbreaks.",
