    abstract "During the first year of life face discrimination abilities
 narrow toward adult human faces of the most frequently encountered ethnic
 group/s. Earlier studies showed that perceptual learning under
 laboratory-training protocols can modulate this narrowing process. Here we
 investigated whether natural experience acquired in everyday settings with an
 older sibling's face can shape the trajectory of perceptual narrowing towards
 adult faces. Using an infant-controlled habituation procedure we measured
 discrimination of adult (Experiment 1) and child faces (Experiment 2) in 3-
 and 9- month-old infants with and without a child sibling. Discrimination of
 adult faces was observed for infants at both ages, although accompanied by
 posthabituation preferences in opposite directions, whereas at both ages the
 discrimination of child faces critically depended on sibling experience.
 These results provide the first evidence that natural experience acquired
 with siblings affects the tuning properties of infant face representation.",
