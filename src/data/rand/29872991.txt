    abstract "A multimillion-dollar boom is achieved every year by the
 ethnopharmaceutical companies, creating awareness around the globe to use
 herbal medicines to stay and live a healthy life. Nearly, two-thirds of the
 plants were discovered for herbal remedies, and some plants are even
 endangered to get extinct from the globe for their repeated utility.
 Sarcostemma brevistigma is one among the undiscovered medicinal plants which
 belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae found distributed in Indian states of
 Bihar, Bengal, Konkan, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. This study was intended to
 determine the antidiabetic property of plant extract of Sarcostemma
 brevistigma evidenced by biochemical parameters, antioxidant activity, with
 the histopathological analysis in diabetic induced mice. Animals that were
 orally treated with the S. brevistigma extract showed blood glucose lowering
 effect when compared to the alloxan-induced mice, i.e., from 391.5 +/- 6.3 to
 193.6 +/- 4.3 mg/dL. There is the significant increase in insulin level (P <
 0.05) (27.97 +/- 1.6 mIU/L) which is comparable to the metformin administered
 test group (30.35 +/- 0.6 mIU/L). A significant difference (P < 0.05) of both
 ALT and AST levels were observed when compared to the other groups. A
 significant increase in antioxidant activity (reduced glutathione,
 malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase) in plant extract administered group
 was observed when compared to the other treatment groups. Histopathological
 studies showed abnormalities in the liver, pancreas, kidney, lungs, heart,
 and spleen of alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The abnormalities were found to
 be normalized to a considerable extent after treatment with S. brevistigma
 extract. The results stood as evidence for S. brevistigma as an active
 antidiabetic herbal plant.",
