    abstract "Purpose: To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of IVIg
 monotherapy in patients with recalcitrant ocular cicatricial pemphigoid
 (OCP). Methods: A chart review of all OCP patients seen at the Massachusetts
 Eye Research and Surgery Institution (MERSI) between 2005 and 2015 was
 completed. Stage was graded by using the Foster grading system. IVIg infusion
 was 2g/kg/cycle administered in 3 consecutive days monthly. Results: Of 512
 OCP patients, 17 patients (34 eyes) treated with IVIg monotherapy were
 identified. Seven were female and ten were male. The average age at diagnosis
 was 60.7-year-old. The follow up time ranged from 12 to 140 months.
 Twenty-six eyes (76.5%) achieved remission. Nine remission eyes received
 cataract surgeries, and 2 of them had relapse (22.2%). The other 17 eyes did
 not undergo ocular surgery and remained in remission. IVIg monotherapy showed
 high efficacy in stage 1 OCP (7/7, 100%). Ocular surgery can be associated
 with OCP relapse (Table 2). Conclusions: IVIg monotherapy is an effective and
 safe therapy in patients with recalcitrant OCP. Ocular surgery can be
 associated with OCP relapse.",
