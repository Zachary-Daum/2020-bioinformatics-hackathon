    abstract "It has been uncovered that chemical dyes are illegally used in
 traditional Chinese medicines to brighten color and cover up inferiority,
 which threaten the safety of patients. In the present study, an HPTLC-MS
 method was developed for the effective screening of 11 chemical dyes (Sudan
 I, II, III, and IV; 808 Scarlet; Sudan Red 7B; malachite green; Basic Orange
 2; auramine; Orange II; and erythrosine) in traditional Chinese medicine
 (TCM) raw materials and Chinese patent medicines. Firstly, unwashed HPTLC
 plates were chosen by comparing the background signals of the TLC plates used
 directly and prewashed with analytical grade and HPLC grade solvents. Twice
 developments were conducted to isolate chemical dyes of different polarity.
 Possible adulterants were preliminarily identified by comparing Rf values and
 in situ UV-Vis spectra with those of the references. Further confirmation was
 conducted by tandem MS analysis via an elution head-based TLC-MS interface.
 Sudan I and IV, 808 Scarlet, and Orange II were successfully detected in
 eight batches of TCM. The proposed method could be applied as a reliable
 technology for the screening of chemical dyes in TCM.",
