    abstract "Receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) is an essential mediator
 of inflammation and innate immunity, but little is known about its role
 outside the immune system. Recently, RIP2 has been linked to chemoresistance
 of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive breast cancer
 subtype for which there is an urgent need for targeted therapies. In this
 study we show that high expression of RIP2 in breast tumors correlates with a
 worse prognosis and a higher risk of recurrence. We also demonstrate that
 RIP2 confers TNBC cell resistance against paclitaxel and ceramide-induced
 apoptosis. Overexpression of RIP2 lead to NF-kappaB activation, which
 contributed to higher expression of pro-survival proteins and cell survival.
 Conversely, RIP2 knockdown inhibited NF-kappaB signaling, reduced levels of
 anti-apoptotic proteins and sensitized cells to drug treatment. Together,
 these data show that RIP2 promotes survival of breast cancer cells through
 NF-kappaB activation and that targeting RIP2 may be therapeutically
 beneficial for treatment of TNBC.",
