    abstract "To control infectious diseases in humans, it is important to
 understand the pathogenicity of the infecting organism(s). Although non-human
 primates, such as cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, have been used for
 influenza virus infection models, their size can limit their use in confined
 animal facilities. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of
 marmosets to influenza viruses to assess the possibility of using these
 animals as a non-human primate model for influenza research. We first used an
 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus to compare two inoculation routes: the
 conventional route, via a combination of the intratracheal, intranasal,
 ocular, and oral routes; and the tracheal spray route. In marmosets
 inoculated via the tracheal spray route, we found inflammation throughout the
 lungs and trachea. In contrast, in marmosets inoculated via the conventional
 route, the inflammation was confined to roughly the center of the lung. These
 data suggest that the tracheal spray route may be more suitable than the
 conventional route to inoculate marmosets with influenza viruses. We also
 tested an influenza A(H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus
 and found that some marmosets inoculated with this virus via the tracheal
 spray route showed weight loss, decreased body temperature, and loss of
 appetite and activity. The replication of this H5N1 virus in respiratory
 organs was confirmed. These results indicate the potential of marmosets as an
 animal model for infection with seasonal or HPAI viruses.",
