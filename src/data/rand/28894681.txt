    abstract "STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
 preoperative computed tomography (CT) myelogram imaging parameters in
 patients diagnosed with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) that correlate
 with severity of DCM and predict postoperative patients' functional outcome.
 METHODS: An electronic database search was performed using Ovid Medline and
 Embase. CT myelogram studies investigating the correlation between imaging
 characteristics and DCM severity or postoperative outcomes were included. Two
 independent reviewers performed citation screening, selection, qualitative
 assessment, and data extraction using an objective and blinded protocol.
 RESULTS: A total of 5 studies (402 patients) were included in this review and
 investigated the role of preoperative CT myelogram parameters in predicting
 the functional outcome after surgical treatment of DCM. All studies were
 retrospective cohort studies. CT myelogram characteristics included the
 transverse area of the spinal cord at maximum level of compression, spinal
 canal narrowing, number of blocks, spinal canal diameter, and flattening
 ratio. There is low evidence suggesting that patients with a preoperative
 transverse area of the spinal cord >30 mm(2) at the level of maximum
 compression have better postoperative recovery and outcome. We found no
 studies investigating the correlation between preoperative CT myelogram
 parameters and DCM severity. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with greater transverse
 area of spinal cord at the level of maximum compression on the preoperative
 CT myelogram are more likely to have better neurological outcome after
 surgery. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that any of the other CT
 myelogram parameters investigated are predictors of postoperative outcomes in
 patients with DCM.",
