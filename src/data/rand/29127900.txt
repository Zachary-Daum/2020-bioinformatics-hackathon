    abstract "We develop a reusable ratiometric electrochemical biosensor on
 the basis of the binding of methylene blue (MB) to DNA with alternating AT
 base sequence for sensitive detection of adenosine. We design a strand 1 with
 MB-modified thymine (T) base in the proximal 3' termini as the capture probe
 for its immobilization on the gold electrode and a 3' termini ferrocene
 (Fc)-modified aptamer for the recognition of adenosine. The hybridization of
 strand 1 with the aptamer leads to the formation of a double-stranded DNA
 (dsDNA) and consequently the away of MB from the electrode surface and the
 close of Fc to the electrode surface, generating a small value of IMB/IFc
 (IMB and IFc are the peak currents of MB and Fc, respectively). In the
 presence of adenosine, its binding with the aptamer induces the release of Fc
 from the electrode surface and the close of MB to the electrode surface,
 generating a large value of IMB/IFc. As a result, adenosine may be accurately
 quantified by the measurement of ratiometric signal (IMB/IFc). This
 ratiometric electrochemical biosensor can be simply fabricated and exhibits
 high sensitivity with a limit of detection of as low as 90.8pM and a large
 dynamic range from 0.1nM to 100muM. Moreover, this biosensor demonstrates
 good performance with excellent selectivity, regeneration capability, high
 reliability and good reproducibility, and may become a universal platform for
 the detection of various biomolecules which can be recognized by aptamers,
 holding great potential for further applications in biomedical research and
 clinical diagnosis.",
