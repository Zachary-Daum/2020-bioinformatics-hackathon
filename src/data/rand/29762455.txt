    abstract "BACKGROUND: Lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) remains an
 important factor for the early mortality of lung transplantations. Hydrogen
 (H2) can attenuate lung injury and improve lung function in animal
 experiments. In previous studies, pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells
 (PMVECs) were used to simulate LIRI. We hypothesized that H2 can alleviate
 inflammatory injury in a PMVECs lung transplantation model in the cold
 ischemia phase. METHODS: Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were
 divided into 4 groups: blank, control, oxygen (O2), and H2. The blank group
 included PMVECs without treatment. During the cold storage period, the O2
 group was aerated with 40% O2 and 60% N2, and the H2 group was aerated with
 3% H2, 40% O2, and 57% N2. The control group was aerated without gases. The
 mixed gases were replaced every 20 minutes for 4 hours. During the
 transplantation period, the sealed containers were warmed for 1 hour at room
 temperature. In the reperfusion period, the containers were aerated with 50%
 O2, 5% CO2 and 45% N2 at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: The concentrations of
 interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the extracellular solutions
 were significantly decreased, and the concentration of interleukin-10 was
 increased in the H2 group. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression was
 inhibited by H2. Furthermore, H2 decreased the activation of NF-kappaB and
 phosphorylation level of p38. Cell apoptosis was alleviated. The pathological
 changes in the cell and mitochondria were alleviated after H2 administration.
 CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogen-attenuated inflammatory response in a PMVECs lung
 transplantation model during cold storage. The effect may be achieved by
 inhibition of p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways.",
