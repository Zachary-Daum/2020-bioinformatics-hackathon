    abstract "For the first time, NCCN has published guidelines specifically
 geared toward treating myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The first set of
 guidelines was developed for myelofibrosis (MF), and was presented at the
 NCCN 22nd Annual Conference. Future guidelines will be issued for
 polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytopenia, and atypical MPNs. Patients
 with MF can have an unpredictable course, one that is largely dependent on
 the presence of certain molecular alterations. Models are currently emerging
 that take into account molecular factors. Only one drug is currently approved
 for MF, the oral JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, which has been shown to
 significantly reduce splenomegaly and improve symptoms.",
