    abstract "CONTEXT: Little is known about how parents of children with
 advanced cancer classify news they receive about their child's medical
 condition. OBJECTIVE: To develop concepts of ""good news"" and ""bad news""
 in discussions of advanced childhood cancer from parent perspectives.
 METHODS: Parents of children with advanced cancer cared for at three children
's hospitals were asked to share details of conversations in the preceding
 three months that contained ""good news"" or ""bad news"" related to their
 child's medical condition. We used mixed methods to evaluate parent responses
 to both open-ended and fixed-response items. RESULTS: Of 104 enrolled
 parents, 86 (83%) completed the survey. Six (7%) parents reported discussing
 neither good nor bad news, 18 (21%) reported only bad news, 15 (17%) reported
 only good news, and 46 (54%) reported both good and bad news (one missing
 response). Seventy-six parents (88%) answered free-response items.
 Descriptions of both good and bad news discussions consisted predominantly of
 ""tumor talk"" or cancer control. Additional treatment options featured
 prominently, particularly in discussions of bad news (42%). Child well-being,
 an important good news theme, encompassed treatment tolerance, symptom
 reduction, and quality of life. CONCLUSION: A majority of parents of children
 with advanced cancer report discussing both good and bad news in the
 preceding three months. Although news related primarily to cancer control,
 parents also describe good news discussions related to their child's
 well-being. Understanding how parents of children with advanced cancer
 classify and describe the news they receive may enhance efforts to promote
 family-centered communication.",
