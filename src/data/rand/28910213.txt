    abstract "While the DSM-5 alternative model of personality disorder (PD)
 diagnosis allows the field to systematically compare categorical and
 dimensional classifications, the ICD-11 proposal suggests a radical change by
 restricting the classification of PDs to one category, deleting all specific
 types, basing clinical service provision exclusively upon a severity
 dimension, and restricting trait domains to secondary qualifiers without
 defining cutoff points. This article reflects broad international agreement
 about the state of PD diagnosis. It is argued that diagnosis according to the
 ICD-11 proposal is based on broad, potentially stigmatizing descriptions of
 impaired functioning and ignores much of the impressive body of research and
 treatment guidelines that have advanced the care of adults and adolescents
 with borderline and other PDs. Before radically changing classification,
 which highly impacts the provision of health care, head-to-head field trials
 coupled with the views of patients as well as thorough debate among
 scientists are urgently needed.",
