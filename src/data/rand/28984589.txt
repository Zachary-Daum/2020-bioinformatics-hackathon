    abstract "BACKGROUND: Dementia is a growing concern for low- and
 middle-income countries where longevity is increasing and service provision
 is poor. Global prevalence estimates vary from 2% to 8.5% for those aged 60
 years and older. There have been few dementia studies in sub-Saharan Africa,
 and prevalence data are lacking for South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a
 large dementia prevalence study in a low income rural population in South
 Africa. METHODS: 1,394 Xhosa-speaking community dwellers, aged >/=60 y (mean
 age+/-sd 71.3+/-8.3 y), in three clinic catchment areas, were screened at
 home. Trained community health workers administered the brief Community
 Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSID) to participants and informants to
 assess cognitive and functional capacity. Depressive symptoms were assessed
 with three questions from the EURO-D. RESULTS: The prevalence estimate using
 published CSID sensitivity/specificity values was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.06-0.09).
 Using CSID cut-off scores the estimated prevalence was 0.12 (95% CI:
 0.10-0.13), with 161 screen-positives. Both methods gave a rate of 0.11 (95%
 CI: 0.09-0.13) for those over 65 years (n = 1051). 68.6% of participants were
 female and 69.8% had less than 7 years of education. Dementia risk was
 associated with older age and symptoms of depression, but not with sex. The
 association with education was not significant when controlled for by age.
 CONCLUSIONS: Dementia prevalence estimates were higher than expected for this
 low-income rural community. There is a need for increased dementia awareness
 and feasible support interventions. We also need further studies of regional
 prevalences, dementia subtypes, and modifiable risk factors in South Africa.",
