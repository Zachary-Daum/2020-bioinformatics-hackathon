    abstract "Modern rectal cancer management is dependent on preoperative
 staging, and radiological assessment is a crucial part of this process.
 Imaging must provide sufficient information to guide preoperative
 decision-making that is reliable and reproducible. Different methods have
 been used for local staging; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has
 shown to be the most reliable tool for this purpose. MRI offers prognostic
 information about the patients and guides the decision between neoadjuvant
 treatment and total mesorectal excision alone. Also, not only the initial
 staging but also restaging by MRI can provide significant information
 regarding tumor response that is essential when considering alternative
 approaches.",
