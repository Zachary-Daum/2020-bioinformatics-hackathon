    abstract "OBJECTIVE: This study sought to describe safety and efficiency
 outcomes for patients undergoing procedures at the Women's Health Centre, an
 outpatient gynaecological surgical centre in Saskatoon, SK. METHODS: A
 retrospective chart review of surgical outpatient health records was
 conducted for the period of July 2014 to June 2015. Data were abstracted
 using a standardized data form for patient admissions during the study
 period. Primary outcomes of interest included procedure time, lead time
 (registration to discharge), complication rates, readmission rates, and
 reoperation rates. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Microsoft
 Excel and were summarized using frequencies and percentages. The
 Kruskal-Wallis test was performed for lead time and procedural time by using
 IBM SPSS Statistics 24 software (IBM, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: During the study
 period, 1720 patients were seen by 21 providers. The mean number of patients
 seen per month was 144. The main services provided include hysteroscopic
 sterilization, non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation, loop electrosurgical
 excision procedure, hysteroscopy, and therapeutic abortion. Pain management
 was administered by local anaesthetic and/or conscious sedation. The mean
 procedure time was 10 +/- 6 minutes, whereas the lead time was 171 +/- 43
 minutes. Immediate complications occurred in 3.9% of patients, the most
 common being vaginal bleeding (1.3%). The long-term complication rate was
 5.1%, with the most common complication being reoperation in the main
 operating room, at 2.9%. CONCLUSION: Currently, many gynaecological
 procedures in Canada occur in a formal operating theatre setting. Our study
 demonstrates the safety and efficiency of an alternate setting where
 gynaecological procedures are performed on an outpatient basis by using local
 anaesthetic and conscious sedation.",
