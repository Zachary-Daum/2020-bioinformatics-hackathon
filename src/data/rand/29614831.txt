    abstract "The workplace is an ideal setting for health promotion. The
 regular medical examination of workers enables us to screen for numerous
 diseases, spread good practices and correct lifestyles, and obtain a
 favourable risk/benefit ratio. The continuous monitoring of the level of
 workers' wellbeing using a holistic approach during medical surveillance
 enables us to promptly identify problems in work organisation and the company
 climate. Problems of this kind can be adequately managed by using a
 participatory approach. The aim of this paper is twofold: to signal this way
 of proceeding with medical surveillance, and to describe an organisational
 development intervention. Participatory groups were used to improve
 occupational life in a small company. After intervention we observed a
 reduction in levels of perceived occupational stress measured with the
 Effort/Reward Imbalance questionnaire, and an improvement in psychological
 wellbeing assessed by means of the Goldberg Anxiety/Depression scale.
 Although the limited size of the sample and the lack of a control group call
 for a cautious evaluation of this study, the participatory strategy proved to
 be a useful tool due to its cost-effectiveness.",
