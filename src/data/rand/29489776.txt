    abstract "Interferenceless coded aperture correlation holography (I-COACH)
 is an incoherent digital holography technique developed to record and
 reconstruct 3D images of objects without two-wave interference. Herein, we
 introduce a novel technique to extend the field of view (FOV) of I-COACH
 beyond the limit imposed by the ratio between the finite area of the image
 sensor and the magnification of the optical system. Light diffracted from a
 point object located on the optical axis is modulated by a pseudorandom coded
 phase mask, and the central part of the point spread hologram (PSH) on the
 image sensor is recorded. The point object is shifted laterally to
 predetermined lateral locations in order to collect the exterior parts of the
 PSH. The recorded PSHs are stitched together to produce a synthetic PSH
 (SPSH) with an area nine times that of any individual PSH recorded by the
 image sensor. An object with a lateral extent beyond the FOV limit of the
 image sensor is placed at the same axial location as the point object, and
 the object hologram is recorded. The object is reconstructed by a
 cross-correlation between the zero-padded object hologram and the SPSH.
 Hence, the object parts beyond the FOV limit of the image sensor are
 recovered. An SPSH library is created for different axial planes, and the
 corresponding axial planes of the object are reconstructed.",
