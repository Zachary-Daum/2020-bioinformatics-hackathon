    abstract "Neuroinflammatory changes have been demonstrated to be an
 important feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the exact role of
 neuroinflammation and its progression during disease is still not well
 understood. One of the main drivers of the neuroinflammatory process are
 microglial cells. Positron Emission Tomography allows for the quantification
 of microglial activation by labelling the Translocator Protein 18kDa (TSPO),
 which becomes overexpressed upon activation of microglial cells. Several
 radioligands have been designed to target TSPO and have been studied in-vivo
 in AD populations. While most studies have shown important increases in TSPO
 binding in AD populations compared to healthy volunteers, whether the
 neuroinflammatory progress occurs early on or later during disease is still
 unclear. In order to investigate the early changes in neuroinflammation,
 studies have sought to investigate microglial activation in patients with
 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is defined as a transitional stage
 between normal aging and dementia. In this prodromal population, conflicting
 results have been reported with some studies reporting increased binding in
 MCI, while others demonstrate no differences from controls. Here we review
 the TSPO PET studies in AD and MCI populations and discuss the important
 methodological considerations of imaging microglial activation.",
