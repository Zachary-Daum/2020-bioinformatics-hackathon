    abstract "BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common
 neoplasm of the adult kidney. miR-210 was a known oncogene with
 tumor-promoting effects in many types of cancer. This meta-analysis aimed to
 evaluate the potential diagnostic value of circulating miR-210. METHODS:
 Relevant literature was collected from PubMed and Embase. Sensitivity,
 specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for miR-210 in the diagnosis of
 RCC were pooled using random effects models. Summary receiver operating
 characteristic (SROC) curve analysis and the area under the curve (AUC) were
 used to estimate the overall test performance. RESULTS: This meta-analysis
 included seven studies with a total of 570 RCC patients and 415 healthy
 controls. For miR-210, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR to
 predict RCC patients were 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70 - 0.77),
 0.76 (95% CI: 0.71 - 0.80) and 8.81 (95% CI: 5.31 - 14.57), respectively. In
 addition, the AUC of miR-210 for the diagnosis of RCC is 0.81. CONCLUSIONS:
 MiR-210 might be a potential novel biomarker in the diagnosis of renal cell
 carcinoma.",
