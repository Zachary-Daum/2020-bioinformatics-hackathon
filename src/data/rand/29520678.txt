    abstract "Bulbocavernosus reflex (BCR) monitoring is used to assess the
 integrity of urinary and bowel function. In this study, we evaluated the
 feasibility of BCR monitoring during untethering surgery in infants and
 children to predict postoperative urinary and bowel dysfunction. The records
 of 22 patients ranging from 4 days to 10 years old (mean 2.7 +/- 3.3 years)
 were reviewed. Anesthesia was maintained by propofol or sevoflurane/opioid
 without neuromuscular blockade. BCR waveforms induced by electrical
 stimulation (20-40 mA, train-of-four pulses with 500 Hz) to the penis or
 clitoris were recorded from bilateral external anal sphincters. To assess the
 sensitivity and specificity of BCR monitoring, we investigated the
 association between a significant continuous decrease in BCR amplitude at the
 end of surgery and postoperative urinary and bowel dysfunction after surgery.
 Reproducible baseline BCR waveforms were successfully recorded in 20 of 22
 patients (90.9%). A significant continuous decrease in BCR amplitude was
 observed in 8 patients. The results of intraoperative BCR monitoring included
 three true-positives, twelve true-negatives, five false-positives, and zero
 false-negatives. Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of BCR monitoring
 used to predict postoperative urinary and bowel dysfunction were 100 and
 70.6%, respectively. BCR monitoring during untethering surgery in infants and
 children under general anesthesia was found to be a feasible method to
 prevent postoperative urinary and bowel dysfunction.",
