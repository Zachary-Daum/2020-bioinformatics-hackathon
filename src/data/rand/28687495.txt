    abstract "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived membrane vesicles
 virtually secreted by all cells, including brain cells. EVs are a major term
 that includes apoptotic bodies, microvesicles and exosomes. The release of
 EVs has been recognized as an important modulator in cross-talking between
 neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes, not only in central
 nervous system (CNS) physiology but also in neurodegenerative and
 neuroinflammatory disease states as well as in brain tumors, such as glioma.
 EVs are able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), spread to body fluids
 and reach distant tissues. This prominent spreading ability has suggested
 that EVs can be exploited into several different clinical applications
 ranging from biomarkers to therapeutic carriers. Exosomes, the well-studied
 group of EVs, have been emerging as a promising tool for therapeutic delivery
 strategies due to their intrinsic features, such as the stability,
 biocompatibility and stealth capacity when circulating in bloodstream, the
 ability to overcome natural barriers and inherent targeting properties. Over
 the last years, it became apparent that EVs can be loaded with specific
 cargoes directly in isolated EVs or by modulation of producer cells. In
 addition, the engineering of its membrane for targeting purposes is expected
 to allow generating carriers with unprecedented abilities for delivery in
 specific organs or tissues. Nevertheless, some challenges remain regarding
 the loading and targeting of EVs for which more research is necessary, and
 will be discussed in this review. Recently-emerged promising derivations are
 also discussed, such as exosome associated with adeno-associated virus (AAV)
 vectors (vexosomes), enveloped protein nanocages (EPNs) and exosome-mimetic
 nanovesicles. This article provides an updated review of this
 fast-progressing field of EVs and their role in brain diseases, particularly
 focusing in their therapeutic applications.",
