    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of various
 guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis using computed
 tomography (CT) in patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT). METHODS:
 In total, 216 patients who underwent preoperative CT and subsequent LT were
 included. Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated focal hepatic lesions
 independently according to various guidelines and allocated patients
 according to the Milan criteria. The diagnostic performance of the guidelines
 was compared using alternative free-response receiver-operating
 characteristics (AFROC) analysis with bootstrapping. Comparisons of
 sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of patient allocation based on the
 Milan criteria between guidelines were performed using logistic regression
 with generalized estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS: Fifty-two of 216
 patients had 87 HCCs. The reader-averaged figure of merit obtained using
 AFROC analysis was 0.738 for the AASLD/EASL or KLCSG-NCC guidelines and 0.728
 for the LI-RADS v2014 or OPTN/UNOS (bootstrapping, p = 0.005). The per-lesion
 sensitivity for HCCs (all and 1-2-cm lesions) was significantly higher with
 the AASLD/EASL (37.9-41.4% and 30.8-41.0%) than with LI-RADS (28.7% and
 15.4-18.0%) (logistic regression with GEE, p = 0.008 and 0.030 for reader 1
 and p = 0.005 for reader 2). The per-patient specificity (98.8-99.4%) was the
 same for all guidelines. The accuracy of the Milan criteria was 81.5-83.3%
 without significant differences among the four guidelines (logistic
 regression with GEE, p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: AASLD/EASL showed higher
 diagnostic performance and sensitivity, particularly for 1-2-cm HCCs, and the
 same specificity with LI-RADS. All guidelines are comparable for patient
 allocation based on the Milan criteria for LT. KEY POINTS: * The overall
 diagnostic performance of CT for HCC diagnosis was highest with AASLD/EASL. *
 AASLD/EASL showed higher sensitivity for diagnosis of 1-2-cm HCCs than
 LI-RADS. * The accuracy of the Milan criteria using CT was comparable among
 the four guidelines.",
