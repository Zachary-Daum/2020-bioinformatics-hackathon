    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Following nasal hump removal during
 septorhinoplasty, the middle vault should be reconstructed to avoid
 functional and esthetic problems. Middle vault reconstruction, however, may
 result in widening of the middle vault and may need a camouflage graft to
 cover dorsal irregularities. OBJECTIVE: To present the results of
 reconstructing the middle vault with a technique that covers the nasal dorsum
 with upper lateral cartilage, from the viewpoint of patient satisfaction.
 METHODS: Retrospective study of patients who underwent septorhinoplasty that
 included nasal dorsum closure with upper lateral cartilage from December 1,
 2014 to January 31, 2016. Those with postoperative follow-up of less than 3
 months were excluded. The final study group included 39 patients. The same
 surgeon performed all septorhinoplasties. The dorsum was closed using an ""up
per lateral closing"" technique that approximated upper lateral cartilages to
 each other over the septum. Postoperative patient satisfaction was determined
 using a visual analog scale and the rhinoplasty outcomes evaluation
 questionnaire. The questionnaire evaluates patient esthetic and functional
 satisfaction with the operated nose. High scores indicate improved esthetic
 results. RESULTS: No dorsal irregularities were seen at postoperative
 follow-up evaluation of the patients. For esthetic nasal appearance, the
 median visual analogue scale scores was 86%, and the mean for the
 questionnaire was 77.03%. CONCLUSION: The natural dome-shaped anatomy of the
 nasal dorsum was achieved by approximating the upper lateral cartilages to
 each other. Closing the dorsum with this technique also covers any dorsal
 irregularities and results in a smooth dorsum. Patients expressed
 satisfaction with the esthetic and functional aspects of the smooth,
 attractive nasal dorsum.",
