    abstract "OBJECTIVE: The time taken to reach maximal haemostatic effect
 following local anaesthesia with epinephrine is generally believed to be <10
 min. This is based on clinical experience and indirect measurements of
 perfusion using methods such as laser Doppler flowmetry and oxygen
 spectroscopy. However, the only study in which bleeding has been measured
 quantitatively in an intra-operative setting in humans showed that the full
 haemostatic effect was not achieved until 30 min after anaesthesia. The aim
 of this study was to determine the time taken to reach maximum haemostatic
 effect when using epinephrine for local anaesthesia in oculoplastic surgery.
 METHODS: Intra-operative bleeding following infiltration anaesthesia with
 either lidocaine 20 mg/ml (2%) or lidocaine + epinephrine 12.5 mug/ml (1:80
 000) was measured after 7, 15 and 30 min in the eyelids of 16 patients
 undergoing upper eyelid blepharoplasty. RESULTS: Bleeding was decreased by
 74.6% (with 95% CI, 6.16-87.6%) 7 min after the injection of lidocaine +
 epinephrine (p = 0.0048) compared with lidocaine without epinephrine. There
 was no further decrease in bleeding after 15 or 30 min (p = n.s.).
 CONCLUSION: The optimal time for skin incision in eyelid surgery is within 7
 min of injection of lidocaine with epinephrine. Waiting longer does not lead
 to a further decrease in bleeding.",
