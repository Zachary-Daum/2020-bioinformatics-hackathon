    abstract "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has a tremendous impact on the
 quality of life of humans. While experimental animals are valuable to medical
 research as models of human diseases, cardiac systems differ widely across
 various animal species. Thus, we examined a CVD model in cynomolgus monkeys.
 Laboratory primates are precious resources, making it imperative that
 symptoms of diseases and disorders are detected as early as possible. Thus,
 in this study we comprehensively examined important indicators of CVD in
 cynomolgus monkeys, including arterial blood gas, complete blood count (CBC),
 biochemistry and cardiac hormones. The control group included 20 healthy
 macaques showing non-abnormal findings in screening tests, whereas the CVD
 group included 20 macaques with valvular disease and cardiomyopathy. An
 increase of red blood cell distribution width was observed in the CBC,
 indicating chronic inflammation related to CVD. An increase of HCO3 was
 attributed to the correction of acidosis. Furthermore, development of the CVD
 model was supported by significant increases in natriuretic peptides. It is
 suggested that these results indicated a correlation between human CVD and
 the model in monkeys. Moreover, blood tests including arterial blood gas are
 non-invasive and can be performed more easily than other technical tests. CVD
 affected animals easily change their condition by anesthesia and surgical
 invasion. Pay attention to arterial blood gas and proper respond to their
 condition are important for research. This data may facilitate human research
 and aid in the management and veterinary care of nonhuman primates.",
