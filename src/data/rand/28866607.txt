    abstract "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: There are few studies on the value of
 authoring questions as a study method, the quality of the questions produced
 by students and student perceptions of student-authored question banks. Here
 we evaluate PeerWise, a widely used and free online resource that allows
 students to author, answer and discuss multiple-choice questions. STUDY
 DESIGN: We introduced two undergraduate medical student cohorts to PeerWise
 (n=603). We looked at their patterns of PeerWise usage; identified
 associations between student engagement and summative exam performance; and
 used focus groups to assess student perceptions of the value of PeerWise for
 learning. We undertook item analysis to assess question difficulty and
 quality. RESULTS: Over two academic years, the two cohorts wrote 4671
 questions, answered questions 606 658 times and posted 7735 comments.
 Question writing frequency correlated most strongly with summative
 performance (Spearman's rank: 0.24, p=<0.001). Student focus groups found
 that: (1) students valued curriculum specificity; and (2) students were
 concerned about student-authored question quality. Only two questions of the
 300 'most-answered' questions analysed had an unacceptable discriminatory
 value (point-biserial correlation <0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Item analysis suggested
 acceptable question quality despite student concerns. Quantitative and
 qualitative methods indicated that PeerWise is a valuable study tool.",
