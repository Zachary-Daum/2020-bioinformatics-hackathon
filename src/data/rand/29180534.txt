    abstract "BACKGROUND: In the 1990s, California led the USA in state-level
 tobacco control strategies. However, after 2000, California lost ground on
 cigarette taxes, although it maintained higher levels of smoke-free homes
 among smokers. METHODS: Trends in per capita cigarette consumption were
 assessed through taxed sales data and from self-report in repeated national
 cross-sectional surveys. Linear regressions identified changes in trends
 after year 2000 separately for California and the rest of the USA. Using data
 from each state, a linear regression tested the association between different
 tobacco control strategies and per capita consumption. Change in
 self-reported per capita consumption was partitioned into contributions
 associated with initiation, quitting and reduction in cigarette consumption
 level. RESULTS: Both taxed cigarette sales and per capita consumption
 declined rapidly in the USA from 1985 to 2015. Declines were particularly
 fast in California before 2000 but slowed thereafter. In 2014, per capita
 consumption in California was 29.4 packs/adult/year, but 90% higher in the
 rest of the USA. Modelling state-level data, every $1 increase in cigarette
 taxes reduced consumption by 4.8 (95% CI 2.9 to 6.8) packs/adult/year. Every
 5% increase in the proportion of smokers with smoke-free homes reduced
 consumption by 8.0 (95% CI 7.0 to 8.9) packs/adult/year. The different
 patterns in California and the rest of the USA are at least partially
 explained by these two variables. The slow down in per capita consumption in
 California can be attributed to changes in initiation, quitting and
 especially smokers reducing their consumption level. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco
 control strategies need to be continually updated to maintain momentum
 towards a smoke-free society.",
