    abstract "Sodium dual-ion batteries (NDIBs) are attracting extensive
 attention recently because of their low cost and abundant sodium resources.
 However, the low capacity of the carbonaceous anode would reduce the energy
 density, and the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the
 anode during the initial cycles will lead to large amount consumption of
 Na(+) in the electrolyte, which results in low Coulombic efficiency and
 inferior stability of the NDIBs. To address these issues, a phosphorus-doped
 soft carbon (P-SC) anode combined with a presodiation process is developed to
 enhance the performance of the NDIBs. The phosphorus atom doping could
 enhance the electric conductivity and further improve the sodium storage
 property. On the other hand, an SEI could preform in the anode during the
 presodiation process; thus the anode has no need to consume large amounts of
 Na(+) to form the SEI during the cycling of the NDIBs. Consequently, the
 NDIBs with P-SC anode after the presodiation process exhibit high Coulombic
 efficiency (over 90%) and long cycle stability (81 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA
 g(-1) after 900 cycles with capacity retention of 81.8%), far more superior
 to the unsodiated NDIBs. This work may provide guidance for developing high
 performance NDIBs in the future.",
