    abstract "Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy can provide molecular
 fingerprint information with ultrahigh spatial resolution, but the tip will
 be easily contaminated, thus leading to artifacts. It also remains a great
 challenge to establish tip-enhanced fluorescence because of the quenching
 resulting from the proximity of the metal tip. Herein, we report
 shell-isolated tip-enhanced Raman and fluorescence spectroscopies by
 employing ultrathin shell-isolated tips fabricated by atomic layer
 deposition. Such shell-isolated tips not only show outstanding
 electromagnetic field enhancement in TERS but also exclude interference by
 contaminants, thus greatly promoting applications in solution. Tip-enhanced
 fluorescence has also been achieved using these shell-isolated tips, with
 enhancement factors of up to 1.7x10(3) , consistent with theoretical
 simulations. Furthermore, tip-enhanced Raman and fluorescence signals are
 acquired simultaneously, and their relative intensities can be manipulated by
 changing the shell thickness. This work opens a new avenue for ultrahigh
 resolution surface analysis using plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies.",
