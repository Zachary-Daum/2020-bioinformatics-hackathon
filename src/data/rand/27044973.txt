    abstract "Report cards currently published by the Centers for Medicare and
 Medicaid Services (CMS) offer composite (summary) quality measures based on a
 five-star ratings system, such as the one featured on the Nursing Home
 Compare website. These ratings are ""one size fits all patients"" measures.
 Nursing Home Compare Plus is an alternative that allows patients and their
 families to create their own composite scores based on their own preferences
 and medical needs. We present data from 146 patients who were discharged from
 the hospital to nursing homes who used Nursing Home Compare Plus. We found
 that the individual patient-constructed composites differed from CMS's
 five-star ratings composite. Patients differed from each other and from CMS
 in the number of performance measures they chose to include in their
 composite and in their weighting of each performance measure. When comparing
 Nursing Home Compare Plus to Medicare's five-star ratings, we found only
 minimal agreement on ranking of nursing homes. We conclude that patients
 might benefit if current report cards are modified to include an option for
 personalized ranking. ",
