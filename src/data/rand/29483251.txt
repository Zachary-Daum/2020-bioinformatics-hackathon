    abstract "Chemical cues presented on the adhesive substrate direct cell
 migration, a process termed haptotaxis. To migrate, cells must generate
 traction forces upon the substrate. However, how cells probe substrate-bound
 cues and generate directional forces for migration remains unclear. Here, we
 show that the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) L1-CAM is involved in
 laminin-induced haptotaxis of axonal growth cones. L1-CAM underwent grip and
 slip on the substrate. The ratio of the grip state was higher on laminin than
 on the control substrate polylysine; this was accompanied by an increase in
 the traction force upon laminin. Our data suggest that the directional force
 for laminin-induced growth cone haptotaxis is generated by the grip and slip
 of L1-CAM on the substrates, which occur asymmetrically under the growth
 cone. This mechanism is distinct from the conventional cell signaling models
 for directional cell migration. We further show that this mechanism is
 disrupted in a human patient with L1-CAM syndrome, suffering corpus callosum
 agenesis and corticospinal tract hypoplasia.",
