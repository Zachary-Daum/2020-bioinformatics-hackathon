    abstract "RATIONALE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) with hyperparathyroidism
 caused by nitrite was rare, and renal function and parathyroid hormone (PTH)
 decreased to normal range after therapy. PATIENT CONCERNS: Acute kidney
 injury was diagnosed in a 40-year-old male with hyperparathyroidism and
 cyanosis of his hands and both forearms. DIAGNOSES: The patient ate some
 recently pickled vegetables, and he experienced nausea, vomiting and
 diarrhoea without oliguria or anuria; Additionally, his hands and both
 forearms had a typical blue ash appearance. After admission, the laboratory
 findings indicated theincreasing serum creatinine (Scr) and parathyroid
 hormone (PTH). He was diagnosed as acute kidney injury with
 hyperparathyroidism caused by nitrite. INTERVENTIONS: The patient stopped
 eating the pickled vegetables and was given rehydration, added calories and
 other supportive therapy without any glucocorticoids. OUTCOMES: According to
 his clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and imaging results, the
 patient was diagnosed with acute kidney injury with secondary
 hyperparathyroidism. He was given symptomatic supportive care therapy. After
 one week, the serum creatinine, parathyroid hormone (PTH), hypercalcemia,
 hyperphosphatemia, proteinuria, and urine red blood cell values decreased to
 normal range. LESSONS: Nitrite-induced acute kidney injury with secondary
 hyperparathyroidism was relatively rare. After therapy, the function of the
 kidney and parathyroid returned to normal. This case suggests that detailed
 collection of medical history, physical examination and correct symptomatic
 treatment is very important.",
