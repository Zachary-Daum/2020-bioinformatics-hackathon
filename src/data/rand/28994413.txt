    abstract "Automated sample changers are now standard equipment for modern
 macromolecular crystallography synchrotron beamlines. Nevertheless, most are
 only compatible with a single type of sample holder and puck. Recent work
 aimed at reducing sample-handling efforts and crystal-alignment times at
 beamlines has resulted in a new generation of compact and precise sample
 holders for cryocrystallography: miniSPINE and NewPin [see the companion
 paper by Papp et al. (2017, Acta Cryst., D73, 829-840)]. With full data
 collection now possible within seconds at most advanced beamlines, and future
 fourth-generation synchrotron sources promising to extract data in a few tens
 of milliseconds, the time taken to mount and centre a sample is
 rate-limiting. In this context, a versatile and fast sample changer, FlexED8,
 has been developed that is compatible with the highly successful SPINE sample
 holder and with the miniSPINE and NewPin sample holders. Based on a six-axis
 industrial robot, FlexED8 is equipped with a tool changer and includes a
 novel open sample-storage dewar with a built-in ice-filtering system. With
 seven versatile puck slots, it can hold up to 112 SPINE sample holders in
 uni-pucks, or 252 miniSPINE or NewPin sample holders, with 36 samples per
 puck. Additionally, a double gripper, compatible with the SPINE sample
 holders and uni-pucks, allows a reduction in the sample-exchange time from 40
 s, the typical time with a standard single gripper, to less than 5 s.
 Computer vision-based sample-transfer monitoring, sophisticated error
 handling and automatic error-recovery procedures ensure high reliability. The
 FlexED8 sample changer has been successfully tested under real conditions on
 a beamline.",
