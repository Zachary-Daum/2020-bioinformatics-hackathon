    abstract "Prior knowledge is proposed to support the consolidation of
 newly acquired material. The current study examined whether children with
 superior vocabulary knowledge show enhanced overnight consolidation,
 particularly when new words are encountered in varying stories. Children aged
 10 and 11years (N=42) were exposed to two sets of eight spoken novel words
 (e.g., ""crocodol""), with one set embedded in the same story presented twice
 and the other presented in two different stories. Children with superior
 vocabulary knowledge showed larger overnight gains in explicit phonological
 and semantic knowledge when novel words had been encountered in multiple
 stories. However, when novel words had been encountered in repetitive
 stories, existing knowledge exerted no influence on the consolidation of
 explicit phonological knowledge and had a negative impact on the
 consolidation of semantic knowledge. One full day (24h) after story exposure,
 only very weak evidence of lexical integration (i.e., slower animacy
 decisions toward the basewords [e.g., ""crocodile""] than toward the control
 words) was observed for novel words learned via repetitive (but not multiple)
 stories. These data suggest that although the consolidation of explicit new
 word knowledge learned through multiple contexts is supported by prior
 knowledge, lexical integration might benefit more from repetition.",
