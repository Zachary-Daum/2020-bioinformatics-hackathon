    abstract "PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of a vessel removal algorithm in
 segmentation of subsolid nodules by comparing the software solid component
 measurement on CT, before and after vessel removal, with the measurement of
 the invasive component on pathology in lung adenocarcinomas manifesting as
 subsolid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2014 and June 2015,
 73 subsolid nodules with an invasive component of </=10mm on pathology were
 selected for analyses. For each nodule, semi-automated segmentation was
 performed by 2 radiologists and 3-dimensional (D) longest, axial longest and
 effective diameters of solid component were obtained from software, before
 and after using a vessel removal tool. These measurements were compared with
 the invasive component diameter on pathology using the paired t-test and
 Pearson's correlation test. RESULTS: Sixty-eight successfully segmented
 subsolid nodules were included. The mean maximal diameter of the invasive
 component on pathology was 4.6mm (range, 0-10mm). The correlation between
 software and pathology measurements was significant (p<0.01) and the
 correlation after vessel removal (r=0.49-0.54) was better than before vessel
 removal (r=0.27-0.41). The mean measurement difference between solid
 component on CT and invasive tumor on pathology was significantly larger
 before vessel removal than after vessel removal in all measurements. The
 smallest mean measurement difference was obtained with 3D longest diameter of
 solid component after vessel removal in both readers (-0.26mm to 0.10mm),
 with no significant difference from pathology (p=0.53-0.83). CONCLUSION: By
 adding a vessel removal algorithm in software segmentation of subsolid
 nodules, the prediction of invasive component in lung adenocarcinomas can be
 improved.",
