    abstract "Water scarcity footprinting now has a consensual life cycle
 impact assessment indicator recommended by the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle
 Initiative called AWaRe. It was used in this study to calculate the water
 scarcity footprint of New Zealand (NZ) milk produced in two contrasting
 regions; ""non-irrigated moderate rainfall"" (Waikato) and ""irrigated low
 rainfall"" (Canterbury). Two different spatial and temporal resolutions for
 the inventory flows and characterisation factors (CFs) were tested and
 compared: country and annual vs. regional and monthly resolution. An
 inventory of all the consumed water flows was carried out from cradle to
 farm-gate, i.e. from the production of dairy farm inputs to the milk and meat
 leaving the dairy farm, including all water uses on-farm such as irrigation
 water, cow drinking water and cleaning water. The results clearly showed the
 potential overestimation of a water scarcity footprint when using aggregated
 CFs. Impacts decreased by 74% (Waikato) and 33% (Canterbury) when regional
 and monthly CFs were used instead of country and annual CFs. The water
 scarcity footprint calculated at the regional and monthly resolution was
 22Lworld eq/kg FPCM (Fat Protein Corrected Milk) for Waikato milk, and
 1118Lworld eq/kg FPCM for Canterbury milk. The contribution of background
 processes dominated for milk from non-irrigated pasture, but was negligible
 for milk from irrigated pasture, where irrigation dominated the impacts.
 Results were also compared with the previously widely-used Pfister method
 (Pfister et al., 2009) and showed very similar ranking in terms of
 contribution analysis. An endpoint indicator was evaluated and showed damages
 to human health of 7.66x10(-5) DALY/kg FPCM for Waikato and 2.05x10(-3)
 DALY/kg FPCM for Canterbury, but the relevance of this indicator for food
 production needs reviewing. To conclude, this study highlighted the
 importance of using high-resolution CFs rather than aggregated CFs.",
