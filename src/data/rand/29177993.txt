    abstract "Rising admissions from emergency departments (EDs) to hospitals
 are a primary concern for many healthcare systems. The issue of how to
 differentiate urgent admissions from non-urgent or even elective admissions
 is crucial. We aim to develop a model for classifying inpatient admissions
 based on a patient's primary diagnosis as either emergency care or elective
 care and predicting urgency as a numerical value. We use supervised machine
 learning techniques and train the model with physician-expert judgments. Our
 model is accurate (96%) and has a high area under the ROC curve (>.99). We
 provide the first comprehensive classification and urgency categorization for
 inpatient emergency and elective care. This model assigns urgency values to
 every relevant diagnosis in the ICD catalog, and these values are easily
 applicable to existing hospital data. Our findings may provide a basis for
 policy makers to create incentives for hospitals to reduce the number of
 inappropriate ED admissions.",
