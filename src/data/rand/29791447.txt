    abstract "Cottonseed cake biomass, which is a residue of oil extraction,
 is potentially appropriate for use as animal feed, given the high mineral,
 fibre and protein content. The presence of free gossypol, however, a toxic
 pigment in the glands of the cotton plant, limits use of this biomass for
 monogastric livestock. A promising method to detoxify cottonseed cake relies
 on fermentation by fungi, which can eliminate up to 100% of gossypol. In
 order to quantify trace levels of free gossypol in different cotton
 materials, including cottonseed cake treated with macrofungi, a simple and
 rapid chromatographic detection method was developed and validated. Under
 optimized conditions, extraction was performed using 70% acetone. The extract
 was then analysed by Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC),
 with gradient elution on a C18 reverse phase column KINETEX(R) (100 x 2.10
 mm, 2.6 mum). Methanol-0.1% TFA aqueous solution was employed as mobile phase
 and PDA detection conducted at 254 nm. The optimized method was validated by
 analysis of specificity, linearity and range, limit of detection, limit of
 quantification, precision and accuracy. Detection and quantification limits
 were observed at 0.2 and 0.5 mug/mL, respectively. With good reproducibility,
 with precision (RSD)<10% and recovery greater than 94%, the developed assay
 was appropriate for quantification of low quantities of free gossypol. The
 validated method was successfully applied to determine trace levels of free
 gossypol cottonseed treated with a macrofungus.",
