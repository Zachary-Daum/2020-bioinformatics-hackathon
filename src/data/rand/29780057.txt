    abstract "BACKGROUND: Dengue is a clinically important arthropod-borne
 viral disease with increasing global incidence. Here we aimed to estimate the
 prevalence of dengue infections in Khanh Hoa Province, central Viet Nam, and
 to identify risk factors for infection. METHODS: We performed a stratified
 cluster sampling survey including residents of 3-60 years of age in Nha Trang
 City, Ninh Hoa District and Dien Khanh District, Khanh Hoa Province, in
 October 2011. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) against
 dengue were analyzed using a rapid test kit. Participants completed a
 questionnaire exploring clinical dengue incidence, socio-economic status, and
 individual behavior. A household checklist was used to examine environment,
 mosquito larvae presence, and exposure to public health interventions.
 RESULTS: IgG positivity was 20.5% (urban, 16.3%; rural, 23.0%), IgM
 positivity was 6.7% (urban, 6.4%; rural, 6.9%), and incidence of clinically
 compatible dengue during the prior 3 months was 2.8 per 1,000 persons (urban,
 1.7; rural, 3.4). For IgG positivity, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was 2.68
 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-5.81) for mosquito larvae presence in
 water pooled in old tires and was 3.09 (95% CI, 1.75-5.46) for proximity to a
 densely inhabited area. For IgM positivity, the AOR was 3.06 (95% CI,
 1.50-6.23) for proximity to a densely inhabited area. CONCLUSIONS: Our
 results indicated rural penetration of dengue infections. Control measures
 should target densely inhabited areas, and may include clean-up of discarded
 tires and water-collecting waste.",
