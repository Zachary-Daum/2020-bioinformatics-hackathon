    abstract "Aims: The concept of food security and its association with
 chronic diseases are both well-established. During the years within the scope
 of the study, there was a significant increase in the body shape index (ABSI)
 of Indonesian adults. This study tested the hypothesis that the association
 between food security and chronic diseases is mediated, in part, by ABSI.
 Methods: Data was obtained from 2156 Indonesian adults using the Indonesia
 Family Life Survey (IFLS) in 2007 and 2014. Longitudinal study participants
 were interviewed face-to-face for dietary intake data using the food
 frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Food security, a concept developed by the
 World Food Programme (WFP), was calculated based on a food consumption score
 analysis using the FFQ. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) and a
 Sobel-Goodman test were used to test the hypothesis in this study. Results:
 The food consumption score was negatively associated with ABSI. It was also
 negatively associated with systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001). In a formal
 mediation analysis, ABSI significantly mediated the pathway between the food
 consumption score and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The
 effect of food security on hypertension is mediated through body shape.
 Strategies to improve the prevention of hypertension among adults may need to
 take the ABSI and food security, along with nutrition education, into account.",
