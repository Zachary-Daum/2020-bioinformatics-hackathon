    abstract "Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is the most important
 pathogen of Bombyx mori, silkworm and causes severe losses in the silk
 industry. During the virus infectious cycle, budded virus (BVs) and
 occlusion-derived virus (ODVs) particles, which have identical genetic
 content but different phenotypes, are produced. The envelope glycoprotein
 GP64, specific in BVs, is involved in host cell receptor binding and is
 sufficient to mediate membrane fusion during the viral entry. However, the
 host cell factors, interacting with GP64 to mediate BVs infection, are still
 unknown. In this study, a cDNA library of Bombyx mori cells (BmN) was
 constructed and yeast two-hybrid screening was used to identify the host cell
 factors interacting with GP64. One of the eight candidate proteins encoded
 the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SINA-like 10 (SINAL10), was further confirmed
 through coimmunoprecipitation assays as novel GP64 binding protein. Moreover,
 overexpression of SINAL10 significantly enhances viral reproduction, and
 conversely, silencing its expression by small interfering RNAs showed
 significant inhibitory effects. Collectively, we demonstrated that SINAL10 is
 a novel GP64-binding protein that stimulates BmNPV proliferation.",
