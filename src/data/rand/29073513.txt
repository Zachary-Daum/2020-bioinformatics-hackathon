    abstract "Most widely-used stress-induction procedures (such as the TSST
 and the Cold Pressor Test) require considerable effort and overhead in terms
 of preparation, logistics, and staff recruitment. Moreover, while known to
 reliably induce HPA axis activation, especially when combined with social
 self-threat, most conventional laboratory stressors cannot be flexibly
 adapted to elicit either a mainly autonomic or an additional endocrine stress
 response. Being a promising alternative approach, a new version of the
 isometric handgrip test enriched by a social-evaluative component was
 evaluated in the present study. On two consecutive sessions, forty
 participants (20 women) performed a handgrip task at both 45% (stress) and
 10% (control) of maximum voluntary isometric contraction lasting for 3min.
 During the stress test, continuous visual feedback on performance was given.
 Participants in the social-evaluative condition (50%) were observed and
 evaluated by a previously unknown person of the opposite sex, whereas in the
 standard condition feedback was provided via a computer monitor.
 Cardiovascular measures (heart rate, blood pressure) as well as additional
 indices of autonomic reactivity (skin conductance, heart-rate variability)
 were registered before, during, and after stress induction. Moreover, changes
 in salivary cortisol and in subjective well-being were assessed. Relative to
 control, significant increases in cardiovascular and sympathetic activity
 were found, irrespective of experimental group. Importantly, however,
 additional social evaluation resulted in elevated cortisol levels.
 Furthermore, evidence for reduced vagal tone during sustained socially
 evaluated handgrip emerged. In conclusion, the socially evaluated handgrip
 test represents a versatile, time-efficient method to induce stress in small
 laboratory settings.",
