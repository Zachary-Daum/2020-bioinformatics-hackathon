    abstract "At a temperature of 100 K, CH5N2(+).I(-) (I), crystallizes in
 the monoclinic space group P21/c. The formamidinium cation adopts a planar
 symmetrical structure [the r.m.s. deviation is 0.002 A, and the C-N bond
 lengths are 1.301 (7) and 1.309 (8) A]. The iodide anion does not lie within
 the cation plane, but deviates from it by 0.643 (10) A. The cation and anion
 of I form a tight ionic pair by a strong N-Hcdots, three dots, centeredI
 hydrogen bond. In the crystal of I, the tight ionic pairs form
 hydrogen-bonded zigzag-like chains propagating toward [20-1] via strong
 N-Hcdots, three dots, centeredI hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen-bonded chains
 are further packed in stacks along [100]. The thermal behaviour of I was
 studied by different physicochemical methods (thermogravimetry, differential
 scanning calorimetry and powder diffraction). Differential scanning
 calorimetry revealed three narrow endothermic peaks at 346, 387 and 525 K,
 and one broad endothermic peak at  approximately 605 K. The first and second
 peaks are related to solid-solid phase transitions, while the third and
 fourth peaks are attributed to the melting and decomposition of I. The
 enthalpies of the phase transitions at 346 and 387 K are estimated as 2.60
 and 2.75 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The X-ray powder diffraction data
 collected at different temperatures indicate the existence of I as the
 monoclinic (100-346 K), ortho-rhom-bic (346-387 K) and cubic (387-525 K)
 polymorphic modifications.",
