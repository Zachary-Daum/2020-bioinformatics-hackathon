    abstract "Starting at 40 years of age, prespyopia affects a quarter of the
 world population. Many techniques of presbyopia surgery have emerged in
 recent years. The purpose of this study was to compare monovision and
 multifocality and to identify clinical and electrophysiological predictive
 markers of visual comfort for each correction available in clinical practice.
 Ten presbyopic patients participated in this study. Patients received
 monovision and multifocal correction using contact lenses for three weeks
 each in a random order. A clinical evaluation (visual acuity, TNO test,
 binocular contrast sensitivity and quality of vision questionnaires) and an
 electrophysiological evaluation (monocular and binocular pattern VEP with
 multiple spatial frequencies: 60, 30 and 15') were performed before and after
 each correction modality. The P100 was significantly wider and slightly
 earlier after binocular compared to monocular stimulation at T0. The TNO
 stereopsis score decreased significantly after correction. No other
 significant differences, either on clinical or electrophysiological criteria,
 were found between the two modes of correction. Several significant
 correlations were found between the stereoacuity difference depending upon
 correction and evoked potentials by binocular pattern at T0. The larger the
 stereoacuity difference (better stereoacuity with multifocal compensation),
 the longer the latency of the P100 using 60' checks (R=0.82; P=0.004) and the
 greater the amplitude of the N75 using 30' (R=0.652; P=0.04). Our study found
 no differences between the 2 types of correction, but it highlights a benefit
 of VEP used in current practice and measurement of the P100 wave, the best
 indicator of stereopsis and the most consistent, to predict visual comfort
 after compensation presbyopia.",
