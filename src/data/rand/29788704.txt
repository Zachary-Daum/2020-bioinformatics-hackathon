    abstract "BACKGROUND: The number of North Korean refugees entering South
 Korea is rising. Few studies have investigated the risk of non-communicable
 disease in North Korean refugees. Moreover, kidney insufficiency, a risk
 factor for cardiovascular disease, has not been studied in this population.
 We compared the prevalence of non-communicable disease and kidney function in
 North Korean refugees and South Koreans. METHODS: Our study was conducted
 using a case-control design. We enrolled 118 North Korean refugees from the
 Hana Center and selected 472 randomly sampled South Korean individuals as
 controls, who were age- and sex-matched with the North Korean refugees in a
 ratio of 1:4, from the 2014 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination
 Survey database. RESULTS: The prevalence of non-communicable disease did not
 differ significantly between the groups; however, a low estimated glomerular
 filtration rate (eGFR; <90 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) was more prevalent in the
 North Korean refugees than in the South Korean population (52.1% vs. 29.9%,
 P<0.001). After adjusting for covariates and weight gain after escape, the
 prevalence of a low eGFR was associated with the length of residence in South
 Korea (odds ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-7.89). CONCLUSION: The
 prevalence of non-communicable disease did not differ between North Korean
 refugees and the South Korean population, while a low eGFR was more prevalent
 in North Korean refugees than in South Koreans. Moreover, after adjusting for
 other covariates, the prevalence of a low eGFR in North Korean refugees was
 associated with the length of residence in South Korea.",
