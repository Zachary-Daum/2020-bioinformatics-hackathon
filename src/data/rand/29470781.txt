    abstract "Many phytoseiid species, including Phytoseiulus persimilis, are
 known to engage in cannibalism when food is scarce and when there is no
 possibility to disperse. In nature adult females of P. persimilis are known
 to disperse when prey is locally depleted. Males, in contrast, are expected
 to stay and wait for potential mates to mature. During this phase, males can
 obtain food by cannibalizing. Therefore, we hypothesize that male P.
 persimilis exhibit a higher tendency to cannibalize than females. Because
 rearing conditions in the laboratory usually prevent dispersal, prolonged
 culturing may also affect cannibalistic behavior. We hypothesize that this
 should especially affect cannibalism by females, because they consume far
 more food. We tested these hypotheses by comparing males and females from two
 strains, one of which had been in culture for over 20 years, whereas the
 other was recently collected from the field. It is known that this predator
 can discriminate between kin and non-kin and prefers cannibalizing the
 latter, hence to construct lines with high relatedness we created isofemale
 lines of these two original strains. We subsequently tested to what extent
 the adult females and males of the original strains and the isofemale lines
 cannibalized conspecific larvae from the same strain/line in a closed system.
 Relatedness with the victims did not affect cannibalistic behavior, but males
 engaged more often in cannibalism than females, and females of the laboratory
 strain engaged more in cannibalism than those of the field strain, both in
 agreement with our ideas. We hypothesize that the difference in cannibalism
 between the two genders will increase when they have the alternative to
 disperse.",
