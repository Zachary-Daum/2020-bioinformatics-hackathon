    abstract "StatsX (Statistics for X-STR) v2.0 is developed to facilitate
 the workflow for analysis of population data on X-chromosomal short tandem
 repeat (X-STR) marker. The interactive graphical and installable software can
 estimate allele/haplotype frequencies from female, male, and pooled samples
 and calculate forensic parameters by importing a single file. In addition, it
 is able to filter out the invalid raw data and export a series of
 pre-formatted Arlequin input files that are directly used for testing the
 significance of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), linkage disequilibrium
 (LD), and gender differentiation. As expected, all results of frequencies and
 forensic parameters can be saved as EXCEL workbooks and also plotted as bar
 or line graphs. Further, full concordance was obtained by recalculating
 frequencies and forensic parameters with other established software from a
 published Han Chinese population.",
