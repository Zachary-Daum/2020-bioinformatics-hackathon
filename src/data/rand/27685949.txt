    abstract "Keratocytes of the corneal limbal stroma can derive populations
 of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) when expanded in vitro. However, once a
 corneal MSC (cMSC) phenotype is achieved, regaining the keratocyte phenotype
 can be challenging, and there is no standardised differentiation medium.
 Here, we investigated the transition of keratocytes to cMSC and compared
 different supplements in their ability to return cMSC to a keratocyte
 phenotype. Immunofluorescence and quantitative reverse transcription
 polymerase chain reaction demonstrated in vivo keratocyte expression of
 aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1, CD34 and keratocan, but not any of the typical
 MSC markers (CD73, CD90, CD105). As the keratocytes were expanded in vitro,
 the phenotypic profile reversed and the cells expressed MSC markers but not
 keratocyte markers. Differentiating the cMSC back to a keratocyte phenotype
 using nonsupplemented, serum-free medium restored keratocyte markers but did
 not maintain cell viability or support corneal extracellular matrix
 production. Supplementing the differentiation medium with combinations of
 fibroblast growth factor-2, transforming growth factor-beta3 and retinoic
 acid maintained viability, restored expression of CD34, aldehyde
 dehydrogenase 3A1 and keratocan, and facilitated production of abundant
 extracellular matrix as shown by immunofluorescent staining for collagen-I
 and lumican, alongside quantitative assays for collagen and glycosaminoglycan
 production. However, no differentiation medium was able to downregulate the
 expression of MSC markers in the 21-day culture period. This study shows that
 the keratocyte to MSC transition can be partially reversed using serum-free
 media and supplementation with retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor-2 and
 transforming growth factor-beta3 and can enhance this effect. This is
 relevant for development of corneal regenerative strategies that require the
 production of a keratocyte phenotype. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons,
