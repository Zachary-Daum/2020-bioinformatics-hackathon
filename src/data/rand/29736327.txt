    abstract "Games are an increasingly popular approach for conservation
 teaching. However, we know little about the effectiveness of the games on
 students' experiences and knowledge acquisition. Many current games are
 supplemental games (SG) that have no meaningful interaction with the subject
 matter. We adapted the experiential gaming (EG) model where students were
 immersed in goal-orientated tasks found in real-life situations, and they
 tackled questions to complete actions for their main task. Classroom-based
 games were created for eight different conservation topics for an annual
 Wildlife Conservation Course and an annual Diploma in International Wildlife
 Conservation Practice. Data were collected over two cycles, a total sample
 size of 55 multinational students. We used a combination of repeated-measures
 design and counterbalanced measures design; each student was subjected at
 least twice to each of the EG and didactic instruction (DI) treatments, and
 at least once to the SG approach. We compared students' perception, learning
 and behavioural responses to the treatments, including measures of student
 personality types and learning styles as explanatory variables. Findings
 revealed multiple benefits of the classroom EG compared to the DI approach,
 such as increased attention retention, increased engagement and added
 intrinsic motivation. The improved level of intrinsic motivation was mainly
 facilitated by increased social bonding between participants. Further, we
 show that this EG approach appeals to a wide range of learning styles and
 personalities. The performance of SG was generally intermediate between that
 of EG and DI. We propose EG as a beneficial complement to traditional
 classroom teaching and current gamified classes for conservation education.",
