    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Chyle leak following cervical surgery has a
 reported incidence of around 2% annually, and the injury primarily favors a
 left sided involvement. Our patient presented with a right sided neck
 persistent chyle leak status post cervical neck dissection and radiation
 therapy. Infection complicated the patient's clinical course, and he
 inevitably required a right sided VATS thoracic duct ligation. PRESENTATION
 OF CASE: The patient was a 53-year-old African American male, with a past
 medical history of T1N0 right tonsil carcinoma status post chemo-radiation in
 2016. He was found to have a residual right-sided neck mass, and then
 underwent a total neck dissection of the mass and the involved lymph node
 levels. DISCUSSION: Our patient presented with a right sided lymphatic injury
 following a total cervical neck dissection. His presentation was
 uncharacteristic for that the chyle leak was on the right side of his neck,
 and that he subsequently developed cellulitis and bacteremia due to a
 prolonged period to surgical intervention. His refractory response to initial
 conservative measures could have been affected by his prior radiation
 treatment. CONCLUSION: Chyle leakage is a rare complication of total cervical
 neck dissection, and should always be considered even with right sided
 involvement. Conservative management is appropriate in the initial
 presentation; however, if a patient has a prior history of radiation
 treatment to the involved site, thoracic duct ligation implemented early may
 prevent complications such as infection, or a prolonged hospital stay. The
 following case report has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria.",
