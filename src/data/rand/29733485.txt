    abstract "To evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics of prednisone and
 its metabolite prednisolone in pregnant and lactating female subjects, 19
 subjects received prednisone (4-40 mg/day orally) in early (n = 3), mid (n =
 9), and late (n = 13) pregnancy as well as postpartum with (n = 2) and
 without (n = 5) lactation. Serial blood and urine samples were collected over
 1 dosing interval. Prednisone and its metabolite, prednisolone, steady-state
 noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. During pregnancy,
 prednisone apparent oral clearance increased with dose (35.1 +/- 11.4 L/h
 with 5 mg, 52.6 +/- 5.2 L/h with 10 mg, and 64.3 +/- 6.9 L/h with 20 mg, P =
 .001). Similarly, unbound prednisone apparent oral clearance increased with
 dose. In addition, prednisolone renal clearance increased with dose (0.3 +/-
 0.3 L/h with 5 mg, 0.5 +/- 0.4 L/h with 10 mg, and 1.3 +/- 1.1 L/h with 20
 mg, P = .002). Higher prednisone (r = 0.57, P </= .05) and prednisolone (r =
 0.75, P </= .05) concentrations led to a higher percentage of unbound drug.
 Breast-milk/plasma area under the concentration-time curve ratios were
 0.5-0.6 for prednisone and 0.02-0.03 for prednisolone. Relative infant doses
 were 0.35% to 0.53% and 0.09% to 0.18%, for prednisone and prednisolone,
 respectively. Prednisone and prednisolone exhibit dose- and
 concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics during pregnancy, and infant
 exposure to these agents via breast milk is minimal.",
