    abstract "BACKGROUND: The effect of tree age on physicochemical quality
 attributes and storage behaviour of Amrapali mango fruit was evaluated.
 Physiologically mature fruits were harvested from 6-, 18- and 30-year-old
 trees and kept for ripening under ambient conditions (temperature 35 +/- 3 
 degrees C, relative humidity 60 +/- 5%). Observations were recorded at 3-day
 intervals. RESULTS: Highest total soluble solids and total sugars were found
 in the fruit sourced from 18-year-old trees. At the end of storage, least
 titratable acidity (0.17%) and higher carotenoids (10.86 mg 100 g(-1) ) were
 found in 30-year-old tree fruits during the last day of storage. Highest
 total phenols (TP) (251.33 mug gallic acid g(-1) ), antioxidant capacity (AC)
 (5.63 mumol Trolox g(-1) ) and ascorbic acid (AA) (31.13 mg 100 g(-1) ) were
 reported in fruits from younger trees of 6 years old. Maximum respiratory and
 ethylene evolution peak was observed in fruits obtained from oldest trees,
 whereas least activities of pectin methyl esterase (0.31 mumol min(-1) g(-1)
 fresh weight) and polygalacturonase (53.67 mug galacturonic acid g(-1) h(-1)
 ) were observed in 6-year-old tree fruits at the end of the 9-day storage
 period. CONCLUSION: Higher total soluble solids and total sugars were found
 in fruit harvested from middle-age-group (18-year-old) trees during the
 entire storage period of 9 days. Most of the functional parameters, such as
 TP, AC and AA, were observed to be higher in fruits from younger (6-year-old)
 trees. The obtained results revealed that produce from middle-age-group
 (18-year-old) Amrapali mango orchards suit consumers' and processors'
 requirements. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",
