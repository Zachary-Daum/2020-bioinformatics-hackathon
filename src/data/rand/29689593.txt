    abstract "This report provides a brief overview of the basic principles,
 recent advances, and recommendations for the treatment of severe aortic
 stenosis with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in adults.
 Approaches that avoid neurological, cardiac and peripheral vascular
 complications have been developed. In addition, TAVR can be performed in
 intermediate- and low-risk patients. However, these procedures require
 specialized training and may not allow for complete resolution of the
 underlying issue. Even if cardiologists learn to perform the procedure and
 despite advancements in device technology, TAVR is still susceptible to
 structural valve degeneration, thrombosis and late cerebral embolization. To
 date, TAVR has shown no consistent advantage over surgical aortic valve
 replacement (SAVR) in intermediate- and low-risk patients.",
