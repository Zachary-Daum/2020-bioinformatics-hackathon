    abstract "BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the Ross procedure offers
 superior survival compared with mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR).
 OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated experience and compared long-term survival
 between the Ross procedure and mechanical AVR. METHODS: Between 1992 and
 2016, a total of 392 Ross procedures were performed. These were compared with
 1,928 isolated mechanical AVRs performed during the same time period as
 identified using the University of Melbourne and Australia and New Zealand
 Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons' Cardiac Surgery Databases. Only
 patients between 18 and 65 years of age were included. Propensity-score
 matching was performed for risk adjustment. RESULTS: Ross procedure patients
 were younger, and had fewer cardiovascular risk factors. The Ross procedure
 was associated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp
 times. Thirty-day mortality was similar (Ross, 0.3%; mechanical, 0.8%; p =
 0.5). Ross procedure patients experienced superior unadjusted long-term
 survival at 20 years (Ross, 95%; mechanical, 68%; p < 0.001). Multivariable
 analysis showed the Ross procedure to be associated with a reduced risk of
 late mortality (hazard ratio: 0.34; 95% confidence internal: 0.17 to 0.67; p
 < 0.001). Among 275 propensity-score matched pairs, Ross procedure patients
 had superior survival at 20 years (Ross, 94%; mechanical, 84%; p = 0.018).
 CONCLUSIONS: In this Australian, propensity-score matched study, the Ross
 procedure was associated with better long-term survival compared with
 mechanical AVR. In younger patients, with a long life expectancy, the Ross
 procedure should be considered in centers with sufficient expertise.",
