    abstract "AIMS: Continent urinary diversion is preferred by some patients
 and orthotopic urinary diversion (OUD) has become the procedure of choice for
 most men following cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer. OUD in women,
 however, is less common, likely due to a high rate of hypercontinence (HC),
 potentially from lax support of pelvic structures similar to pelvic organ
 prolapse. As such, we evaluated if abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) at the time
 of OUD in women led to decreased rates of HC. METHODS: A retrospective review
 of all female patients receiving OUD by a single surgeon and ASC was
 performed. ASC was performed after RC was complete prior to the
 urethro-enteric anastomosis. Peritoneal flap was created to the vaginal apex.
 The distal leaf was then sutured to the proximal anterior vaginal wall and
 apex and the proximal end sutured to the anterior longitudinal ligament. HC
 was defined as the need to perform intermittent catheterization (IC) due to
 incomplete emptying of the neobladder. RESULTS: Nine women underwent
 cystectomy with OUD and concurrent ASC during the specified time period.
 Average patient age was 54 years (27-69). Mean followup was 61.6 months
 (5-123 months). None of those who underwent ASC had HC or incontinence
 post-operatively. No mesh-related complications were noted in this cohort.
 Pelvic abscess was noted in one patient who underwent ASC with rectus fascia.
 CONCLUSIONS: ASC at the time of radical cystectomy and OUD is safe and
 effective. It appears to be associated with decreased rates of HC and is
 associated with minimal additional morbidity to the patient.",
