    abstract "Background: Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD2) is an
 oxygen sensor that is able to induce hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha
 (HIF-alpha) degradation under normoxic condition. The present paper designed
 to reveal the function of PHD2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells
 proliferation, migration and invasion.Methods: qRT-PCR and Western blot were
 carried out to see the expression of PHD2 in HCC tissues and cell lines. PHD2
 expression in Huh7 and HepG3B cells was overexpressed or suppressed by
 transfection and then the changes of cell proliferation, migration and
 invasion were detected by CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and Western
 blot.Results: PHD2 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines (Huh7,
 Hep3B, SK-HEP-1, HCCLM3 and MHCC97) as relative to para-cancerous non-tumour
 tissues and a normal hepatocyte line MIHA. PHD2 overexpression promoted Huh7
 and Hep3B cells viability, migration and invasion. Meanwhile, CyclinD1,
 c-Myc, MMP-2, MMP-9 and Vimentin were up-regulated, while p53 was
 down-regulated by PHD2 overexpression. PHD2 silence led to a contrary impact.
 Further, PHD2 overexpression up-regulated Ras and Raf expression and induced
 phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, JAK1 and STAT3.Conclusion: PHD2 exhibited
 pro-tumour functions in HCC cells. PHD2 promoted HCC possibly through
 Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/STAT3 pathways.HighlightsPHD2 is highly expressed in
 HCC tissue and cell lines;PHD2 promotes the proliferation of Huh7 and HepG3B
 cells;PHD2 enhances Huh7 and HepG3B cells migration and invasion;PHD2
 activates Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/STAT3 signalling.",
