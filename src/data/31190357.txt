    abstract "Chronic hypoxic heart disease (CHD) is a common clinical type of
 congenital heart disease. Long noncoding RNA regulator of reprogramming
 (lncRNA-ROR) exerts an important regulating effect in cardiovascular
 diseases. In our study, we explored the effect of lncRNA-ROR and the possible
 mechanisms against hypoxia-caused apoptosis in H9c2 cells. H9c2 cells were
 exposed to hypoxia (1% O2 ) to construct the in vitro model of CHD. The level
 of lncRNA-ROR and microRNA (miRNA/miR)-145 was detected. To upregulate the
 level of lncRNA-ROR and miR-145, transfection was carried out. Western blot
 assay was performed to quantified protein expression. The interaction of
 lncRNA-ROR with miR-145 was verified by RIP and Dual-luciferase reporter
 assays. The expression of p53 and Bax was largely elevated and Bcl-2 was
 suppressed by hypoxia induction. We found that lncRNA-ROR was elevated by
 hypoxia. LncRNA-ROR overexpression was able to relieve the damages of H9c2
 cells induced by hypoxia through rescuing viability, suppressing apoptosis,
 and blocking Cytochrome c release. miR-145 was suppressed by overexpressed
 lncRNA-ROR and the combination of miR-145 mimic was able to abolish the
 protective effect of lncRNA-ROR. Moreover, we found that lncRNA-ROR activated
 Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT transduction cascades by suppressing miR-145.
 Besides, lncRNA-ROR directly targeted miR-145 and negatively modulated the
 level of miR-145. Our present study revealed that lncRNA-ROR protected H9c2
 cells against hypoxia-caused damages by regulation of miR-145 through
 activating Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT.",
