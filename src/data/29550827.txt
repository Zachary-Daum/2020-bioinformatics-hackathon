    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chondrocyte apoptosis is largely responsible
 for cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis (OA). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an
 important role in chondrogenesis and cartilage remodeling. This study
 explored the effect of miR-125b on inflammatory injury in chondrogenic cells.
 METHODS: LPS was used to simulate inflammatory injury in murine chondrogenic
 ATDC5 cell lines. Targeting effect of miR-125b on MIP-1alpha 3'UTR was
 assessed by dual luciferase activity assay. Regulatory effect of miR-125b on
 MIP-1alpha expression and the potential regulatory mechanism on inflammatory
 injury were assessed by Western blot. RESULTS: miR-125b expression was
 decreased in LPS-induced ATDC5 cells and overexpression of miR-125b inhibited
 LPS-induced cell viability decline, the rise of apoptosis and inflammatory
 factors' productions. MIP-1alpha expression was negatively related to
 miR-125b, and miR-125b directly targeted with 3'UTR of MIP-1alpha. Knockdown
 of miR-125b promoted LPS-induced inflammatory response via upregulation of
 MIP-1alpha. miR-125b expression in LPS-induced ATDC5 cells was negatively
 related with activations of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling pathways.
 Overexpression of miR-125b inhibited LPS-induced inflammation injury via
 suppressing MIP-1alpha expression and inhibiting activations of NF-kappaB and
 JNK signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: miR-125b could play an important role in
 inflammatory injury of chondrogenic cells and miR-125b affected inflammatory
 injury of ATDC5 cells via regulating expression of MIP-1alpha and regulating
 NF-kappaB and JNK signaling pathways.",
