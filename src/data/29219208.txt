    abstract "Recently, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 has been
 identified as an oncogenic gene in multiple cancer types. However, the
 molecular basis for this observation has not been characterized in lung
 cancer, especially during epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)
 progression. Cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were measured
 using trypan blue exclusion assay, Transwell migration/invasion assay, and
 flow cytometry, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure
 relative expressions of H19, microR-484 (miR-484), and Rho associated
 coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2). Western blot was used to
 measure expressions of apoptosis-, EMT-, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
 pathway-related proteins. Luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the
 target of H19. H19 was highly expressed in both lung cancer tissues and
 cells. Suppression of H19 significantly decreased A549 cell viability,
 migration, and invasion, but promoted apoptosis. Overexpression of H19
 promoted cell migration, invasion, and EMT process. miR-484 was a target of
 H19 and overexpression of it reversed the effects of H19 on EMT. miR-484
 regulated the expression of ROCK2. Mechanistic study revealed that
 suppressing H19 decreased the expression of proteins in JNK pathway, and
 ROCK2 was the main downstream molecule of H19. H19 promoted EMT in lung
 cancer A549 cells by negatively regulating miR-484.",
