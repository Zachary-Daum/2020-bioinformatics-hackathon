    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Astragaloside (AST) is a kind of effective components
 of Astragalus membranaceus, which has been reported to exert extensive
 pharmacological actions in various diseases. However, the effect of AST on
 optic nerve injury remains unclear. The study aimed to uncover the effect of
 AST on oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced RGC-5 cells injury and the
 underlying mechanism. METHODS: Firstly, the model of OGD-induced RGC-5 cells
 injury was constructed. Then, the different doses of AST were used to treat
 RGC-5 cells and the regulatory effects of AST on OGD-induced cell injury were
 analyzed by using CCK-8, flow cytometry and western blot. Subsequently, the
 expression of miR-21 in OGD and AST treated cells was detected by RT-qPCR,
 and miR-21 mimic and inhibitor were transfected into RGC-5 cells to further
 uncover the effect of miR-21 on OGD-induced cell injury. The PTEN-PI3K/AKT
 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways were determined by western blot to
 clear the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: The model of OGD induced RGC-5 cells
 injury was successfully constructed in vitro. AST significantly alleviated
 OGD-induced RGC-5 cells injury by increasing cell viability, inhibiting
 apoptosis and regulating cell cycle-associated factors (p16, p53, and Cyclin
 D1) as well as apoptosis-associated factors (Bax, cleaced-Caspase-3/-9). The
 expression of miR-21 was significantly up-regulated in OGD and AST-treated
 RGC-5 cells. The protective effect of AST on OGD-injured RGC-5 cells was
 further enhanced by miR-21 overexpression. Besides, AST activated
 PTEN-PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways by regulating miR-21 in
 OGD-treated RGC-5 cells. CONCLUSIONS: AST protected RGC-5 cells against
 OGD-induced cells injury by regulating miR-21.",
