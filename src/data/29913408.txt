    abstract "BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid-dependent dermatitis (CDD) is an
 inflammation caused by long-term repeated inappropriate external use of
 corticosteroids. Tripterine is a natural product from the root of
 Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. This study aimed to explore the effect and
 mechanism of tripterine on LPS-induced inflammatory injury in HaCaT cells.
 METHODS: In this study, different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4muM) of
 tripterine and 10muM of LPS were used to treat HaCaT cells. The expression of
 miR-146a was altered by transfection. Cell viability, apoptosis, and the
 release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) were detected by
 CCK-8, flow cytometry analysis, qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. The
 expression levels of apoptosis-related and JNK/ NF-kappaB-related proteins
 were tested by western blotting. RESULTS: We found that 3 and 4muM of
 tripterine significantly decreased cell viability. Tripterine alleviated
 LPS-induced reduction of cell viability, increase of apoptosis and the
 release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in HaCaT cells. miR-146a was down-regulated by
 LPS exposure, while tripterine attenuated this impact. Further, inhibition of
 miR-146a abolished the protective effect of tripterine on cell damage
 triggered by LPS. Finally, tripterine deactivated JNK and NF-kappaB pathways
 through up-regulation of miR-146a. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated
 that tripterine could attenuate LPS-induced inflammatory injury and
 deactivate JNK and NF-kappaB pathways by up-regulation of miR-146a. This
 study will provide a theoretical basis for further study of tripterine in CDD.",
