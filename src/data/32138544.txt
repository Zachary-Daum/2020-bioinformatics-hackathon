    abstract "Renal carcinoma (RCC) is widely accepted as a malignant tumour
 of urinary system. Long intergenic non-coding RNA 1939 (LINC01939) is a novel
 lncRNA which was found to be down-regulated in RCC. Thus, we set out to
 explore the effect and regulation mechanism of LINC01939 in RCC. LINC01939
 and miR-154 in RCC tissues and cell lines were detected using qRT-PCR assay.
 To examine cellular viability of ACHN and CAKI-1 cells, cell counting kit-8
 (CCK-8) assay was exploited here. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted to
 examine apoptosis. Cell mobility was valued through wound healing assays.
 Western blotting was applied for examination of proteins related to
 proliferation, apoptosis, migration and Wnt/beta-catenin/Notch. LINC01939 was
 down-regulated in RCC tissues. LINC01939 overexpression impeded proliferation
 and migration, and induced apoptosis. Further study found that the
 overexpression of LINC01939 strongly suppressed miR-154 expression. Then, the
 inhibiting effect of overexpressed LINC01939 on proliferation and mobility
 and the promoting role of LINC01939 in apoptosis were abolished by the
 combination of miR-154 mimic. Finally, we found that overexpressed LINC01939
 inactivated Wnt/beta-catenin and Notch through suppressing miR-154.
 Up-regulation of LINC01939 inhibited proliferation and migration of RCC cells
 by down-regulating miR-154.",
