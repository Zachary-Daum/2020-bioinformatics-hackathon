    abstract "BACKGROUND: Histone H2AX phosphorylation at the site of Tyr-142
 can participates in multiple biological progressions, which is including DNA
 repair. Ras pathway is closely involved in human cancers. Our study
 investigated the effects of Ras pathway via regulating H2AX.(Y142ph).
 METHODS: Gastric cancer cell line SNU-16 and MKN1 cells were transfected with
 Ras for G12D and T35S site mutation. The phosphorylation of H2A.X(Y142) and
 ERK1/2, WSTF and MDM2 was detected by western blot. Cell viability, cell
 colonies and migration was analyzed by MTT assay, soft-agar colony formation
 assay, and Transwell assay, respectively. The expression of Ras pathway
 related downstream factors, EYA3 and WSTF was detected by qRT-PCR. The
 relationship between Ras and downstream factors were detected by ChIP. The
 cell cycle progression was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS:
 Ras(G12D/T35V) transection decreased the phosphorylation of H2A.X(Y142) and
 activated phosphorylation of ERK-1/2. H2A.X(Y142) inhibited cell viability,
 colonies and migration. H2A.X(Y142ph) altered the expression of Ras
 downstream factors. CHIP assay revealed that Ras(G12D/T35V) could bind to the
 promoters of these Ras pathway downstream factors. Silence of EYA3 increased
 H2A.X(Y142ph) and inhibited cell viability, migration and percent cells in S
 stage. Furthermore, silence of EYA3 also changed the downstream factors
 expression. WSTF and H2A.X(Y142ph) revealed the similar trend and MDM2 on the
 opposite. CONCLUSION: Ras/ERK signal pathway decreased H2A.X(Y142ph) and
 promoted cell growth and metastasis. This Ras regulation process was
 down-regulated by the cascade of MDM2-WSTF-EYA3 to decrease H2A.X(Y142ph) in
 SNU-16 cells.",
