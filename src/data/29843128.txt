    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Zurampic is a US FDA approved drug for
 treatment of gout. However, the influence of Zurampic on pancreatic
 beta-cells remains unclear. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of
 Zurampic on high uric acid-induced damage of pancreatic beta-cells and the
 possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS: INS-1 cells and primary rat islets
 were stimulated with Zurampic and the mRNA expression of urate transporter 1
 (URAT1) was assessed by qRT-PCR. Cells were stimulated with uric acid or uric
 acid plus Zurampic, and cell viability, apoptosis and ROS release were
 measured by MTT and flow cytometry assays. Western blot analysis was
 performed to evaluate the expressions of active Caspase-3 and phosphorylation
 of AMPK and ERK. Finally, cells were stimulated with uric acid or uric acid
 plus Zurampic at low/high level of glucose (2.8/16.7 mM glucose), and the
 insulin release was assessed by ELISA. RESULTS: mRNA expression of URAT1 was
 decreased by Zurampic in a dose-dependent manner. Uric acid decreased cell
 viability, promoted cell apoptosis and induced ROS release. Uric acid-induced
 alterations could be reversed by Zurampic. Activation of Caspase-3 and
 phosphorylation of AMPK and ERK were enhanced by uric acid, and the
 enhancements were reversed by Zurampic. Decreased phosphorylation of AMPK and
 ERK, induced by Zurampic, was further reduced by adding inhibitor of AMPK or
 ERK. Besides, uric acid inhibited high glucose-induced insulin secretion and
 the inhibition was rescued by Zurampic. CONCLUSIONS: Zurampic has a
 protective effect on pancreatic beta-cells against uric acid induced-damage
 by inhibiting URAT1 and inactivating the ROS/AMPK/ERK pathway.",
