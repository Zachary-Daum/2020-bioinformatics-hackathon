    abstract "BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are a kind of troublesome disease
 which caused by long-term pressure and subsequently lead to tissue festering
 necrosis because of sustained ischemia, hypoxia and malnutrition. In our
 study, we used hypoxia to stimulate human umbilical vein endothelial cells
 (HUVECs) to mimic pressure ulcers and investigated the effects of
 Ligustrazine (Lig) with multi-activities on HUVECs. METHODS: HUVECs were
 treated by hypoxia to induce cell injury. HUVECs were administrated with Lig
 and/or transfected with miR-135b inhibitor or negative control. Cell
 viability and cell apoptosis were detected by Cell Counting kit-8 assay and
 flow cytometry, respectively. The protein expression of Cyclin D1 and p53,
 the apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, pro-/Cleaved-Caspas-3), and the
 JNK/SAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways related proteins was examined by western
 blot. RESULTS: Hypoxia-induced injury presented by decreasing cell viability
 and increasing cell apoptosis. Then Lig administration enhanced cell
 viability and inhibited cell apoptosis. Importantly, miR-135b was upregulated
 by the treatment of Lig. Further studies revealed that transfection with
 miR-135b inhibitor led to the opposite result with decreasing cell viability
 and increasing cell apoptosis. In addition, Lig increased the phosphorylation
 of JNK, SAPK, PI3K, AKT and mTOR. CONCLUSION: Lig promoted hypoxia-treated
 HUVECs cell growth as evidenced by increasing cell viability and reducing
 cell apoptosis. This process might be modulated by upregulation of miR-135b
 and subsequent activation of JNK/SAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways.",
