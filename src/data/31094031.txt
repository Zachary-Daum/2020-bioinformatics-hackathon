    abstract "Sinomenine (SIN) is an isoquinoline derived from Caulis
 Sinomenii that has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis
 for several decades in China. This study aims to reveal the effects of SIN on
 mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells growth and inflammation. SIN was used to treat
 ATDC5 cells injured by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The following parameters
 were determined for evaluating the treatment effects of SIN: cell viability,
 apoptosis, reactive oxygen species generation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines
 release. Besides, the expression of LPS-sensitive miRNA (miR-192) and the
 activation of NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling were studied to explain SIN's
 function. SIN with concentration of 30 muM significantly attenuated
 LPS-induced cell damage via increasing cell viability, inhibiting apoptosis
 and reactive oxygen species generation, and declining IL-6 and TNF-alpha
 release. miR-192 was downregulated by SIN treatment. Restoration of miR-192
 expression by miRNA transfection could significantly impede SIN's protective
 action. Besides, the inhibitory effects of SIN on the activation of NF-kappaB
 and MAPK signaling were attenuated by miR-192 overexpression. Furthermore,
 GDF11 was found to be a target gene of miR-192. LPS-mediated injury to
 chondrogenic ATDC5 cells can be relieved by SIN via downregulating miR-192
 and subsequently repressing the activation of NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling.",
