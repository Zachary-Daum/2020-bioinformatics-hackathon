    abstract "BACKGROUND: Myocarditis refers to the inflammatory process that
 affects the muscle tissue of the heart. Persistent myocardial inflammation
 promotes myocardial cell damage, which ultimately leads to heart failure or
 death. Therefore, we aimed to explore the functional impacts of circANKRD36
 on myocarditis. METHODS: H9c2 cells were pre-treated with lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS). Viability and apoptosis were evaluated utilizing CCK-8 assay and flow
 cytometry. Inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression and production were
 assessed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Western blot was utilized to distinguish
 apoptosis and inflammatory related factors expression. Sequentially, the
 above mentioned parameters were reassessed when overexpressed miR-138.
 RESULTS: LPS declined viability and as well as raised apoptosis and
 inflammatory injury in H9c2 cells. Silencing circular RNA ANKRD36
 (si-circANKRD36) alleviated apoptosis and inflammatory injury induced by LPS.
 MiR-138 expression was suppressed by LPS and elevated by si-circANKRD36.
 Increase of viability and inflammatory injury induced by si-circANKRD36 was
 alleviated by down-regulation of miR-138. Eventually, si-circANKRD36
 inhibited p38MAPK/NF-kappaB pathway which activated by LPS via up-regulating
 miR-138. CONCLUSION: Si-circANKRD36 exerted its anti-apoptosis and
 anti-inflammatory function under the condition of LPS in H9c2 cells through
 p38MAPK/NF-kappaB pathway and up-regulation of miR-138.",
