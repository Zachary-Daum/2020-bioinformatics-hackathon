    abstract "BACKGROUND: Dendrobium candidum extract (DCE) has been reported
 to have anti-tumor property. However, the effect of DCE on liver cancer has
 not been well explored. This study was aimed to evaluate the inhibitory
 effect of DCE on liver cancer cells. METHODS: The effect of DCE on liver
 cancer cells was analyzed by detecting cell viability by MTT assay, detecting
 colony formation ability by colony formation assay, determining apoptotic
 cell rate, cell cycle distribution, active caspase-3 positive cells, Ki-67
 positive cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and mitochondrial
 transmembrane potential (MMP) by flow cytometry analysis, and analyzing
 changes of expressions of cell cycle-, apoptosis-, and Wnt/beta-catenin
 pathway-related proteins by Western blot. RESULTS: DCE inhibited viability
 and promoted apoptosis of liver cancer cell lines SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404. DCE
 decreased colony formation, induced cell cycle arrest, and led to cell
 cycle-associated proteins' abnormal expressions in SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404
 cells. DCE effectively suppressed viability and proliferation of primary
 liver cancer cells and also induced aberrant expressions of cell cycle- and
 apoptosis-related proteins. After DCE treatment, ROS level was increased and
 MMP level was decreased. DCE inhibited beta-catenin level in the nucleus and
 regulated downstream genes of beta-catenin and further blocked
 Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404 cells as well as primary
 liver cancer cells. CONCLUSION: DCE suppressed liver cancer SMMC-7721 and
 BEL-7404 cells as well as primary liver cancer cells likely though activating
 mitochondria apoptosis pathway and inducing inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin
 pathway.",
