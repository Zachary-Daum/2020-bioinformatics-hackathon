    abstract "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant
 tumor with high fatality rate. Recent studies reported that up-regulation of
 long non-coding RNA antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (lncRNA ANRIL)
 was found in HCC tissues, and which could affect HCC cells biological
 processes. However, the potential molecular mechanism of ANRIL in HCC is
 still unclear. The study aimed to uncover the effect of ANRIL on HepG2 cells
 growth, migration and invasion. METHODS: The knockdown expression vectors of
 ANRIL were transfected into HepG2 cells, and qRT-PCR, CCK-8, flow cytometry,
 Transwell and western blot assays were performed to analyze the effect of
 ANRIL on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. The relative
 expression of miR-191 was then examined in ANRIL knockdown vector transfected
 cells. These experiments were repeated again for exploring the effect of
 miR-191 on HepG2 cells. NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways
 were examined by using western blot assay. RESULTS: Knockdown of ANRIL
 inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, meanwhile suppressed migration
 and invasion of HepG2 cells. Additionally, the results showed that the
 expression level of miR-191 was down-regulated by ANRIL knockdown in HepG2
 cells. Importantly, overexpression of miR-191 reversed the anti-tumor effect
 of ANRIL on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in HepG2
 cells. Besides, we found that ANRIL knockdown inactivated NF-kappaB and
 Wnt/beta-catenin pathways by regulating miR-191. CONCLUSIONS: These data
 demonstrated that ANRIL knockdown suppressed proliferation, migration,
 invasion, and promoted apoptosis in HepG2 cells by down-regulating miR-191
 and inactivating NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways.",
