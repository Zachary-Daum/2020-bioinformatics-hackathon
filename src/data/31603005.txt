    abstract "Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to varying degrees of sensory
 and motor dysfunction. Salvianolic acid B (Sal-B) is the dominating bioactive
 constituent of Danshen, which has been reported to alleviate liver fibrosis
 and exert neuroprotective effects. But, the influence of Sal-B in SCI remains
 mysterious. The research planned to delve the protective function of Sal-B in
 hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-caused PC-12 cell injury. H2O2-caused PC-12 cells
 injury model was built, CCK-8, Transwell and flow cytometry experiments were
 enforced to assess cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. The microRNA
 (miR)-26a plasmid and the matching control were transfected into PC-12 cells,
 subsequently, the influence of miR-26a inhibition in H2O2-corrupted PC-12
 cells was evaluated. The cell growth-correlated factors and PI3K/AKT and
 MEK/ERK pathways were assayed through western blot assay. Results
 corroborated that Sal-B eased H2O2-evoked injury in PC-12 cells. Ascended
 miR-26a was monitored in Sal-B and H2O2-exposed cells. MiR-26a inhibition
 annulled the protective action of Sal-B in H2O2-corrupted cells. The
 protective function of Sal-B was enabled through activating PI3K/AKT and
 MEK/ERK pathways. These findings delineated that Sal-B protected PC-12 cells
 against H2O2-caused injury through ascending miR-26a via initiating PI3K/AKT
 and MEK/ERK pathways. Highlights H2O2 causes PC-12 cell injury; Sal-B eases
 H2O2-caused PC-12 cell injury; Sal-B protects PC-12 cells against H2O2-caused
 injury via elevating miR-26a; Sal-B activates AKT and MEK/ERK pathways via
 modulating miR-26a.",
