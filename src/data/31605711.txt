    abstract "BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a destructive trauma
 accompanied with local injury. Ginsenoside Rg1 exerts anti-apoptosis and
 anti-autophagy properties. Our goal was to study the protective mechanism of
 Rg1 in attenuating cell injury. METHODS: MiR-216a-5p inhibitor was
 transfected into PC-12cells to verify the growth promoting roles of
 miR-216a-5p, then cells were pre-treated by Rg1 for 24h and treated by 300muM
 hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 1h. Cell viability and apoptosis were tested
 through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry, respectively.
 Expression of miR-216a-5p and cell damage relative factors was tested via
 qRT-PCR and Western blot experiments. RESULTS: H2O2 induced cell activity
 suppression, apoptosis and clear autophagy well at the concentration of
 300muM Rg1 attenuated H2O2-induced cell injury at the concentration of 200muM
 that it elevated cell activity, attenuated apoptosis and autophagy and
 activated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AMP-activated protein kinase
 (AKT) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signal pathways. Further,
 miR-216a-5p was up-regulated by Rg1. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that
 Rg1 attenuated H2O2-caused cell injury through positively regulated
 miR-216a-5p.",
