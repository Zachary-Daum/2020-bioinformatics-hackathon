    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: High expression in hepatocellular carcinoma
 (HEIH) is an long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) which is highly expressed in
 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Aberrant expression of HEIH is implicated in
 regulating HCC cells growth and metastasis. This study attempted to
 illustrate the effects of HEIH on HCC cell lines. METHODS: The expression
 changes of HEIH in HCC tumor tissues and the paracancerous tissues derived
 from 20 patients with HCC were tested. Effects of HEIH on Huh7 and Hep3B
 cells viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed by
 silencing HEIH in vitro. Furthermore, downstream effector and signaling of
 HEIH were studied. RESULTS: As compared with the paracancerous tissues, the
 HEIH expression was highly expressed in tumor tissues. Silence of HEIH
 significantly reduced Huh7 and Hep3B cells viability, migration, and
 invasion, but induced apoptosis. It was coupled with the downregulated
 CyclinD1, Bcl-2, MMP-2, MMP-8, Vimentin, the upregulated p53, Bax, as well as
 the cleaved caspase-3. MicroRNA (miR)-199a-3p was identified as a downstream
 effector of HEIH, as its expression was upregulated by HEIH silence, and the
 functional effects of HEIH on Huh7 and Hep3B cells were all attenuated when
 miR-199a-3p expression was suppressed. Furthermore, HEIH silence suppressed
 the activation of mTOR signaling via upregulating miR-199a-3p. CONCLUSION:
 HEIH silence might be a promising target for suppressing HCC cells growth and
 metastasis. Silence of HEIH exerted its antitumor properties possibly through
 upregulating miR-199a-3p, and thereby blockage of mTOR signaling.",
