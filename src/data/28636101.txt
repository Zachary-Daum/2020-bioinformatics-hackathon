    abstract "Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common bone malignancies
 and occurs almost exclusively in children and adolescents. This study aimed
 to explore the role of lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in OS cells
 growth and metastasis, and to uncover the possible underlying mechanism. In
 this study, the expressions of MEG3 in five OS cell lines (MG63, OS-732,
 SaOS, G292, and 143B) and in a human osteoblast cell line hFOB1.19 were
 measured by qRT-PCR analysis. The expressions of MEG3, miR-127, and ZEB1 in
 OS-732 cells were overexpressed or suppressed by transfection. Cell
 viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were then assessed. The results
 showed that MEG3 was highly expressed in OS cell lines when compared to
 hFOB1.19 cell. MEG3 silence significantly suppressed OS-732 cells growth and
 metastasis, as evidenced by the decreases in cell viability, migration,
 invasion, and increase in apoptotic cell rate. MEG3 acted as an endogenous
 sponge by binding to miR-127. More interestingly, MEG3 silence could not
 suppress OS-732 cells growth and metastasis when miR-127 was knocked down.
 ZEB1 was a target gene of miR-127, and miR-127 overexpression-induced
 impairments in cell growth and metastasis were attenuated when ZEB1 was
 overexpressed. Moreover,miR-127 suppression activated JNK and Wnt signaling
 pathways, while these activations were recovered by ZEB1 silence. To
 conclude, our findings suggest that lncRNA MEG3 promoted OS cells growth and
 metastasis in vitro through sponging miR-127. This study provides the
 evidence that MEG3 may be a potential therapeutic target for OS.",
