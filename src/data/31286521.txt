    abstract "Colon cancer is a detrimental neoplasm of the digestive tract.
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as central regulators have been discovered in colon
 cancer. Nonetheless, the impact of miR-204-3p on colon cancer remains
 indistinct. The research attempted to uncover the impacts of miR-204-3p on
 colon cancer cells growth, migration, and invasion. miR-204-3p expression
 level in colon cancer tissues and diverse colon cancer cell lines were
 testified by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
 Exploration of the impacts of miR-204-3p on cell growth, migration, invasion,
 and their associated factors through assessment of CCK-8, flow cytometry,
 Transwell, and western blot, respectively. High mobility group AT-hook 2
 (HMGA2) expression was then detected in Caco-2 cells after miR-204-3p mimic
 and inhibitor transfection, additionally dual-luciferase activity was
 implemented to further uncover the correlation between HMGA2 and miR-204-3p.
 The impact of HMGA2 on Caco-2 cell growth, migration, and invasion was
 finally assessed. We found that repression of miR-204-3p was discovered in
 colon cancer tissues and HCT116, SW480, Caco-2, HT29 and SW620 cell lines.
 MiR-204-3p overexpression mitigated Coca-2 cell viability, facilitated
 apoptosis, simultaneously adjusted CyclinD1 and cleaved caspase-3 expression.
 Cell migration, invasion, and the associated factors were all suppressed by
 miR-204-3p overexpression. Reduction of HMGA2 was presented in Caco-2 cells
 with miR-204-3p mimic transfection, and HMGA2 was predicated to be a target
 gene of miR-204-3p. Besides, HMGA2 silence showed the inhibitory effect on
 Caco-2 cells growth, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, miR-204-3p
 repressed colon cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion through targeting
 HMGA2.",
