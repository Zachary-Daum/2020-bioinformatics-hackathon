    abstract "Finding novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of cerebral
 ischemia is urgently required. These experiments explored the potential roles
 of 6-Gingerols (6G) in hypoxia-stimulated rat PC-12 cells. Cell viability,
 apoptosis and its related proteins were studied by the approaches of MTT
 assay, flow cytometry assay and Western blot analysis, respectively. In
 addition, whether 6G achieved its functions in hypoxia-induced injury through
 miR-103 was illustrated. Moreover, the associated signalling pathways were
 investigated. Obviously, hypoxia treatment blocked cell viability and
 enhanced apoptosis while this trend was ameliorated by 6G. Then we observed
 that hypoxia administration up-regulated miR-103 expression and 6G could
 further increase miR-103 expression in hypoxia-stimulated PC-12 cells.
 Inhibition of miR-103 attenuated the neuroprotective effects of 6G on
 hypoxia-treated PC-12 cells. Moreover, Bcl2/adenovirus EIB 19kD-interacting
 protein 3 (BNIP3) was a target of miR-103 and BNIP3 upregulation also
 attenuated the neuroprotective impact of 6G on hypoxia-treated PC-12 cells.
 Hypoxia activated the p38MAPK and JNK pathways were inactivated by 6G. To sum
 up, 6G protected hypoxia-stimulated PC-12 cells through miR-103-mediatated
 down-regulation of BNIP3 by inhibiting p38 MAPK and JNK pathways. Highlights
 6-Gingerols (6G) is a promising agent for cerebral ischemia therapy. The
 neuroprotective effects of 6G are mediated by miR-103 and BNIP3.
 Up-regulation of miR-103 exerts neuroprotective effects.",
