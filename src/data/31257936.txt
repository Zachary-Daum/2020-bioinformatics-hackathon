    abstract "Shikonin has been testified to wield the anti-tumor action in
 multiple cancers. But, the clout of Shikonin for gastric cancer (GC) is still
 inconclusive. The contemplation of this research undertook to disclose the
 impacts of Shikonin on GC progress meanwhile to uncover the conceivable
 mechanism. NCI-N87 cells were disposed by Shikonin at diverse concentration
 points. The trials of CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry and Transwell
 assays were executed for detecting the functions of Shikonin in NCI-N87
 cells. The impacts of miR-195 on Shikonin-regulated PI3K/AKT pathway were
 estimated via western blot. The in vivo trial was detected by xenografts
 model assay. We found that Shikonin suppressed cell survival and triggered
 apoptosis in NCI-N87 cells. Additionally, Shikonin restrained cell migration,
 invasion and down-regulated MMP2, RhoA, ROCK1 and Vimentin expression in
 NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, Shikonin notably inhibited PI3K/AKT signal
 pathway, but the restraining functions were repealed by miR-195 inhibition in
 NCI-N87 cells. The in vivo trial results revealed that Shikonin determinately
 impeded tumor formation. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that
 Shikonin prohibited NCI-N87 cells proliferation, migration, invasion, and
 accelerated apoptosis by inactivation of PI3K/AKT pathway. The findings maybe
 provide a fresh opinion for healing GC.",
