    abstract "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered as one of the most common
 neural degenerative diseases in human. Although the continuous investigations
 about AD have been made in recent decades, the pathogenesis of this disease
 is still not definitely confirmed. MicroRNA-125b (miR-125b) is extensive
 expressed in many types of human tissues and played pivotal regulatory roles
 in diverse biological process. In the present study, we aimed to explore the
 roles of miR-125b in regulating neurons cell apoptosis under AD condition.
 The possible molecular mechanisms were also investigated. We found that
 miR-125b was up-regulated in patients with AD. Transfection with miR-125b
 significantly enhanced the apoptosis of neurons cells and phosphorylation of
 Tau by activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and p35/25. Forkhead
 box Q1 (FOXQ1) was the direct target gene of miR-125b, which involved in the
 effects of miR-125b on neurons cell apoptosis and phosphorylation of Tau. Our
 research interpreted the mechanism of up-regulation of miR-125b in
 pathological Tau phosphorylation and AD occurrence. miR-125b may be a novel
 regulator of AD progress and could be as a therapeutic target for AD therapy.",
