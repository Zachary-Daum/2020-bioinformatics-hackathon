    abstract "This study aimed to explore the biological functions of long
 noncoding RNA activated by transforming growth factor-beta (lncRNA-ATB) in
 bladder cancer cells. For the expressions of lncRNA-ATB, miR-126, and KRAS,
 T24 cells were transfected with their specific vectors/shRNA or
 mimic/inhibitor. Then cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis as
 well as the protein levels of apoptosis-related factors and PI3K/AKT and mTOR
 signal pathways were measured. The relationships of lncRNA-ATB and miR-126 or
 miR-126 and KRAS were analyzed by Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay. Functional
 experiments showed that lncRNA-ATB overexpression significantly promoted cell
 viability, migration, and invasion in T24 cells. lncRNA-ATB was a molecular
 sponge of miR-126 and exerted tumor-promoting effects by downregulation of
 miR-126. Moreover, KRAS was a direct target of miR-126 and was negatively
 regulated by miR-126. Finally, overexpression of KRAS increased cell
 viability, migration, and invasion, as well as activated PI3K/AKT and mTOR
 signaling pathways in T24 cells. The results revealed that lncRNA-ATB was an
 oncogene, which promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by
 regulating miR-126 in bladder cancer. These findings may provide a potential
 prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for bladder cancer.",
