    abstract "This study aimed to investigate the effect and potential
 modulation mechanism of lnc-SLC4A1-1 on breast cancer (BC) carcinogenesis.
 The expression of lnc-SLC4A1-1 in tissue and serum samples from BC patients,
 as well as BC cell lines, was detected by real-time quantitative reverse
 transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs). Next, the expression of
 lnc-SLC4A1-1 was silenced or upregulated in BC cells, then cell
 proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected using MTT,
 flow cytometry analysis and Transwell assay. Meanwhile, the expression of
 apoptosis-related proteins and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related
 proteins were detected by western blotting. Furthermore, potential mechanism
 of lnc-SLC4A1-1 was explored by chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA
 immunoprecipitation assays. CXCL8 was overexpressed to evaluate the
 relationship between lnc-SLC4A1-1 and CXCL8. Lnc-SLC4A1-1 was significantly
 up-regulated in BC tissue, serum samples and cell lines. In BC cells,
 lnc-SLC4A1-1 knockdown promoted cell apoptosis and suppressed cell
 proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, lnc-SLC4A1-1 is
 transcriptionally activated by H3K27 acetylation, and lnc-SLC4A1-1 interacted
 with transcription factor (NF)-kappaB p65, thereby regulating CXCL8
 expression. Meanwhile, CXCL8 overexpression partly reversed the effects of
 lnc-SLC4A1-1 knockdown on cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion
 in BC cells. Lnc-SLC4A1-1 could promote the development of BC by regulating
 NF-kappaB/CXCL8. Highlights Lnc-SLC4A1-1 was overexpressed in BC tissues,
 blood and cell lines. Lnc-SLC4A1-1 was transcriptionally activated by H3K27
 acetylation. Lnc-SLC4A1-1 interacted with NF-kappaB to promote CXCL8
 expression. Lnc-SLC4A1-1 could promote the development of BC.",
