    abstract "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a typical disease of
 female endocrine and metabolic abnormalities. miR-155, famous as a
 multifunctional miRNA, promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of
 human cancer cells. Therefore, we aimed to explore its regulation mechanism
 in PCOS. BrdU incorporation and apoptosis assay were used to test KGN cell
 survival. Luciferase activity experiment was employed to test targeting link
 between miR-155 and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). Migration and invasion
 assay were operated to examine the influence of miR-155 and PDCD4 in
 migration and invasion of KGN cells. In addition, quantitative reverse
 transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay and western blot
 analysis were utilized to measure expression of miR-155 and other relative
 factors. We found that expression of miR-155 was high in PCOS patients'
 tissues and it promoted proliferation, migration and invasion in KGN cells.
 Further studies found that PDCD4 was down-regulated by miR-155 and was a
 target of miR-155. Overexpression of PDCD4 promoted cell apoptosis to
 mitigate PCOS. Besides, up-regulation of PDCD4 suppressed PI3K/AKT and JNK
 signal pathways. To sum up, miR-155 promoted proliferation, migration,
 invasion and the activation of PI3K/AKT and JNK pathways in KGN cells through
 negatively regulating PDCD4.",
