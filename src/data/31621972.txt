    abstract "The present study was aimed to explore the functional role of
 microRNA (miR)-29b in colon cancer, as well as underlying mechanisms.
 Expressions of miR-29b and folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) were measured in both
 human colon tumor samples and cell lines. Colon cancer cell lines SW480 and
 SW620 were transfected with miR-29b mimic, antisense oligonucleotides
 (ASO)-miR-29b, small interfering (siRNA) against FOLR1 (si-FOLR1), or
 corresponding negative controls (NCs), and then were incubated with or
 without oxaliplatin (L-OHP). Thereafter, cell viability, cytotoxicity, cell
 apoptosis, and expression of FOLR1, ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily G Member 2
 (ABCG2) and p-glycoprotein (p-gp) were analyzed. We found that miR-29b was
 significantly decreased, while FOLR1 was statistically elevated in colon
 cancer samples and cell lines compared to the nontumor samples and
 nontumourigenic immortalized human colon epithelial cell line FHC.
 Overexpression of miR-29b markedly inhibited cell viability, promoted
 sensitivity to L-OHP, stimulated cell apoptosis (all p < .05), and decreased
 the levels of ABCG2 and p-gp in cancer cells, whereas suppression of miR-29b
 showed contrary results. Moreover, we observed that FOLR1 was a direct target
 of miR-29b and was negatively regulated by miR-29b. In addition, the findings
 revealed that the effects of FOLR1 inhibition on cell viability, sensitivity
 to L-OHP, cell apoptosis, and the levels of ABCG2 and p-gp were similar to
 overexpression of miR-29b. Taken together, our study suggests that miR-29b
 inhibits cell growth and promotes sensitivity to L-OHP in colon cancer by
 targeting FOLR1.",
