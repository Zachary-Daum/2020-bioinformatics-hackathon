    abstract "Belinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor drug capable of
 regulating cell growth in diverse cancers. Nonetheless, little information
 clarified the role of Belinostat in breast cancer. Hence, the functions of
 Belinostat in breast cancer cells survival was disclosed in this study.
 Belinostat at 50 and 100 muM were applied to manage MCF-7 cells, cell
 viability, Ki67 positive cells, cell cycle and apoptosis were monitored via
 MTT, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the
 apoptosis-related factors, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and PKC pathway were
 tested through western blot and qRT-PCR. Lastly, in vivo effect of Belinostat
 was determined by a murine model. The results showed that Belinostat dampened
 cell viability, decreased the proportion of Ki67 positive cells and arrested
 cells at G0/G1 phase. The decreases of Wnt/beta-catenin, CCND2 and Myc were
 observed in MCF-7 cells after Belinostat stimulation. Additionally,
 Belinostat induced cell apoptosis, meanwhile dampened Bcl-2 and raised Bax
 and Cleaved caspase 3 in a dose and time-dependent manner. Additionally,
 Belinostat activated PKC pathway by upgrading PKCdelta and P53 expressions.
 Furthermore, Belinostat restrained tumour weight and volume in vivo. In
 summary, this study depicted that Belinostat prohibited proliferation and
 evoked apoptosis via mediating Wnt/beta-catenin and PKC pathways in MCF-7
 cells.",
