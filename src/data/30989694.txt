    abstract "Vinculin is a highly conserved protein involved in cell
 proliferation, migration, and adhesion. However, the effects of vinculin on
 gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the
 functional role of vinculin in GC, as well as its underlying mechanism.
 Expression of vinculin in patients with GC was analyzed by real-time
 polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry.
 Overall survival was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank
 test. The relationship between vinculin and clinicopathological
 characteristics of patients with GC was further identified. In addition, we
 assessed the expression of vinculin in GC cell lines. Besides, vinculin was
 suppressed or overexpressed by transfection with small interfering
 (si-vinculin) or pcDNA-vinculin and then cell viability, cell apoptosis,
 and/or migration was respectively examined by the 3-(4,
 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2, 5-biphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, flow
 cytometer, and scratch assay, respectively. Moreover, the cell cycle- and
 apoptosis-related proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. The
 expression of vinculin was significantly increased in the GC tissues and
 cells compared with the nontumor tissues or cells. Vinculin protein positive
 staining was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. Moreover,
 vinculin was significantly associated with Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) and
 poor differentiation. Patients with high vinculin levels had significantly
 worse overall survival than those with low levels. Suppression of vinculin
 significantly decreased cell viability and migration and promoted cell
 apoptosis. However, overexpression of vinculin statistically increased cell
 viability but had no effects on cell apoptosis. Vinculin promotes GC
 proliferation and migration and predicts poor prognosis in patients with GC.",
