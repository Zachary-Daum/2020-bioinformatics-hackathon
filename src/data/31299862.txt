    abstract "Background: Despite the medical uses of lidocaine has been
 well-characterized, the study of lidocaine's pharmacological function other
 the anaesthetic effect was never stopped. This study designed to reveal the
 effect of lidocaine on the growth and metastasis of lung cancer in vitro.
 Methods: A549 and NCI-H1299 cells were treated by lidocaine for 24 h. miR-539
 expression in cell was silenced by transfection with the specific inhibitor.
 The changes in cell growth and metastasis were determined using CCK-8 assay
 and western blot. Luciferase activity assay was performed to assay if EGFR
 was a target of miR-539. Western blot was used to test the activation of EGFR
 downstream signalling. Results: Lidocaine suppressed the viability,
 migration, and invasion of A549 and NCI-H1299 cells while induced apoptotic
 death. Lidocaine elevated the expression of miR-539. The anti-tumour
 properties of lidocaine towards A549 and NCI-H1299 cells were partially
 attenuated when miR-539 was silenced. EGFR was a target of miR-539. Lidocaine
 repressed the activation of ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways also via regulating
 miR-539. Conclusion: The anti-growth and anti-metastatic effects of lidocaine
 towards lung cancer cells. The anti-tumour properties of lidocaine may be
 partial via up-regulation of miR-539, which blocked EGFR signalling by
 directly binding with EGFR.",
