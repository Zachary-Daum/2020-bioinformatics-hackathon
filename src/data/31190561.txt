    abstract "Background: The anti-inflammatory function of microRNA-124
 (miR-124) has been a matter of extensive studies in the last few years.
 Although LINC00305 regulates biological activities by acting as a miR sponge,
 it is still unexplored whether LINC00305 is involved in inflammation by
 regulating miR-124. Methods: Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated with
 commercial kits, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Annexin V-fluorescein
 isothiocyanate (FITC) kit, respectively. LINC00305, miR-124 and mRNA levels
 were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Protein
 level was assessed with Western blot assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
 assay (ELISA). Results: The expression of LINC00305 was up-regulated by
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LINC00305 overexpression further suppressed the
 cell viability, promoted apoptosis and induced inflammation in LPS-treated
 ATDC5 cells while its silence enhanced the cell viability, inhibited
 apoptosis and ameliorated inflammation. miR-124 was negatively regulated by
 LINC00305 and its overexpression abolished the effects of LINC00305 in the
 presence of LPS. LINC00305 further triggered the Notch/nuclear factor kappa B
 (NF-kappaB) signalling pathway in LPS-treated ATDC5 cells and this activation
 was abrogated when ATDC5 cells overexpressed miR-124. Conclusion: LINC00305
 might emerge as a novel suppressor for miR-124. LINC00305-caused miR-124
 silence compromises ATDC5 cell viability and ultimately results in
 inflammatory insults by activating Notch/NF-kappaB pathway.",
