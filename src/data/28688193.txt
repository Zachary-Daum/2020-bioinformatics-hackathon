    abstract "Osteosarcoma is a rare malignant bone tumor with high degree of
 malignancy. HULC (highly upregulated in liver cancer), a long noncoding RNA
 (lncRNA) was involved in hepatocellular carcinoma development and
 progression, but its underlying mechanism in osteosarcoma is unknown. The aim
 of this study was to explore the functional role of HULC in osteosarcoma. The
 study was conducted in human osteosarcoma cell lines and the expression of
 HULC in the cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the effects of
 HULC on tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells were evaluated by in vitro
 assays. Results revealed that HULC was highly expressed in osteosarcoma MG63
 and OS-732 cells compared to osteoblast hFOB1.19 cells. Suppression of HULC
 in osteosarcoma cells inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion, and
 promoted apoptosis. HULC functioned as an endogenous sponge for miR-122, and
 its silence functioned through upregulating miR-122. HNF4G was a target of
 miR-122, and the effect of HNF4G on OS-732 cells was the same as HULC.
 Furthermore, overexpression of miR-122 inactivated PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and
 Notch pathways by downregulation of HNF4G. These findings suggest that
 knockdown of HULC inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion by
 sponging miR-122 in osteosarcoma cells. HULC may act as a novel therapeutic
 target for management of osteosarcoma.",
