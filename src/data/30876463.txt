    abstract "BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer receives considerable attention not
 only because it is the most common cancer all through the world, but also
 because it's on the top third leading reason for cancer-related death.
 Lidocaine is a well-documented local anesthetic that has been reported to
 suppress cancer development. The study explored the effects of lidocaine on
 the growth, migration and invasion of the gastric carcinoma cell line MKN45
 and the mechanism behind. METHODS: The effect of lidocaine on viability,
 proliferation and apoptosis of MKN45 cells were analyzed by Cell Counting
 Kit-8 assay, BrdU staining assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Moreover,
 cell migration and invasion were both examined by Transwell assay. The
 expression of apoptosis-, migration-, and invasion-related proteins were
 detected by western blot. The relative expression of miR-145 was determined
 by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the impact which lidocaine brought on MEK/ERK and
 NF-kappaB pathways were examined by western blot. RESULTS: Lidocaine
 inhibited viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of MKN45 cells,
 while enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, miR-145 expression was enhanced by
 lidocaine; and transfection with miR-145 inhibitor increased cell viability,
 proliferation, migration, and invasion, but inhibited apoptosis. The
 up-regulation of miR-145 was partly contributed to the inhibitory effect of
 lidocaine on gastric cancer cell line MKN45. Finally, lidocaine inactivated
 MEK/ERK and NF-kappaB pathways via up-regulation of miR-145. CONCLUSIONS: Our
 results suggested that lidocaine decreased growth, migration and invasion of
 MKN45 cells via regulating miR-145 expression and further inactivation of
 MEK/ERK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways.",
