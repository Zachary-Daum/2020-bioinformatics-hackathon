    abstract "BACKGROUND: Poor understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of
 astragaloside IV (AS-IV) in cardiovascular protection limits clinical
 application of AS-IV in heart failure. Hypoxia is an important stimulus in
 the progression of heart failure. We investigated the role of AS-IV in
 hypoxia-treated cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. METHODS: Cell viability and
 apoptotic cells in hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells were detected by CCK-8 assay
 and flow cytometry, respectively. Expression of proteins associated with
 proliferation and apoptosis was measured by Western blot. Then effects of
 AS-IV on hypoxia-induced cell injury were explored, and the alteration of
 lncRNA growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5) level under AS-IV treatment was
 determined by RT-qPCR. Whether AS-IV affected hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells via
 lncRNA GAS5 was subsequently testified. Besides, whether AS-IV regulated
 lncRNA GAS5 expression was via modulating the PI3K/mTOR pathway was
 investigated. RESULTS: Hypoxia-induced decreasing cell viability, increasing
 apoptotic cells, and proteins associated with proliferation and apoptosis
 were all attenuated by AS-IV treatments. Then, we found that lncRNA GAS5
 expression was down-regulated by AS-IV treatment, and AS-IV might affect
 hypoxia-stimulated H9c2 cells through lncRNA GAS5. Finally, we found that
 inhibition of PI3K/mTOR or mTOR could reverse the AS-IV-induced
 down-regulation of lncRNA GAS5 in H9c2 cells. CONCLUSION: AS-IV protected
 H9c2 cells against hypoxia through down-regulating lncRNA GAS5. Besides,
 AS-IV might repress lncRNA GAS5 expression via activation of the PI3K/mTOR
 pathway.",
