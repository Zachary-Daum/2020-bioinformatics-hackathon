    abstract "Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has been widely reported to play
 an important role in inflammatory response. In this study, we aimed to
 explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of APS on lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS)-induced inflammation injury in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. H9c2 cells were
 treated with different concentrations of APS, and cell viability was detected
 by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Then, the effect of APS on cell
 viability and apoptosis induced by LPS was determined by CCK-8, flow
 cytometry, and western blot. The expression and release of inflammatory
 cytokines were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
 (qRT-PCR), western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
 Furthermore, expression of miR-127 in H9c2 cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR, and
 knocked down by transfection with miR-127 inhibitor. Western blot was used to
 analyze signaling pathway molecules. APS had no effect on H9c2 cells
 viability. However, APS could alleviate LPS-induced inflammation injury by
 increasing cell viability, reducing apoptosis, and inhibiting release of
 inflammatory cytokines in H9c2 cells ( P < 0.05). Additionally, we found that
 APS increased toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expressions in LPS-treated H9c2
 cells. Mechanistically, we found that APS exerted the protective effect by
 down-regulating LPS-increased expression of miR-127 ( P < 0.05), inhibiting
 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), JNK and promoting phosphoinositide
 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathways in LPS-treated H9c2
 cells. The results demonstrated that APS could protect H9c2 cells against
 LPS-induced inflammation injury, which might be partially due to miR-127
 down-regulation and regulation of NF-kappaB, JNK, and PI3K/AKT signaling
 pathways. These findings indicated that APS might be a potential therapeutic
 drug for treatment of myocarditis.",
