    abstract "BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication
 of diabetes mellitus, which is a major reason of blindness. Baicalin (BAI) is
 a flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis, whose pharmacological
 characterizes have been widely reported in various diseases. However, it
 remains unclear the effect of BAI on DR. The study aimed to confirm the
 protective effect of BAI on DR. METHODS: ARPE-19 cells and HRMECs were
 exposed to the high glucose (HG) environment to construct a cell injury
 model. After treatment with HG and BAI, cell viability, apoptosis,
 inflammatory cytokines and ROS generations were determined in ARPE-19 cells
 and HRMECs. Subsequently, microRNA-145 (miR-145) inhibitor and its negative
 control were transfected into ARPE-19 cells, and the regulatory effects on
 HG-and BAI-co-treated cells were detected. NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signaling
 pathways were finally examined to state the underling mechanisms. RESULTS: HG
 treatment significantly induced ARPE-19 cells and HRMECs injury in vitro. BAI
 significantly promoted cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, as well as
 inhibited the release of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and ROS level in HG-injured
 ARPE-19 cells and HRMECs. Additionally, the expression level of miR-145 was
 up-regulated in HG-and BAI-co-treated cells. More importantly, miR-145
 inhibition reversed the protective effect of BAI on HG-injured ARPE-19 cells.
 Besides, we observed that BAI inhibited the activations of NF-kappaB and
 p38MAPK pathways by up-regulating miR-145. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated
 that BAI exhibited the protective effect against HG-induced cell injury by
 up-regulation of miR-145.",
