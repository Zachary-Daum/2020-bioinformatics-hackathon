    abstract "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most major
 type of primary hepatic cancer. This study aimed to explore the possible
 oncogenic effects of the long noncoding RNA cardiac hypertrophy-related
 factor (CHRF) on HCC, as well as the underlying possible mechanism. METHODS:
 The expression levels of CHRF and microRNA-211 (miR-211) in HCC tissues
 and/or cell lines HepG2 and Huh-7 were measured using quantitative reverse
 transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cell transfection was conducted to
 change the expression levels of CHRF and miR-211 in cells. Cell viability and
 apoptosis were assessed using the cell counting kit-8 assay and annexin
 V-phycoerythrin staining, respectively. The pull-down assay and RNA
 immunoprecipitation were performed to analyze the association between CHRF
 and miR-211. The expression of the key factors involving in cell
 proliferation, cell apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
 process, as well as the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B
 (AKT) and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways, were evaluated by Western blot analysis.
 RESULTS: CHRF was highly expressed in HCC tissues and positively associated
 with the TNM stage, differentiation, and size of tumors. Overexpression of
 CHRF promoted HepG2 cell viability, proliferation, and EMT process. CHRF
 knockdown had opposite effects. Moreover, CHRF negatively regulated the
 expression of miR-21, and miR-21 was a direct target of CHRF. Overexpression
 of miR-211 reversed the effects of CHRF on HepG2 and Huh-7 cell viability,
 proliferation, and EMT process. Furthermore, overexpression of CHRF activated
 the PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways in HepG2 cells by downregulating
 miR-211. CONCLUSION: CHRF played oncogenic roles in HCC. The overexpression
 of CHRF promoted HepG2 and Huh-7 cell viability, proliferation, and EMT
 process by downregulating miR-211 and then activating the PI3K/AKT and
 Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.",
