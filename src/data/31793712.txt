    abstract "CircRNA derived from vacuolar ATPase assembly factor (circVMA21)
 is a newly-researched circRNA, which is reported to adjust the degeneration
 of intervertebral disc. But, function of circVMA21 in infantile pneumonia is
 yet to be explored. The research surveyed the role of circVMA21 in
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-caused WI-38 cell inflammatory injury. LPS (10
 mug/ml, 12 hr) was exploited to arouse WI-38 cell inflammatory injury.
 Subsequently, the mediatory impacts of microRNA (miR)-142-3p and circVMA21 in
 LPS-evoked cell injury were detected after transfection with the inhibited or
 overexpressed vectors. In above processes, cell behaviors of cell viability,
 apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory factors were monitored. NF-kappaB and JNK
 pathways were elucidated to showcase the feasible molecular mechanisms.
 Results displayed that LPS engendered WI-38 cell inflammatory injury was
 alleviated as well as activated NF-kappaB and JNK pathways was interdicted by
 miR-142-3p suppression. Importantly, restrained miR-142-3p expression was
 discovered in WI-38 cells after overexpressing circVMA21. Moreover,
 overexpressed circVMA21 exerted the similar functions as miR-142-3p
 suppression in LPS-triggered WI-38 cell injury. But, the influence was
 clearly reversed by miR-142-3p overexpression. Hindered NF-kappaB and JNK
 pathways caused by overexpressed circVMA21 was also crippled by miR-142-3p
 overexpression. The research discolsed that circVMA21 protected WI-38 cells
 to resist LPS-triggered inflammatory injury via miR-142-3p-NF-kappaB/JNK axis.",
