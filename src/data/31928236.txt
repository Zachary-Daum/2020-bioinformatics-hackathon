    abstract "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of decreased
 vision and blindness globally. The aim of this study was to understand the
 role of physcion 8-O-beta-glucopyranoside (PG) in high glucose (HG)-induced
 DR and to investigate whether lncRNA NORAD/miR-125/STAT3 signalling was the
 underlying mechanism involved in DR. To this end, the serum levels of NORAD,
 miR-125, and STAT3 were determined in patients with DR. The APRE-19 cells
 were subjected to HG treatment to construct the cell model of DR. HG-disposed
 APRE-19 cell injury was assessed by detecting cell viability, apoptosis,
 concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha and
 IL-1beta, and ROS generation. Moreover, the effect of PG on HG-disposed
 APRE-19 cell injury was investigated. NORAD was then overexpressed to
 investigate the combined effects of NORAD overexpression and PG on
 HG-disposed APRE-19 cell injury. Furthermore, the regulatory relationship
 between NORAD and miR-125 as well as miR-125 and STAT3 was investigated. The
 expression levels of NORAD and STAT3 were significantly increased in the
 serum of DR patients, while the miR-125 expression was decreased. The HG
 treatment-induced injury to APRE-19 cells, which were alleviated by PG
 treatment. Moreover, PG alleviated HG-disposed injury to ARPE-19 cells by
 decreasing NORAD. NORAD negatively regulated miR-125 expression and the
 combined effects of NORAD and PG on HG-disposed ARPE-19 cell injury were
 reversed by miR-125 overexpression. Furthermore, STAT3 was confirmed as a
 target gene of miR-125. Our results show that PG exerts protective roles in
 HG-disposed DR via regulating lncRNA NORAD/miR-125/STAT3 signalling.
 NORAD/miR-125/STAT3 axis may provide a novel perspective for target therapy
 of DR.",
