    abstract "Magnesium (Mg(2+) ) has been shown to exert neuroprotective
 effects against hypoxia. However, it still remains elusive whether Mg(2+)
 protected mouse hippocampal HT22 cells against hypoxia-evoked damages.
 Therefore, we aimed to investigate the function of Mg(2+) and mechanisms
 associated with microRNA-221 (miR-221). HT22 cells were exposed to 3% O2 for
 24 hours to induce hypoxic damages with 21% as a normoxic culture condition.
 The damages were monitored by viability, migration, and apoptosis of HT22
 cells with or without Mg(2+) pretreatment. Quantitative reverse
 transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to examine the
 alteration of miR-221, miR-210, and miR-17-5p. Transduction was carried out
 to artificially alter the expression of miR-221 and nerve growth factor
 (NGF), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR or Western blot assays. To blunt
 phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and nuclear factor
 kappaB (NF-kappaB), LY294002 (10 microM) and BAY 11-7082 (10 microM) were
 used. We observed Mg(2+) protected HT22 cells against hypoxia-induced damages
 by upregulating miR-221. Further, miR-221 positively regulated NGF
 expression. Overexpression of NGF alleviated cell injury, while suppression
 of NGF aggravated cell injury. Moreover, miR-221 elevated NGF by inducing
 phosphorylation of regulators in PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB transduction cascades
 and then alleviated cell injury. In conclusion, Mg(2+) protected HT22 cells
 against hypoxia-induced damages by upregulation of miR-221 and NGF. These
 findings provided insights into the development of improved strategies for
 clinical application.",
