    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause
 of morbidity and mortality. Here, we sought to explore the potential role and
 underlying mechanism of miR-145 in MI. METHODS: H9c2 cells were cultured
 under persistent hypoxia to simulate MI. The hypoxia-induced injury was
 assessed on the basis of cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis.
 The expression of miR-145 was evaluated by qRT-PCR and the influence of
 aberrantly expressed miR-145 on H9c2 cells under hypoxia was also estimated.
 Utilizing bioinformatics methods, the target genes of miR-145 were verified
 by luciferase reporter assay. Then, effects of abnormally expressed target
 gene on miR-145 silenced H9c2 cells were assessed. Finally, the
 phosphorylation levels of key kinases in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
 (PI3K)/AKT and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular
 signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways were detected by Western blot
 analysis. RESULTS: Hypoxia remarkably lowered viability, migration and
 invasion but promoted cell apoptosis. Meantime, the miR-145 level was
 up-regulated in H9c2 cells under hypoxia. Following experiments suggested
 that hypoxia-induced injury was exacerbated by miR-145 overexpression while
 was alleviated by miR-145 silence. Rac1 was predicted and further validated
 to be a target gene of miR-145. The influence of miR-145 silencing on H9c2
 cells under hypoxia could be reversed by down-regulation of Rac1.
 Additionally, the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, MAPK and ERK were all
 elevated in miR-145 silenced cells and these alterations were reversed by
 down-regulation of Rac1. CONCLUSION: miR-145 silencing could protect H9c2
 cells against hypoxia-induced injury by targeting Rac1, in which PI3K/AKT and
 MAPK/ERK pathways might be involved.",
