    abstract "Background: Despite the characters of the resistance of tumour
 of ailanthone (AIL) were found in various tumour cells, its effect on
 osteosarcoma is still unclear. Herein, we attempted to see the effects of AIL
 on an osteosarcoma cell line MG63. Methods: MG63 cells were treated by AIL,
 following which CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay, Transwell assay and Western blot
 were utilized to detect cell proliferation, migration, invasion and
 apoptosis. miR-126 expression in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines was
 measured by qRT-PCR. Further, the target of miR-126 and the downstream
 signalling for AIL were studied. Results: Treating MG63 cells with 1.5 muM
 AIL for 24 h significantly suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion and
 induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, AIL inhibited PI3K/AKT pathway and up-regulated
 miR-126 expression. miR-126 of osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines was low
 expressed, as relative to paracancerous tissues and normal osteoblast. The
 anti-tumour effects of AIL were attenuated by miR-126 silencing. Further,
 VEGF-A was a target of miR-126. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that AIL
 was effective in inhibiting MG63 cells growth, migration and invasion. The
 anti-tumour properties may be via up-regulating miR-126 and thereby
 degradation of VEGF-A.",
