    abstract "BACKGROUND: Fracture healing is a very important process after
 fracture. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) has been reported to possess beneficial
 impact on osteoblasts growth. Our study investigated the effects of Tan IIA
 on fracture healing. METHODS: In vitro, mouse pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells
 were treated with Tan IIA. Then, the protein levels of Runx2, Osx, Collagen
 I, JNK and c-Jun, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition
 were detected, respectively. Furthermore, the roles of microRNA-424 (miR-424)
 and Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in Tan IIA-caused MC3T3-E1 cell
 differentiation were probed. In vivo, mice open osteotomy at femur diaphysis
 model was established. The callus area, callus intensity, low-density bone
 volume/callus total volume (BV1/TV), tissue mineral density (TMD) and bone
 mineral density (BMD) were tested. RESULTS: In vitro, Tan IIA promoted
 MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation via increasing the Runx2, Osx and collagen I
 expression, along with enhancing ALP activity and calcium deposition. In
 addition, Tan IIA activated JNK pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells, while inhibition
 of JNK pathway mitigated the Tan IIA-caused MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation.
 Moreover, Tan IIA declined the miR-424 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells.
 Overexpression of miR-424 also weakened the Tan IIA-caused MC3T3-E1 cell
 differentiation. BMP-2 was a target gene of miR-424. BMP-2 silence reversed
 the Tan IIA-caused activation of JNK pathway. In vivo, Tan IIA increased the
 callus area, callus intensity, BV1/TV, TMD and BMD. CONCLUSION: Tan IIA could
 promote fracture healing. In vitro, Tan IIA promoted MC3T3-E1 cell
 differentiation might be via down-regulating miR-424, up-regulating BMP-2 and
 then activating JNK pathway.",
