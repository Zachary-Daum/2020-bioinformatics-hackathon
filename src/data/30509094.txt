    abstract "This study investigates the influence of long noncoding RNA
 HOST2 on the biological functions of gastric cancer cells; including
 proliferation, migration and invasion. Differentially expressed lncRNAs in
 gastric cancer (GC) were screened by microarray analysis, and HOST2
 expression in GC tissues and cell lines was determined by quantitative
 real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were
 detected by CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays. Western blot
 investigated expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related
 proteins, and association was established between over-expressed HOST2 and
 the number of patients with lymph node and distant metastasis. HOST2
 expression was also positively related to GC cell invasion ability, and
 although its expression in the p-shHOST2 group was remarkably decreased, it
 was significantly higher than in the Mock and NC groups. Compared to the Mock
 and NC groups, the p-shHOST2 group presented significant decreases in
 proliferation and wound healing rates, and the reverse result was noted in
 the p-HOST2 group. In addition, the number of p-shHOST2 group invasive cells
 was remarkably less than in the Mock and NC group, and the opposite result
 was achieved in the p-HOST2 group. Moreover, p-HOST2 had more significant
 EMT, but this was suppressed in the p-shHOST2 group. Finally, HOST2 silencing
 suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion; and it could
 therefore be considered as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in
 gastric cancer.",
