    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: HULC is a multifunctional lncRNA that has
 pro-angiogenic function in various cancers. The present study was designed to
 see the role of lncRNA HULC in normal endothelial cells angiogenesis.
 METHODS: Cell viability, apoptosis, migration, tube formation and expression
 levels of angiogenesis-related proteins were respectively assessed in human
 microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells after lncRNA HULC was silenced by
 shRNA transfection. Cross-regulation between lncRNA HULC and miR-124, and
 between miR-124 and MCL-1 were detected by qRT-PCR, sequence analysis, and
 luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Silence of lncRNA HULC significantly
 reduced viability, migration, tube formation and protein levels of VEGF,
 VEGFR2, CD144 and eNOS in HMEC-1 cells. Meanwhile, silence of lncRNA HULC
 induced apoptosis in HMEC-1 cells, as Bcl-2 was down-regulated, Bax was
 up-regulated, and caspase-3 and -9 were cleaved. miR-124 expression was
 negatively regulated by lncRNA HULC, and HULC worked as a molecular sponge
 for miR-124, in having miR-124 exhausted. Besides, MCL-1 was a target gene of
 miR-124. Rescue assay results showed that the effects of lncRNA HULC silence
 on HMEC-1 cells growth, migration and angiogenesis were abolished by miR-124
 suppression. Similarly, the effects of miR-124 on HMEC-1 cells were abolished
 by MCL-1 overexpression. Furthermore, MCL-1 activated PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT
 signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a pro-angiogenic role
 of lncRNA HULC in endothelial cells. The pro-angiogenic actions of lncRNA
 HULC may be through sponging miR-124, preventing MCL-1 from degradation by
 miR-124.",
