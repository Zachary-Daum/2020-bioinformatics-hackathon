    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common inflammatory
 joint disease. miRNAs are associated with OA and functionally implicated in
 the pathogenesis of the disease. In the present study, we investigated the
 role of miR-1246 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury
 of ATDC5 cells. METHODS: ATDC5 cells were cultured and treated with LPS in a
 series of concentration (0, 1, 5, and 10 microg/ml) for 5 h. The cells were
 transfected with miR-1246-mimic, inhibitor, si-HNF4gamma or negative control,
 then were assessed for cell viability using CCK8 assay, apoptosis by
 flow-cytometry and expressions of miR-1246 and pro-inflammatory cytokines by
 qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Cell viability was significantly
 reduced and cell apoptosis was added in ATDC5 cells injured with LPS at the
 dosage of 5 and 10 microg/ml. Relative mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory
 cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha) were significantly increased.
 miR-1246 was up-regulated in ATDC5 cells treated with LPS. Moreover, miR-1246
 overexpression aggravated LPS-induced decrease in cell viability, increase in
 apoptosis and overproduction of pro-inflammatory factors. mRNA and protein
 expressions of HNF4gamma were significantly suppressed in cells transfected
 with miR-124-mimic. Further, miR-1246 knockdown alleviated LPS-induced
 inflammatory injury by up-regulating the expression of HNF4gamma and
 activation of PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of
 miR-1246 alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury in chondrogenic ADTC5
 cells by up-regulation of HNF4gamma and activation of PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT
 pathways. The findings of this study will provide a novel viewpoint regarding
 miR-1246 target for clinical.",
