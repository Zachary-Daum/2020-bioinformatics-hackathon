    abstract "Background: The interaction of long non-coding RNAs
 (lncRNAs)-microRNAs (miRs) exerts crucial functions in mediating inflammatory
 reaction. It is still unclear whether myocardial infarction associated
 transcript 2 (Mirt2)-miR-377 mediates the inflammatory pathogenesis in
 Sjogren's syndrome (SS). Methods: The inflammatory lesion model was
 established by stimulating salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) by
 interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Mirt2- and/or miR-377-transfected SGECs, as
 well as their negative controls, were applied to investigate the biological
 functions in inflammation. Cell viability and apoptosis were examined using
 commercial kits. Western blot was applied to quantify protein level, and
 enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) was used to value the secretion of
 cytokines. Results: The up-regulation of Mirt2 was observed in
 IFN-gamma-treated SGECs. Mirt2 overexpression restored the expression of
 miR-377 which was repressed by IFN-gamma. However, miR-377 silence abolished
 the protective effect on cell viability, inhibitory effect on apoptosis and
 prohibitive role in pro-inflammatory factors. Mirt2 diminished the
 phosphorylated expression of crucial regulators while miR-377 silence
 restored the phosphorylation in IFN-gamma-treated SGECs. Conclusion: Mirt2
 was elevated in IFN-gamma-treated SGECs and then up-regulated miR-377 in
 response to inflammatory lesions. Mechanically, in synergy with miR-377 Mirt2
 blocked IFN-gamma-evoked activation of NF-kappaB and JAK/STAT signalling
 pathway.",
