    abstract "The research aims to explore the roles and regulatory mechanisms
 of the circular RNA (circRNA) ZNF292 (circZNF292) in OGD-induced damage in
 H9c2 cells. The H9c2 cells were treated by OGD and/or transfected with
 circZNF292, si-circZNF292, pc-Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B-19 kDa-interacting protein
 3 (BNIP3) or corresponding controls. Cell viability was detected with the
 CCK-8. The protein expression levels of the Bax, caspase-3, Beclin-1, p62,
 LC3, BNIP3, Wnt3a, beta-catenin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were
 individually determined via western blot. qRT-PCR was used to examine the
 circZNF292 expression level. The apoptotic rate was determined by the Annexin
 V-FITC/PI with flow cytometer. The production of the circZNF292 was promoted
 by OGD. Abundant circZNF292 released OGD-induced damage by up-regulating cell
 viability and Wnt3a/beta-catenin or mTOR proteins, but down-regulating
 apoptosis and autophagy. circZNF292 had an opposite effect on these elements
 mentioned above. Besides, BNIP3 was negatively adjusted by the circZNF292.
 The BNIP3 overproduction destroyed the protective effect of circZNF292 on
 H9c2. circZNF292 released OGD-induced damage in the H9c2 cells by targeting
 the BNIP3 through Wnt/beta-catenin and mTOR activation.",
