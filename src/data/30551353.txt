    abstract "BACKGROUND: Glioma is a common brain tumor, which is a serious
 threat to the life and health of human with high mortality rate. Recently,
 neferine (NEF) has been reported to play an important role in various
 cancers. In the study, we aimed to investigate the effect of NEF on human
 glioma cell line U251. METHODS: U251 cells were pre-treated with different
 concentrations of NEF, and then CCK-8, BrdU, flow cytometry and transwell
 assays were used to test cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and
 invasion. Subsequently, the expression vectors of miR-10b mimic and miR-10b
 inhibitor were transfected into U251 cells, and the relative expression of
 miR-10b was examined by qRT-PCR. The main proteins of CyclinD1/p53/p16,
 pro-Caspase-3/-9, cleaved-Caspase-3/-9, MMP-9, Vimentin, PTEN/PI3K/AKT and
 p38MAPK signal pathways were determined by western blot assay. RESULTS: NEF
 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis, as well
 as regulated CyclinD1, p53, p16 and cleaved-Caspase-3/-9 expressions in U251
 cells. Moreover, NEF inhibited cell migration, invasion and decreased MMP-9
 and Vimentin expression in U251 cells. Additionally, miR-10b expression was
 down-regulated in NEF-stimulated cells, and overexpression of miR-10b
 reversed the regulatory effects of NEF on U251 cells proliferation,
 migration, invasion and apoptosis. Additionally, we found that PTEN was a
 direct target of miR-10b in U251 cells. Besides, NEF deactivated
 PTEN/PI3K/AKT and p38MAPK signal pathways by down-regulation of miR-10b in
 U251 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that NEF exerted anti-tumor
 effect by down-regulation of miR-10b and deactivation of PTEN/PI3K/AKT and
 p38MAPK signal pathways in glioma cells. These findings might provide a novel
 therapeutic strategy for glioma.",
