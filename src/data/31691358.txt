    abstract "Osteoporosis is one of the most common and debilitating skeletal
 disorders. Although studies in the last decade had uncovered the signaling
 pathways involved in bone formation stimulation, preventative of the onset
 and more efficient therapeutic strategies for the treatment of osteoporosis
 remain an important unmet clinical need. MicroRNAs were reported to play an
 important role in maintaining bone development and metabolism. We
 investigated the effect of miR-23a-3p on the proliferation and
 differentiation of osteoblast isolated from the tibia bone tissue of
 osteoporosis rats. Eighty Wistar female rats were divided into osteoporosis
 model group and normal group. Tibia bone tissues and osteoblasts were
 isolated for the following experiments. Quantitative reverse
 transcription-polymerase chain reaction illustrated that miR-23a-3p
 expression was significantly increased, while PGC-1alpha/WNT/beta-catenin
 signaling related proteins were significantly inhibited in tibia bone tissues
 of osteoporosis rat compared with normal control rat. MiR-23a-3p inhibited
 PGC-1alpha expression and suppressed the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway
 via directly targeting PGC-1alpha. Furthermore, suppression of miR-23a-3p
 increased cell viability and cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis in
 primary osteoblast, and promoted alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium
 nodules by targeting PGC-1alpha/WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our study
 revealed that inhibition of miR-23a-3p promoted the osteoblasts proliferation
 and differentiation through targeting PGC-1alpha/WNT/beta-catenin signaling
 in osteoporosis rats.",
