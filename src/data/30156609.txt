    abstract "Long non-coding RNA antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus
 (ANRIL) has been reported to promote tumorigenesis via regulating microRNA
 (miR)-99a in gastric cancer cells. However, the role of each component
 involved in it is still not well understood. This study aimed to verify the
 role of ANRIL in gastric cancer as well as the underlying mechanisms. ANRIL
 levels in clinical gastric cancer tissues and cell lines were tested by qPCR.
 Effects of ANRIL silence on cell viability, migration and invasion,
 apoptosis, and miR-99a expression in MKN-45 and SGC-7901 cells were measured
 using CCK-8, Transwell assay, flow cytometry, and qPCR assays, respectively.
 Then, effects of miR-99a inhibition on ANRIL-silenced cells were evaluated.
 B-lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 (BMI1) expression, after abnormal
 expression of ANRIL and miR-99a, was determined. Finally, expression of key
 proteins in the apoptotic, Notch, and mTOR pathways was assessed. ANRIL level
 was elevated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of ANRIL
 suppressed cell viability, migration, and invasion, and increased apoptosis
 through up-regulating miR-99a. Furthermore, ANRIL silence down-regulated BMI1
 via up-regulating miR-99a. BMI1 silence down-regulated Bcl-2 and key kinases
 in the Notch and mTOR pathways and up-regulated p16 and cleaved caspases. We
 verified the tumor suppressive effects of ANRIL knockdown in gastric cancer
 cells via crosstalk with miR-99a. Together, we provided a novel regulatory
 mechanism for ANRIL in gastric cancer, in which ANRIL silence down-regulated
 BMI1 via miR-99a, along with activation of the apoptotic pathway and
 inhibition of the Notch and mTOR pathways.",
