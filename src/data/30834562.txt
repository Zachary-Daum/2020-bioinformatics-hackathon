    abstract "This study intended to investigate the potential molecular
 mechanism of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in
 the development of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI). The
 expression of TUG1 in the serum from patients with sepsis resulted in AKI,
 and healthy controls were analyzed. First, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS;
 to induce AKI rat mesangial cells (RMCs) for establishing the septic AKI
 model in RMCs. Subsequently, TUG1 was overexpressed in RMCs and the
 influences of overexpression of TUG1 on cell biological processes (viability,
 apoptosis, and autophagy) and cytokines secretion in LPS-associated RMCs were
 investigated. Furthermore, the interaction between TUG1 and miR-142-3p was
 investigated, and the target of miR-142-3p was predicted. Also, whether TUG1
 could regulate the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signal was
 investigated. The results showed that TUG1 was lowly expressed in the serum
 patients with sepsis-associated AKI compared with that in the controls. In
 addition, overexpression of TUG1 relieved the injury induced by LPS in RMCs.
 Moreover, miR-142-3p was negatively regulated by TUG1, and TUG1 upregulation
 restrained LPS-associated injury by suppression of miR-142-3p. Sirtuin 1
 (SIRT1) was identified as a target of miR-142-3p, which could be negatively
 regulated by miR-142-3p. Furthermore, overexpression of TUG1 suppressed the
 activation of NF-kappaB signal in RMCs, which was markedly reversed after
 miR-142-3p upregulation. Our findings reveal that downregulation of lncRNA
 TUG1 may promote the development and progression of sepsis-associated AKI via
 regulating miR-142-3p/SIRT1 axis and modulating NF-kappaB signal.",
