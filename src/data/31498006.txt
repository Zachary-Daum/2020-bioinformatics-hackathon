    abstract "This research planned to grab the expression and impact of
 lncRNA HAGLROS in the biology and progression of mantle cell lymphoma.
 HAGLROS level in mantle cell lymphoma cell lines was detected, followed by
 investigation of the influences of HAGLROS silencing on Mino cell biological
 performances. Afterwards, the express patterns of HAGLROS vs. miR-100, as
 well as miR-100 vs. ATG5, were investigated. Furthermore, whether HAGLROS
 could regulate the signals of PI3K/AKT/mTOR was analyzed. HAGLROS level was
 high in mantle cell lymphoma cell lines. Silencing of HAGLROS inhibited Mino
 cell viability, increased apoptosis and decreased autophagy by sponging
 miR-100. Moreover, miR-100 targeted ATG5 fixed. Furthermore, HAGLROS
 suppression resulted in inhibition on the briskness of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signals.
 Concurrently HAGLROS suppression and miR-100 inhibitor markedly changed the
 impacts of HAGLROS down-regulation alone on activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signals,
 which could further change after co-transfection of si-HAGLROS + miR-100
 inhibitor + siATG5. Our findings point out that expression of HAGLROS is
 increased in mantle cell lymphoma cells and may function as an oncogene in
 mantle cell lymphoma. HAGLROS may promote tumour development by regulating
 miR-100/ATG5/PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis.",
