    abstract "BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a serious complication of
 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Long non-coding RNA taurine upregulated
 gene 1 (lncRNA TUG1) exerted critical regulatory effects on inhibiting cell
 injury and inflammation. However, its role in LN is still unclear. METHODS:
 HK-2 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate cell
 inflammatory injury. Cell viability and apoptosis, as well as
 pro-inflammatory factors expression were measured, respectively. Then, HK-2
 cells were transfected with pEX-TUG1 or sh-TUG1 to explore the effects of
 TUG1 on LPS-induced cell injury. Potential binding effects between TUG1 and
 microRNA-223 (miR-223), as well as between miR-223 and Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) were
 verified. miR-223 mimic or miR-223 inhibitor was transfected to assess the
 effects of miR-223 on cell injury. Finally, the roles of Sirt1 in LPS-induced
 HK-2 cell injury and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein
 kinase 3 (PI3K/AKT) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways were
 explored. RESULTS: LPS administration inhibited HK-2 cell viability and
 proliferation, increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors, and promoted
 cell apoptosis. TUG1 overexpression protected HK-2 cells against LPS-induced
 injury via negatively regulating miR-223 expression. TUG1 suppression had
 opposite effects. Sirt1 was a direct target gene of miR-223 in HK-2 cells,
 which participated in the effects of miR-223 on HK-2 cells and was related
 with the activation of PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways. CONCLUSION: TUG1
 protected HK-2 cells against LPS-induced inflammatory injury by regulating
 miR-223 and Sirt1 expression, and then activating PI3K/AKT and inactivating
 NF-kappaB pathways. TUG1 might be a potential therapeutic target for LN
 treatment.",
