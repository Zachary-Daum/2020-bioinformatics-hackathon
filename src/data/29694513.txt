    abstract "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be associated with
 heart valve disease, which can be caused by inflammation. This study aimed to
 investigate the functional impacts of miR-27a on TNF-alpha-induced
 inflammatory injury in human mitral valve interstitial cells (hMVICs). hMVICs
 were subjected to 40 ng/mL TNF-alpha for 48 h, before which the expressions
 of miR-27a and NELL-1 in hMVICs were altered by stable transfection. Trypan
 blue staining, BrdU incorporation assay, flow cytometry detection, ELISA, and
 western blot assay were performed to detect cell proliferation, apoptosis,
 and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. We found that miR-27a was lowly
 expressed in response to TNF-alpha exposure in hMVICs. Overexpression of
 miR-27a rescued hMVICs from TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory injury, as cell
 viability and BrdU incorporation were increased, apoptotic cell rate was
 decreased, Bcl-2 was up-regulated, Bax and cleaved caspase-3/9 were
 down-regulated, and the release of IL-1beta, IL-6, and MMP-9 were reduced.
 NELL-1 was positively regulated by miR-27a, and NELL-1 up-regulation
 exhibited protective functions during TNF-alpha-induced cell damage.
 Furthermore, miR-27a blocked JNK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways, and
 the blockage was abolished when NELL-1 was silenced. This study demonstrated
 that miR-27a overexpression protected hMVICs from TNF-alpha-induced cell
 damage, which might be via up-regulation of NELL-1 and thus modulation of JNK
 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways.",
