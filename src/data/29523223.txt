    abstract "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in
 children and adolescents. This study aimed to explore the effects of long
 noncoding RNA CAT104 and microRNA-381 (miR-381) on osteosarcoma cell
 proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, as well as the underlying
 potential mechanism. We found that CAT104 was highly expressed in
 osteosarcoma MG63 and OS-732 cells. Knockdown of CAT104 significantly
 inhibited OS-732 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, but promoted
 cell apoptosis. CAT104 regulated the expression of miR-381, and miR-381
 participated in the effects of CAT104 on OS-732 cells. Zinc finger
 E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was a direct target gene of miR-381, which
 was involved in the regulatory roles of miR-381 in OS-732 cell proliferation,
 migration, invasion, and apoptosis, as well as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
 and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. In conclusion, our research verified that
 suppression of CAT104 exerted significant inhibitory effects on osteosarcoma
 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating the expression of
 miR-381 and downstream ZEB1, as well as JNK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.",
