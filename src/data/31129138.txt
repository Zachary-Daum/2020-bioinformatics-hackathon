    abstract "AIMS: Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2
 (ERK1/2) is a key downstream gene of Ras pathway. Activation of Ras-ERK1/2
 has been testified to be linked to the progression of diverse cancers.
 Nonetheless, whether Ras-ERK1/2-tumorigenic pathway is mediated by epigenetic
 factors remains indistinct. The purpose of the research attempted to disclose
 the functions of H2BK5ac in Ras-ERK1/2-evoked CRC cell phenotypes. MATERIALS
 AND METHODS: Western blot assay was implemented for exploration of the
 relevancy between Ras-ERK1/2 and H2BK5ac. H2BK5Q was established and its
 functions in cell viability, colony formation and migration were appraised
 via utilizing MTT, soft-agar colony formation and Transwell assays. The mRNA
 and transcription of ERK1/2 downstream genes were estimated via RT-qPCR and
 ChIP assays. HDAC2 functions in SW48 cell phenotypes were evaluated after
 co-transfection with pEGFP-Ras(Q61L/T35S) and si-HDAC2 vectors. Additionally,
 the involvements of ATF2 and MDM2 in Ras-ERK1/2-affected H2BK5ac expression
 were estimated. KEY FINDINGS: H2BK5ac expression was evidently repressed by
 Ras-ERK1/2 pathway in SW48 cells. Moreover, Ras-ERK1/2-elevated cell
 viability, the number of colonies and migration were both impeded by H2BK5ac.
 The mRNA and transcriptions of CYR61, IGFBP3, WNT16B, NT5E, GDF15 and CARD16
 were both mediated by H2BK5ac. Additionally, HDAC2 silence overtly recovered
 H2BK5ac expression inhibited by Ras-ERK1/2, meanwhile abated
 Ras-ERK1/2-affected SW48 cell phenotypes. Beyond that, restrained H2BK5ac
 induced by Ras-ERK1/2 was concerned with MDM2-mediated ATF2 degradation.
 SIGNIFICANCE: These investigations testified that Ras-ERK1/2 pathway affected
 SW48 cell phenotypes through repressing H2BK5ac expression. Otherwise,
 declined H2BK5ac might be linked to MDM2-mediated ATF2 degradation.",
