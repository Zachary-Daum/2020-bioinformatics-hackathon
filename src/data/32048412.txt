    abstract "Liver cancer is a malignant tumor that occurs in the liver and
 has a high mortality rate. We strived to detect the role and mechanism of
 circRNA-0072309 in liver cancer. Hep3B cell line was transfected with pc-circ
 and si-circ for viability, colony formation, apoptosis, migration, and
 invasion tests, which were individually performed by CCK-8, colony formation
 detection, flow cytometry assay, migration and invasion assays. What is more,
 the luciferase reporter assay was conducted to determine the target
 relationship between the circRNA-0072309 and microRNA (miR)-665. The
 expression of circRNA-0072309 was examined by qRT-PCR. The expression of
 proteins was examined via western blot. CircRNA-0072309 was lowly expressed
 in liver cancer tissues and positively associated with 5-year survival rate.
 The viability, colony formation, invasive and migratory ability were
 inhibited by abundant circRNA-0072309, which promoted cell apoptosis on the
 contrary. CircRNA-0072309 knockdown induced opposite effects, but could not
 affect apoptosis. Overexpressed miR-665 in tumor tissues was targeted and
 negatively controlled by circRNA-0072309. The PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin
 pathways were inhibited by abundant circRNA-0072309. miR-665 overexpression
 disturbed those effects derived from pc-circ. The circRNA-0072309 had
 antitumor influences in Hep3B cell line through targeting miR-665 relying on
 the deactivation of PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.",
