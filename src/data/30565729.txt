    abstract "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a common leading cause of
 cancer-related death worldwide. Ailanthone, a natural compound isolated from
 Chinese herb Ailanthus altissima, has been reported to exert
 antiproliferative effects on various cancer cells. METHODS: The present study
 aimed to investigate the role of ailanthone in the lung cancer cells and the
 correlation between the ailanthone and microRNA (miR)-195. The cell
 viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were determined by cell counting
 kit-8 assay, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation method, annexin V-fluorescein
 isothiocyanate/propidium iodide assay, respectively. Apoptosis- and
 autophagy-related proteins, as well as regulatory factors in the signaling
 pathways, were analyzed by Western blot method. The expression of miR-195 was
 quantified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
 RESULTS: The results confirmed that ailanthone was involved in the lung
 cancer cell progress by inhibiting cell viability and proliferation, but
 promoted cell apoptosis and autophagy. We also found that ailanthone
 upregulated the expression of miR-195. Further, the downregulated miR-195
 inhibited the apoptosis and autophagy induced by ailanthone. Moreover, our
 studies revealed that miR-195 inhibitor promoted the phosphorylation of PI3K,
 AKT, JAK, and STAT3, which was inhibited by ailanthone. CONCLUSION: All these
 findings suggest that ailanthone plays key roles in lung cancer progress and
 is closely correlated with miR-195 expression.",
