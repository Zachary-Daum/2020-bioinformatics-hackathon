    abstract "Osteoarthritis is the most frequent chronic bone and joint
 diseases in older populations all over the world. Lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS)-induced murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cell model has been widely used for
 testing new osteoarthritis therapeutic targets. This study aimed to explore
 the effects of microRNA-136 (miR-136) on LPS-induced ATDC5 cell injury and
 inflammatory cytokine expression, as well as underlying potential mechanism.
 We found that LPS remarkably inhibited ATDC5 cell viability, induced ATDC5
 cell apoptosis, and upregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines,
 including interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor
 alpha (TNF-alpha; P < .01 or  < .001). Moreover, LPS obviously upregulated
 the expression of miR-136 in ATDC5 cells (P < .05). Overexpression of miR-136
 markedly exacerbated the LPS-induced ATDC5 cell viability inhibition, cell
 apoptosis enhancement, and inflammatory cytokine expression (P < .05), and
 suppression of miR-136 had opposite effects (P < .05). Myeloid cell leukemia
 1 (Mcl-1) was a direct target gene of miR-136, which participated in the
 effect of miR-136 on LPS-induced ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury.
 Overexpression of Mcl-1 alleviated the LPS-induced inactivation of
 Wnt/beta-catenin and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
 transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathways, while suppression of Mcl-1 had
 opposite effects. To conclude, this study verified that miR-136 promoted
 LPS-induced ATDC5 cell injury and inflammatory cytokine expression by
 targeting Mcl-1, and Mcl-1 was involved in the regulatory effects of LPS on
 Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in ATDC5 cells.",
