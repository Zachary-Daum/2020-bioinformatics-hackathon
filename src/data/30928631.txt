    abstract "Ginsenoside Rg3, isolated from the roots of Panax ginseng, has
 been found to exert anti-cancer activity on multiple human cancers. However,
 there is no any literature available about the effect of Rg3 on oral squamous
 cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study investigated the possible anti-cancer
 effects of Rg3 on OSCC, as well as the possible molecular mechanisms. In
 vitro, cell viability and proliferation were respectively detected by CCK-8
 assay and BrdU assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI assay.
 Cell transfection was used to change the expression of miR-221 and TIMP3.
 qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to measure the expression of
 molecules involving in cell apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition
 (EMT) process, PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK/ERK pathway. In vivo, OSCC
 orthotopic murine model was established and tumor volumes were measured. We
 found that Rg3 treatment inhibited viability, proliferation and EMT process
 of human OSCC SCC-9 and HSC-5cells, but promoted cell apoptosis. miR-221 was
 highly expressed in OSCC tissues and cells. Rg3 reduced the expression of
 miR-221 in OSCC cells. Up-regulation of miR-221 abrogated the effects of Rg3
 on SCC-9 and HSC-5cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and EMT process.
 TIMP3 was lowly expressed in OSCC tissues and cells, which was a direct
 target gene of miR-221. Rg3 inactivated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways in
 SCC-9cells by up-regulating TIMP3. In vivo, Rg3 reduced the tumor volume of
 OSCC orthotopic murine model. In conclusion, Rg3 exerted anti-cancer effects
 on OSCC might be via down-regulating miR-221, up-regulating TIMP3, and then
 inactivating PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways.",
