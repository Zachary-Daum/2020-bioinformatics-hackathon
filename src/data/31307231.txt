    abstract "Geniposide is an active ingredient with anti-apoptotic and
 anti-inflammatory properties. This study was to examine the effects of
 geniposide on a cell model of spinal cord injury (SCI). PC12 cells were
 administrated with geniposide before subjected to LPS. The effects of
 geniposide were analyzed by utilizing CCK-8 assay, apoptosis assay, ELISA,
 RT-qPCR and Western blot. We found that PC12 cells viability was unchanged by
 treating with geniposide. However, geniposide with concentrations of 200 or
 300 mug/mL significantly mitigated LPS-evoked viability loss. Meanwhile,
 apoptosis driven by LPS was mitigated by geniposide, which accompanied with
 p53, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 down-regulation, and Bcl-2 up-regulation.
 Besides this, the expression and release of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and
 TNF-alpha evoked by LPS were mitigated by geniposide. miR-145-5p was a target
 of geniposide. miR-145-5p expression was up-regulated by geniposide, and
 geniposide did not protect PC12 cells against LPS injury when miR-145-5p was
 silenced. Moreover, geniposide inhibited NF-kappaB and JNK pathways via
 up-regulating miR-145-5p. In short, the present work described the
 neuroprotective effects of geniposide by targeting miR-145-5p. Further
 mechanisms involved in geniposide's beneficial effects are correlated with
 the inhibited NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Highlights Geniposide prevents
 LPS-induced injury in PC12 cells; Geniposide up-regulates miR-145-5p;
 Geniposide protects PC12 cells via up-regulation of miR-145-5p; Geniposide
 inhibits NF-kappaB and JNK pathways via up-regulation of miR-145-5p.",
