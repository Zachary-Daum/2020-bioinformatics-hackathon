    abstract "Recent papers suggest that oncogenic Ras participate in
 regulating tumour cells proliferation and metastasis. This work linked Ras
 with H1.4 modification in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), to better
 understand the oncogenic effects of Ras. A plasmid for expressing Ras mutated
 at G13D and T35S was transfected into NCI-H2126 and A549 cells.
 Phosphorylation of H1.4S36 was determined by immunoblotting. Effects of
 phosphorylation of H1.4 at serine (S) 36 (H1.4S36ph) on NCI-H2126 and A549
 cells were tested by MTT assay, soft-agar colony formation assay, flow
 cytometry and transwell assay. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and
 RT-qPCR were conducted to measure the effects of H1.4S36ph on Ras downstream
 genes. The catalyzing enzymes participate in H1.4S36 phosphorylation were
 further studied. We found that Ras-ERK signalling repressed the
 phosphorylation of H1.4 at S36. H1.4S36ph functioned as a tumour suppressor,
 as its overexpression repressed NCI-H2126 and A549 cells viability, colony
 formation, S-phase arrest, migration and invasion. H1.4S36ph was able to
 mediate the transcription of Ras downstream genes. Ras-ERK signalling
 repressed H1.4S36ph through degradation of PKA, and the degradation was
 mediated by MDM2. In conclusion, Ras-ERK signalling repressed H1.4
 phosphorylation at S36 to participate in NSCLC cells growth, migration and
 invasion. Ras-ERK signalling repressed H1.4S36ph through MDM2-dependent
 degradation of PKA. This study provides a novel explanation for Ras-ERK's
 tumour-promoting function. Highlights: H1.4S36 phosphorylation is repressed
 by Ras-ERK activation; H1.4S36ph inhibits the phenotype of NSCLC cells;
 H1.4S36ph regulates the transcription of Ras downstream genes; Ras-ERK
 represses H1.4S36ph by MDM2-dependent degradation of PKA.",
