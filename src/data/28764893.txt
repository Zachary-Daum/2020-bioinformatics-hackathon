    abstract "Several microRNAs (miRs) are associated with osteoarthritis (OA)
 and are also functionally implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. This
 study was aimed to investigate the potential roles of miR-203 in the
 development and progression of OA, as well as to illustrate the possible
 molecular mechanism. OA was simulated in human cartilage C28/I2 cells with
 treatments of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-induced cell injury was evaluated
 according to cell viability, apoptosis and release of pro-inflammatory
 cytokines. Expression of miR-203 after LPS treatment was assessed. Then,
 miR-203 was aberrantly expressed, followed by evaluation of LPS-induced cell
 injury. The target gene of miR-203 was virtually screened by bioinformatics
 method and verified by luciferase assay. Moreover, the potential associated
 signaling pathways were also investigated. Results showed that LPS induced
 decrease of cell viability and increases of cell apoptosis, release of
 inflammatory cytokines and expression of miR-203. LPS-induced alterations
 were aggravated by miR-203 overexpression but were alleviated by miR-203
 inhibition. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) was hypothesized and subsequently
 verified to be a target of miR-203, and miR-203 inhibition affected C28/I2
 cells through up-regulating MCL-1. In addition, LPS-induced down-regulations
 of key kinases as well as phosphorylated kinases were further down-regulated
 by miR-203 overexpression but were abrogated by miR-203 inhibition. In
 conclusion, this study suggests that miR-203 suppression may inhibit the
 progression of OA by targeting MCL-1 and activating the Wnt/beta-Catenin and
 JAK/STAT signal pathways.",
