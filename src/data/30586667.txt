    abstract "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a kind of degenerative
 disease characterized by the degeneration of the articular cartilage.
 Salidroside (SAL) is an active component of Rhodiola rosea L., which exhibits
 diverse pharmacological effects in different diseases. However, the effects
 of SAL on OA remain largely unclear. The study aimed to investigate the roles
 of SAL in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury in murine
 ATDC5 chondrocyte cells. METHODS: LPS induced ATDC5 cell injury model was
 constructed by determining cell viability, apoptosis, apoptosis-associated
 factors as well as inflammatory cytokines expressions and concentrations.
 Then, the various concentrations of SAL were used to treat ATDC5 cells, and
 the effect of SAL on LPS-induce inflammatory injury was detected. After
 treatment with SAL, the expression level of miR-145 was measured by qRT-PCR.
 Subsequently, miR-145 inhibitor and corresponding control were transfected
 into ATDC5 cells to explore the influences of miR-145 in LPS-induce
 inflammatory injury. Besides, the key signaling pathways of NF-kappaB and
 p38MAPK were analyzed by using western blot. RESULTS: LPS inhibited cell
 viability, induced apoptosis, activated cleaved-caspase-3/-9 expression, as
 well as increased IL-6, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha expressions and secretions in
 ATDC5 cells. SAL significantly alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury.
 Meanwhile, the expression of miR-145 was up-regulated by SAL. The protective
 effect of SAL on LPS-induced injury was obviously reversed by miR-145
 inhibition. Furthermore, SAL inactivated NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signaling
 pathways by regulating miR-145. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that
 SAL could protect ATDC5 cells against LPS-induced injury via up-regulation of
 miR-145 in ATDC5 chondrocyte cells.",
