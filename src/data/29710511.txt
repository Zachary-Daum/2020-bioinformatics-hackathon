    abstract "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate whether piperine has
 anti-inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory
 injury of murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cells and to explore the potential
 mechanisms. METHODS: ATDC5 cells were pretreated with piperine and then
 stimulated by LPS for 12h. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry
 were used to assess cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. qRT-PCR,
 enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting were used to
 detect the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, microRNA-127
 (miR-127) and MyD88, as well as key factors involved in nuclear factor kappa
 B (NF-kappaB) and p38-mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) signaling
 pathways, respectively. RESULTS: Piperine exerted anti-in fl ammatory effects
 on LPS-stimulated ATDC5 cells. Piperine reduced the expression of miR-127 in
 ATDC5 cells. Up-regulation of miR-127 aggravated LPS-induced inflammatory
 injury. Down-regulation of miR-127 had opposite effects. Moreover, miR-127
 up-regulated MyD88 expression and overexpression of MyD88 also aggravated
 LPS-induced cell inflammatory injury. Further research found that
 overexpression of MyD88 activated NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signaling pathways in
 ATDC5 cells, while knockdown of MyD88 inhibited the activation of these two
 pathways. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the anti-inflammatory effects
 of piperine on LPS-stimulated ATDC5 cells. The anti-inflammatory properties
 of piperine are mediated by down-regulating miR-127 and MyD88 expression and
 then inhibiting NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signaling pathways activation. Our
 findings may provide a theoretical basis for further research the clinical
 treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) by using piperine.",
