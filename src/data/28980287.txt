    abstract "BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) is partly due to
 myocardial cell damage caused by hypoxia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proved
 to be closely related to the development and progression of many
 cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the role of miR-145 in
 cardiomyocytes under hypoxic condition. METHODS: The quantitative real-time
 polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to test miR-145 expression
 in H9c2 cells with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-a abnormal expression under
 hypoxic condition. The 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
 bromide (MTT), Tran-swell assay and flow cytometry were used to investigate
 the effects of miR-145 on cell viability, migration and apoptosis under
 normoxic or hypoxic condition, respectively. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen
 species (ROS) content in hypoxic H9c2 cells was analyzed. Western blotting
 was used to explore the potential mechanism of miR-145 protective effects on
 cardiomyocytes. Expression levels of miR-145 and SGK1 in rat MI model were
 also assessed. RESULTS: Results showed that miR-145 was upregulated in H9c2
 and HL-1 cells under hypoxic condi-tion, which was promoted by HIF-1a.
 MiR-145 overexpression enhanced cell viability and migration under normoxic
 condition. Under hypoxic condition, miR-145 overexpression promoted cell
 viability, inhibited apoptosis and ROS activity. Western blotting results
 proved that miR-145 overexpression inhibited the activation of apoptotic
 related factors, and promoted activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via
 SGK1 upregulation. Expression levels of miR-145 and SGK1 were both
 upregulated in rat MI models. CONCLUSIONS: HIF-1a could induce miR-145
 upregulation in hypoxic H9c2 and HL-1 cells. MiR-145 protected H9c2 cells
 against hypoxic damage. SGK1 upregulation and activated PI3K/AKT may have
 participated in the protective effects of miR-145 on cardiomyocytes.",
