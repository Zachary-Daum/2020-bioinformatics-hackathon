    abstract "BACKGROUND: Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is a traditional
 Chinese herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory and anti-aging activities.
 OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effect and associated mechanisms
 of APS on LPS-induced injury in ATDC5 cells, to evaluate the potential of APS
 for use as an adjuvant therapy for osteoarthritis (OA). MATERIALS AND
 METHODS: ATDC5 cells were pre-treated with APS and stimulated with
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cell viability, ROS generation as well as the
 expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha, iNOS and Cox-2 were evaluated by performing
 CCK8 assay, ROS detection, ELISA, western blot and qRT-PCR. The expression of
 NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways related proteins and KLF4 was measured
 through western blot. RESULTS: LPS increased the expression of IL-6 and
 TNF-alpha, elevated the expression of Cox-2, iNOS and increased ROS
 generation. APS treatment significantly alleviated LPS-induced damage in
 ATDC5 cells. Besides, miR-92a was down-regulated while KLF4 was up-regulated
 by APS. At the same time, the targeting relationship between miR-92a and KLF4
 was demonstrated. The inhibitory effects of APS on LPS-induced injury in
 ATDC5 cells were attenuated by the combination of KLF4 siRNA. In addition,
 LPS induced NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways were decreased by APS
 treatment. Also, the inhibitory effect of APS on NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal
 pathways was reversed by KLF4 siRNA. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals
 that APS protects ATDC5 cells against LPS induced-injury by regulation of
 miR-92a/KLF4 axis and suppressing NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways.",
