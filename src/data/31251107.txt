    abstract "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes leading
 cause of blindness in adults. Salidroside (SAL) is a main ingredient from
 Rhodiola rosea L., has been reported to have a beneficial protection on
 vascular function. However, whether SAL is a suitable treatment for DR
 remains unreported. The study aimed to investigate the effect of SAL on
 high-glucose (HG)-induced injury in ARPE-19 cells. ARPE-19 cells were managed
 with diverse concentrations of glucose, and constructed a model of HG-induced
 ARPE-19 cells injury. Then, SAL was employed to stimulate ARPE-19 cells, and
 cell viability, apoptosis, apoptosis-associated factors, the pro-inflammatory
 cytokines, and ROS levels were determined. The correlation between miR-138
 and SIRT1 was predicated by bioinformatics software of TargetScan
 (http://www.targetscan.org/) and Dual luciferase reporter assay. MiR-138
 mimic, inhibitor and NCs were transfected into ARPE-19 cells, and the impacts
 of miR-138 on HG-induced cell injury were investigated. PI3K/AKT and AMPK
 signalling pathways were examined to explore the underlying mechanism. The
 results disclosed that HG inhibited cell viability, promoted apoptosis,
 up-regulated IL-6 and TNF-alpha, as well as increased ROS level in ARPE-19
 cells. But, SAL obviously alleviated HG-induced ARPE-19 cells injury.
 Repressed miR-138 was triggered by SAL, and SIRT1 was predicated as a direct
 target of miR-138. Overexpressed miR-138 declined the protective effect of
 SAL on HG-injured ARPE-19 cells. Besides, SAL activated PI3K/AKT and AMPK
 pathways by adjusting miR-138. In conclusions, SAL flattened HG-induced
 injury in ARPE-19 cells by repression of miR-138 and activating PI3K/AKT and
 AMPK pathways.",
