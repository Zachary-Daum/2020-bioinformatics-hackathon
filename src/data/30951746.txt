    abstract "AIMS: Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) have been reported
 to promote the proliferation of osteoblasts. Further, the proliferation of
 osteoblasts has been proved to be associated with microRNA (miR)-17 which
 targets phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) 3'-untranslated region (UTR)
 for regulating phosphoinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT)
 signaling pathway. Consequently, we aimed to explore a miR-17-relative
 mechanism by which LBPs mediates proliferation of osteoblasts. MATERIALS AND
 METHODS: LBPs were used to stimulate MC3T3-E1 cells, and SF1670 was applied
 to repress PTEN. miR-17 inhibitor was transfected into cells for
 down-regulating miR-17. The cell viability and migration were examined by
 cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and 24-well Transwell migration assay,
 respectively. The expression of Cyclin D1, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2
 and MMP-9 was analyzed using Western blot. Quantitative reverse transcription
 PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to detect miR-17. The expression of PTEN and
 phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT were analyzed by Western blot. KEY FINDINGS:
 We demonstrated that LBPs promoted osteoblasts viability, facilitated
 migration and positively regulated the expression of miR-17. Additionally,
 miR-17 inhibitor abolished the positive effects of LBPs on the osteoblasts.
 Molecularly, miR-17 inhibited the expression of PTEN by targeting its 3
'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Mechanically, LBPs diminished PTEN expression
 and facilitated the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, while the decreased
 expression of PTEN and enhanced phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT were reversed
 by miR-17 inhibitor. SIGNIFICANCE: LBPs might fortify osteoblasts viability
 by up-regulating miR-17 to target PTEN and consequently trigger PI3K/AKT
 pathway.",
