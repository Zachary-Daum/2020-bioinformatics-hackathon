    abstract "This study investigated the effects of tanshinol (TAN) on
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human keratinocytes inflammatory injury and
 underlying potential molecular mechanisms. Viability and apoptosis of HaCaT
 cells were assessed using MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining,
 respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
 was performed to measure the expression of microRNA-122 (miR-122) in HaCaT
 cells. Cell transfection was conducted to up-regulate the expression of
 miR-122. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of
 key factors involved in cell apoptosis, inflammatory response, c-Jun
 N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways. We
 found that LPS treatment induced HaCaT cell inflammatory injury by inhibiting
 cell viability, promoting cell apoptosis, and enhancing the protein
 expression levels of cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase.
 TAN treatment relieved LPS-induced HaCaT cell inflammatory injury. Moreover,
 TAN treatment attenuated LPS-induced activation of JNK and NF-kappaB pathways
 in HaCaT cells. Furthermore, TAN treatment alleviated LPS-induced
 up-regulation of miR-122. Overexpression of miR-122 reversed the effects of
 TAN on LPS-induced HaCaT cell inflammatory injury and activation of JNK and
 NF-kappaB pathways. In conclusion, TAN exerted anti-inflammatory and
 protective effects on keratinocytes injury. TAN relieved LPS-induced
 inflammatory injury of human HaCaT cells via down-regulating miR-122 and then
 inactivating JNK and NF-kappaB pathways.",
