    abstract "Context: H3(K18ac) is linked to gene expression and DNA damage.
 Nevertheless, whether H3(K18ac) participates in regulating
 Ras-ERK1/2-affected lung cancer cell phenotypes remains unclear. Objective:
 We explored the effects of H3(K18ac) on Ras-ERK1/2-affected lung cancer cell
 phenotypes. Material and methods: NCI-H2126 cells were transfected with,
 pEGFP-K-Ras(WT) and pEGFP-K-Ras(G12V/T35S) plasmids for 48 h, and
 transfection with pEGFP-N1 served as a blank control. Then H3(K18ac) and AKT
 and ERK1/2 pathways-associated factors were examined. Different amounts of
 the H3(K18Q) (0.5, 1, and 2 mug) plasmids and Ras(G12V/T35S) were
 co-transfected into NCI-H2126 cells, cell viability, cell colonies and
 migration were analyzed for exploring the biological functions of H3(K18ac)
 in NCI-H2126 cells. The ERK1/2 pathway downstream factors were detected by
 RT-PCR and ChIP assays. The regulatory functions of SIRT7, GCN5 and MDM2 in
 Ras-ERK1/2-regulated H3(K18ac) expression were finally uncovered. Results:
 Ras(G12V/T35S) transfection decreased the expression of H3(K18ac) about 2.5
 times compared with the pEGFP-N1 transfection group, and activated ERK1/2 and
 AKT pathways. Moreover, H3(K18ac) reduced cell viability, colonies,
 migration, and altered ERK1/2 downstream transcription in NCI-H2126 cells.
 Additionally, SIRT7 knockdown increased H3(K18ac) expression and repressed
 cell viability, migration and the percentage of cells in S phase by about 50%
 compared to the control group, as well as changed ERK1/2 downstream factor
 expression. Besides, Ras-ERK1/2 decreased H3(K18ac) was linked to
 MDM2-regulated GCN5 degradation. Conclusion: These observations disclosed
 that Ras-ERK1/2 promoted the development of lung cancer via decreasing
 H3(K18ac) through MDM2-mediated GCN5 degradation. These findings might
 provide a new therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.",
