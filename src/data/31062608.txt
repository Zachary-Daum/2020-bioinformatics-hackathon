    abstract "Thyroid cancer is widely diagnosed as malignancy in endocrine
 system. This study attempted to validate UCA1 possessed modulatory function
 on cell proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human
 thyroid cancer cell line TPC-1. Ectopic expression of UCA1 was induced in
 TPC-1 cells by transfection. CCK-8 assays were employed to value cell
 viability. Cell apoptosis analysis was conducted through flow cytometry. We
 found that overexpressed UCA1 strongly promoted cell proliferation. However,
 the knockdown of UCA1 suppressed cell proliferation and induced obvious cell
 apoptosis. Besides, cell EMT was promoted by overexpressed UCA1 and was
 inhibited by the knockdown of UCA1. Further study revealed that miR-15a level
 in TPC-1 cells was suppressed by overexpressed UCA1. Simultaneous
 overexpression of UCA1 and miR-15a partly alleviated UCA1-induced growth,
 identifying that miR-15a was a possible target of UCA1. At last, the Hippo
 and JNK signal pathways were activated by overexpressed UCA1 but were then
 weakened by the adding of miR-15a. In conclusion, our study revealed
 UCA1/miR-15a axis implicated in thyroid cancer cells EMT, exposing a novel
 mechanism of thyroid cancer progression.",
