    abstract "The aim of this study was to investigate the role and possible
 mechanism of long noncoding RNA ANRIL in the development of ulcerative
 colitis (UC). The expression of ANRIL in colonic mucosa tissues collected
 from the sigmoid colon of UC patients and healthy control was determined.
 Subsequently, fetal human cells (FHCs) were treated with lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS) to stimulate UC-caused inflammatory injury, followed by detection of
 the effects of suppression of ANRIL on cell viability, apoptosis and
 cytokines production in LPS-stimulated FHCs. Moreover, the regulatory
 relationship between ANRIL and miR-323b-5p as well as the target relationship
 between miR-323b-5p and TLR4 were investigated. Furthermore, the effects of
 ANRIL/miR-323b-5p axis on the activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway in
 LPS-stimulated FHCs were investigated. LncRNA ANRIL was highly expressed in
 colonic mucosa tissues of UC patients. In addition, LPS markedly induced cell
 injury in FHC cells (inhibited cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis and
 cytokine production). Suppression of ANRIL alleviated LPS-induced injury in
 FHC cells, which was achieved by negatively regulating miR-323b-5p. Moreover,
 miR-323b-5p negatively regulated TLR4 expression and TLR4 was a target of
 miR-323b-5p. Knockdown of TLR4 reversed the effects of miR-323b-5p
 suppression on LPS-induced injury in LPS-stimulated FHCs. Furthermore, the
 effects of ANRIL on LPS-induced cell injury were achieved by
 TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway. Our data indicate that suppression of ANRIL may
 inhibit the development of UC by regulating miR-323b-5p/TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB
 pathway. ANRIL/miR-323b-5p/TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway may provide a new
 strategy for UC therapy.",
