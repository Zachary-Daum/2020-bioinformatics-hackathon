    abstract "Medulloblastoma is a primitive neuroectodermal-derived brain
 tumor and the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Triptolide (TPL)
 is the major active component extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F.
 This study aimed to explore the effects of TPL on medulloblastoma cell
 proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, as well as the underlying possible
 molecular mechanism. Viability, proliferation, and apoptosis of Daoy cells
 were measured using cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine
 incorporation assay, and Guava Nexin assay, respectively. Cell migration was
 detected using two-chamber transwell assay and wound healing assay.
 Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was
 performed to determine the relative expression of microRNA-138 (miR-138) in
 Daoy cells. Cell transfection was used to change the expression of miR-138 in
 cells. Western blot analysis was used to analyze the expression of key
 factors involved in cell apoptosis, cell migration, the phosphatidylinositol
 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase 3 (AKT) pathway, and the Notch pathway in Daoy
 cells. We found that TPL significantly inhibited the viability,
 proliferation, and migration of Daoy cells but promoted Daoy cell apoptosis.
 The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 after
 TPL treatment were decreased. The expression of miR-138 in Daoy cells after
 TPL treatment was increased. Suppression of miR-138 obviously reversed the
 TPL-induced Daoy cell proliferation, migration inhibition, and cell apoptosis
 enhancement, as well as the inactivation of the PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways.
 Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) was a direct target gene of miR-138, which
 might be involved in the antitumor effects of TPL on Daoy cells. In
 conclusion, our study verified that TPL exerted anticancer effects on
 medulloblastoma cells possibly via upregulating miR-138 and inactivating the
 PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways.",
