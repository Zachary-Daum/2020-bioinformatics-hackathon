    abstract "Choriocarcinoma is a rare gestational trophoblastic tumour.
 Propofol is one of the commonly used intravenous anaesthetic agents and
 exerts an anti-tumour role in multiple cancers. However, the effect of
 propofol on choriocarcinoma has not been well explored. We investigated the
 effect of propofol on JEG-3 cells. The effects of propofol on cell
 proliferation and metastasis were determined. The expression of miR-495 was
 suppressed while Twist1 overexpressed. Cell viability, migration and invasion
 were respectively measured using CCK-8 assay and transwell migration/invasion
 assay. The expression of miR-495, AKT1 and Twist1 was detected using qRT-PCR.
 Western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression levels of EMT-
 and proliferation-related factors, and TGF-beta pathway proteins. Propofol
 treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion,
 and reduced the releasing of EMT. miR-495 was up-regulated by profocol, and
 miR-495 inhibition reversed the effect of propofol on cell proliferation and
 metastasis in JEG-3 cells. Furthermore, propofol decreased the expression of
 AKT1 and Twist1 through up-regulating miR-495, and Twist1 participated in the
 regulation of propofol on TGF-beta signalling inactivation in JEG-3 cells.
 This study demonstrates that propofol suppresses cell proliferation and
 metastasis through up-regulation of miR-495 and down-regulation of Twist1 in
 JEG3 cells. Highlights Propofol inhibits proliferation and metastasis in
 JEG-3 cells; miR-495 is up-regulated by propofol in JEG-3 cells; miR-495
 suppression blocks the effect of propofol in JEG-3 cells; Propofol decreases
 Twist1 expression through up-regulating miR-495; Propofol inhibits TGF-beta
 signalling via regulation of Twist1.",
