    abstract "Glioma is a serious malignant tumor without effective therapies
 till now. lncRNA PEG10 was reported to have some biological activities in
 cancers. Hence, we explored the effects of PEG10 on the human glioma cell
 line U251 cells. U251 cells were transfected with sh-PEG10 and/or miR-506
 inhibitor. The expression of PEG10 and miR-506 was measured by qRT-PCR. Cell
 viability, cell apoptosis, cell migration and invasion were detected by CCK-8
 assay, flow cytometry and Transwell chamber assay, respectively. The cell
 proliferation and apoptosis related p16, p53, Bcl-2, Bax, and
 pro-/Cleaved-Caspase-3/9, migration and invasion related-protein: matrix
 metalloproteinases MMP-2, MMP-9 and vimentin, and Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/STAT3
 pathways-related proteins were accessed by Western blot. Transfection with
 sh-PEG10 inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion, and increased cell
 apoptosis. Meanwhile, PEG10 silence upregulated the expression of p16 and
 p53, Bax, cleaved-Caspase-3/9 expression, and downregulated Bcl-2 expression.
 PEG10 silence upregulated miR-506 expression. Co-transfection with sh-PEG10
 and miR-506 inhibitor impaired the tumor suppressive effects. PEG10 knockdown
 decreased the phosphorylation of Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/STAT3-related proteins
 Raf, MEK, ERK, JAK1 and STAT3. PEG10 knockdown inhibited cell viability,
 migration and invasion, induced cell apoptosis through miR-506 upregulation,
 as well as inactivation of Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/STAT3 signal pathways.",
