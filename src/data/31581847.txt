    abstract "Myocardial ischemia is a serious disease which threatens human's
 life. Lentinan (LEN) possesses multiple biological properties: anticancer,
 antibacterial, antiviral and antioxidant effects. Our study investigated the
 effects of LEN on hypoxia-stimulated cardiomyocytes and the underlying
 mechanism. Primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (PNCM) were
 isolated from neonate rat pups. PNCM and H9c2 cells were stimulated by
 hypoxia and treated by LEN. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by
 cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. Moreover, apoptotic
 factors were examined by western blot. Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase
 (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and beta-catenin pathways related proteins were
 analyzed by western blot. Furthermore, the expression of microRNA-22 (miR-22)
 was detected by qRT-PCR. Altered expression of miR-22 and silenced
 information regulator 1 (Sirt1) was achieved by transfection. The
 relationship between miR-22 and Sirt1 was verified by luciferase assay. We
 found that LEN promoted cell viability and decreased apoptosis which led to
 the contrary results with what hypoxia induced. Moreover, LEN decreased the
 ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 and the level of cleaved caspase-3, as well as
 activated PI3K/AKT and beta-catenin. LEN decreased the expression of miR-22
 which was upregulated by hypoxia. miR-22 overexpression broken the promoting
 effects led by LEN. Moreover, Sirt1 was verified to be a target of miR-22.
 Silence of Sirt1 led to the opposite results with LEN. In conclusion, LEN
 relieved hypoxia-induced cellular injuries evidenced by increasing viability
 and decreasing apoptosis via down-regulation of miR-22, which was accompanied
 by activation of PI3K/AKT and beta-catenin pathways. Highlights Lentinan
 alleviates hypoxia-induced injuries of PNCM and H9c2 cells; microRNA-22
 expression is decreased by lentinan; Lentinan reduces hypoxia-induced injury
 by microRNA-22 downregulation; Lentinan regulates PI3K/AKT and
 Wnt/beta-catenin by regulation of microRNA-22/Sirt1.",
