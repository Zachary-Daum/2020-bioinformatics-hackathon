    abstract "Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is a major bioactive ingredient of
 Radix notoginseng that has promise in treating several diabetes-related
 diseases, like diabetic nephropathy and diabetic cardiomyopathy. This work is
 designed to explore if NGR1 has potential in treating diabetic peripheral
 neuropathy (DPN). A cell model of DPN was made by stimulating RSC96 cells
 with high glucose. The effects of NGR1 preconditioning were examined by
 conducting CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, ROS assay and Western blot. The
 downstream effector and signalling of NGR1 were then explored by qRT-PCR and
 Western blot. High glucose incubation led to cell viability loss, apoptosis
 facilitation, caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, and ROS generation of RSC96 cells.
 Meanwhile, expression of NGF and BDNF was declined by high glucose.
 Preconditioning NGR1 significantly protected RSC96 cells against high
 glucose-evoked damage. And NGR1 prevented high glucose-induced expression of
 miR-503. The beneficial functions of NGR1 towards high glucose-injured RSC96
 cells were impeded by miR-503 overexpression. Further, NGR1 activated
 PI3K/AKT and beta-catenin signalling through a miR-503-dependent way. This
 paper illustrated the neuroprotective and neurotrophic function of NGR1 in
 RSC96 cells. The beneficial function may due to its regulation on miR-503
 expression and the downstream signalling such as PI3K/AKT and beta-catenin.",
