    abstract "Gastric cancer (GC) is a serious disease with high incidence
 rate and high mortality. Geniposide (GEN) exhibits multiple biological
 properties including anti-tumor function. However, effect of GEN on GC is not
 well studied. Hence, the effects of GEN on GC were investigated in our study.
 HULC expression in GC tissue and GC cell lines (MKN45, SGC-7901, MKN28, AGS)
 was detected by qRT-PCR. Cell viability, colony formation, migration,
 invasion and cell apoptosis were examined by CCK-8 assay, survival fraction
 assay, modified two-chamber migration assay, Millicell Hanging Cell Culture
 and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The expression of matrix
 metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 and vimentin was detected by qRT-PCR and western
 blot, respectively. The expression of PI3K/AKT and JNK was measured by
 western blot. The expression of HULC was up-regulated both in GC tissue and
 cell lines (P<.05, P<.01 or P<.001). GEN negatively regulated the expression
 of HULC in MKN45 cells (P<.05 or P<.01). GEN decreased cell viability
 (P<.05), colony formation (P<.01), migration (P<.05) and invasion (P<.05)
 while HULC overexpression led to the opposite results in GEN-treated cells.
 The expression of phosphatidylinositol 3' -kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B
 (AKT) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was down-regulated by GEN (all P<.05)
 while reversed by HULC overexpression. HULC was up-regulated in GC. GEN
 inhibited MNK45 cell viability, colony formation, migration and invasion
 while induced cell apoptosis by down-regulation of HULC in MKN45 cells. GEN
 inactivated PI3K/AKT and JNK signal pathways through down-regulation of HULC.",
