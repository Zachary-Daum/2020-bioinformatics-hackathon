    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant
 tumors in women with high mortality. Recent evidences have demonstrated that
 Ailanthone (AIL) could effectively inhibit tumor growth. However, whether AIL
 exerts anti-tumor effect on breast cancer remains unclear. The study aimed to
 investigate the effect of AIL on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and
 invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells. METHODS: After treatment with different
 concentrations (0-25 muM) of AIL, cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay,
 and 10 muM AIL was noted as the optimum concentration for the following
 experiments. Then, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and
 relative protein levels were examined by BrdU, flow cytometry, Transwell
 assays, and western blot, respectively. The expression vectors of miR-148a
 mimic, miR-148a inhibitor were transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells, and the
 above experiments were determined again. The signal pathways of AMPK and
 Wnt/beta-catenin were finally analyzed by western blot assay. RESULTS: Cell
 viability was significantly decreased by AIL in a dose-dependent way.
 Moreover, AIL reduced the proliferation rate, and modulated CyclinD1, p53 and
 p21 expressions. AIL remarkably induced cell apoptosis with an increase in
 cleaved-Caspase-3/-9 expressions. Further, cell migration and invasion were
 decreased after treatment of AIL in MDA-MB-231 cells. AIL significantly
 up-regulated miR-148a expression. The effect of AIL on MDA-MB-231 cells was
 significantly enhanced by miR-148a overexpression, but reversed by miR-148a
 inhibition. Besides, we found that AIL blocked AMPK and Wnt/beta-catenin
 signal pathways by regulating miR-148a. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated
 that AIL inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells
 by regulating miR-148a.",
