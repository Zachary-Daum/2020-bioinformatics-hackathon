    abstract "Pediatric myocarditis (PM) is usually related to myocardial
 dysfunction. Generally, 30% of PM patients will die or undergo heart
 transplantation. Swainsonine (SW) is a natural alkaloid and an anti-cancer
 substance. Our goal was to determine the roles of SW in PM in current study.
 H9c2 cells were pre-treated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Viability and
 apoptosis were evaluated utilizing CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry.
 Inflammatory cytokines' mRNA expression and production were assessed by
 western blot and ELISA. Western blot was utilized to distinguish apoptosis
 and immune-related factors expression. Sequentially, the abovementioned
 parameters were reassessed when miR-429 was overexpressed. LPS declined
 viability as well as raised apoptosis and inflammatory injury in H9c2 cells.
 SW alleviated apoptosis and inflammatory injury induced by LPS. MiR-429
 expression was elevated by LPS and suppressed by SW. SW-induced the
 increasing of viability and the reduction of inflammatory injury were
 reversed by overexpression of miR-429. Eventually, SW inhibited
 p38MAPK/NF-kappaB pathway which activated by LPS via overexpressing miR-429.
 SW exerted its anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory function in LPS-treated
 H9c2 cells through p38MAPK/NF-kappaB pathway and down-regulation of miR-429.",
