    abstract "The purpose of our study was aimed to determine the functional
 role of microRNA (miR)-182 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and try
 to clarify its underlying molecular mechanism. Expression of miR-182 in both
 cancer and peripheral blood samples was analyzed by quantitative real-time
 PCR (qRT-PCR). Human RCC line Caki-1 cells were transfected with miR-182
 mimic, miR-182 inhibitor, or negative controls, and then the cell viability,
 colony-formation ability, migration, and invasion assay were determined.
 Luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to
 determine whether insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) was a target
 of miR-182. Further, small interfering RNA (siRNA) against IGF1R was
 co-transfected with miR-182 inhibitor into cells, and then the effects on
 migration and invasion were assessed. MiR-182 was down-regulated in both
 cancer and blood samples compared to the matched non-tumor adjacent tissues
 and healthy volunteers, respectively (both P<0.05). Compared to the control
 group, cell viability, colony-forming ability, and numbers of migrated and
 invaded cells were significantly decreased by transfection with miR-182 mimic
 but were markedly increased by miR-182 inhibitor (all P < 0.05). Luciferase
 reporter assay confirmed that IGF1R was a target gene of miR-182, and IGF1R
 was negatively regulated by miR-182. Co-transfection of miR-182 inhibitor
 with si-IGF1R reversed the effect of miR-182 inhibitor on the migration and
 invasion of the cells. MiR-182 functions as an anti-oncogene in ccRCC, and
 miR-182-mediated inhibition of cell migration and invasion might be through
 directly targeting IGF1R.",
