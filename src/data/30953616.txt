    abstract "Geniposide (GEN) is an iridoid glycoside extracts from Gardenia
 jasminoides Ellis with antioxidant and anti-inflammarory properties. The
 objective of this study was to explore the effects of GEN on a cell model of
 myocardial infarction (MI). After transfection, hypoxia-stimulated H9c2 cells
 were treated with GEN. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by Cell
 Counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Cell cycle-,
 apoptosis- and signal pathway related proteins were examined by Western blot.
 The expression of THRIL was determined by qRT-PCR. In addition, in vivo
 experiments were performed in rats. Then the infarct size and the left
 ventricular (LV) end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV ejection fraction (LVEF)
 and LV fractional shortening (LVFS) were monitored. Results showed that
 treating H9c2 cells with GEN attenuated hypoxia-induced cell damage as cell
 viability was increased, and cell apoptosis was repressed. Meanwhile, THRIL
 was found to be down-regulated by GEN. The cardioprotective effects of GEN on
 H9c2 cells were attenuated when THRIL was overexpressed. Besides this, the
 phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, JAK1 and STAT3 were up-regulated by GEN while
 down-regulated by THRIL overexpression. Moreover, GEN decreased infarct size
 and LVEDD, while increased LVEF and LVFS. Taken together, this study
 demonstrated that GEN alleviated cardiomyocytes damage and cardiac
 dysfunction possible through down-regulation of THRIL.",
