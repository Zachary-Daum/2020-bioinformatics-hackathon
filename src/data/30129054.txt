    abstract "BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1
 (UCA1) has been reported to be a vital mediator in various cancers. But, in
 terms of gastric cancer (GC), the effects of UCA1 on GC cell proliferation,
 migration, invasion, and apoptosis remain unclear. This study aimed to
 uncover the potential regulatory mechanism of UCA1 in GC cells. METHODS: The
 expression level of UCA1 was first examined in the five different cell lines
 of HEK293, CCL-153, HUVEC, SUN-216, and SGC-7901 using a
 reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Then, the
 vectors of short hairpin UCA1, the microRNA-182 (miR-182) mimic/inhibitor,
 and the pEX-tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2)/small
 interfering TIMP2 were transfected into SUN-216 and SGC-7901 cells to alter
 UCA1, miR-182, and TIMP2 expression. To investigate the biological functions,
 cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were examined by Cell
 Counting Kit-8, Transwell, and flow cytometry. The key factors of apoptosis
 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen synthase
 kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signal pathways
 were determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: UCA1 was upregulated in
 SUN-216 and SGC-7901 cells than in the other three cell lines of HEK293,
 CCL-153, and HUVEC. Knockdown of UCA1 significantly suppressed cell
 viability, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis by regulating
 B-cell lymphoma 2, Bax, and cleaved-caspase-3/9 expressions. However, miR-182
 overexpression markedly reversed the regulatory effect of UCA1 knockdown on
 SUN-216 and SGC-7901 cells. TIMP2 was a direct target gene of miR-182, and
 TIMP2 overexpression exhibited the same effect of UCA1 knockdown on cell
 viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Besides, miR-182 activated
 PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta and NF-kappaB signal pathways by regulation of TIMP2.
 CONCLUSION: Knockdown of UCA1 exerts an anticancer effect on GC cells by
 regulating miR-182.",
