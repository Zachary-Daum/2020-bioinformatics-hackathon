    abstract "Gastric cancer remains a serious threat to human health
 worldwide. Kaempferol is a plant-derived flavonoid compound with a wide range
 of pharmacological activities. This study aimed to investigate the effects of
 kaempferol on gastric cancer SNU-216 cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
 autophagy, as well as underlying potential mechanisms. Viability,
 proliferation, and apoptosis of SNU-216 cells after kaempferol treatment were
 evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-btomo-2'-deoxyuridine
 incorporation assay, and annexin V-FITC/PI staining, respectively.
 Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed to measure the mRNA
 expressions of cyclin D1 and microRNA-181a (miR-181a) in SNU-216 cells. Cell
 transfection was used to down-regulate the expression of miR-181a. The
 protein expression levels of cyclin D1, bcl-2, bax, caspase 3, caspase 9,
 autophagy-related gene 7, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-I
 (LC3-I), LC3-II, Beclin 1, p62, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
 extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), and phosphatidylinositol 3
 kinase (PI3K) in SNU-216 cells were detected using western blotting. Results
 showed that kaempferol significantly suppressed SNU-216 cell viability and
 proliferation but had no influence on cell apoptosis. Further results
 suggested that kaempferol significantly induced SNU-216 cell autophagy. The
 expression of miR-181a in SNU-216 cells after kaempferol treatment was
 enhanced. Kaempferol significantly inactivated MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways in
 SNU-216 cells. Suppression of miR-181a significantly reversed the
 kaempferol-induced MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways inactivation in SNU-216 cells.
 This research demonstrated that kaempferol suppressed proliferation and
 promoted autophagy of human gastric cancer SNU-216 cells by up-regulating
 miR-181a and inactivating MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways.",
