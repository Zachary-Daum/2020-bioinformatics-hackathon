    abstract "BACKGROUND: Astragalus membranaceus has been clinically used in
 cerebral ischemia treatment in China and its main component, Astragaloside IV
 (Ast IV) shows anti-hypoxia activity, but the underlying mechanism has not
 been clearly clarified. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of
 Ast IV on hypoxia-induced injury in PC-12 cells as well as the underlying
 mechanism. METHODS: Relative miR-124 expression was detected by qRT-PCR.
 Hic-5 expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. To alter miR-124
 and Hic-5 expressions, cells were respectively transfected with miR-124 mimic
 and pEX-Hic-5. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by BrdU assay
 and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) double
 staining method, respectively. Besides, apoptotic proteins and cell
 proliferation-associated factors were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Ast
 IV alleviated hypoxia-induced injury in PC-12 cells by decreasing apoptosis
 (P< 0.01). Ast IV inhibited up-regulation of miR-124 induced by hypoxia (P<
 0.01). miR-124 mimic impaired the anti-apoptotic effect of Ast IV on PC-12
 cells (P< 0.01). Hic-5 expression was significantly down-regulated in miR-124
 overexpressed cells (P< 0.001) and Hic-5 overexpression activated
 Sp1/Survivin signaling pathway (P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Ast IV could
 ameliorate hypoxia-induced injury in PC-12 cells by decreasing miR-124
 expression and then up-regulating Hic-5 expression.",
