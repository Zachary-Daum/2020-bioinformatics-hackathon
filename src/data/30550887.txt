    abstract "AIMS: PMS1 Homolog 2, Mismatch Repair System Component
 Pseudogene 2 (PMS2L2) has been reported as an up-regulated long non-coding
 RNA (lncRNA) in osteoarthritis (OA) tissues. The purpose of the present work
 is to explore whether the differently expressed PMS2L2 is associated with the
 pathogenesis of OA. MAIN METHODS: Chondrogenic ATDC5 cells were exposed to
 various doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The expression of PMS2L2, miR-203,
 and MCL-1 in cell was altered by transfection. Thereafter, cell viability,
 apoptosis, the expression changes of apoptosis-related factors and the
 release of pro-inflammatory factors were respectively assessed. Moreover, the
 regulatory relationship between PMS2L2 and miR-203, as well as between
 miR-203 and MCL-1 were studied. KEY FINDINGS: PMS2L2 expression was
 down-regulated following LPS stimulation. PMS2L2 protected ATDC5 cells
 against LPS-induced injury by increasing cell viability, decreasing
 apoptosis, and repressing the release of pro-inflammatory factors. Meanwhile,
 PMS2L2 increased the expression levels of COL2A1 and ACAN, while
 down-regulated the expression levels of MMP13 and ADAMTS-5. PMS2L2 worked as
 a molecular sponge for miR-203. Besides, miR-203 overexpression partially
 abolished the chondroprotective effects of PMS2L2. MCL-1 was a direct target
 of miR-203, and it exerted the similarly chondroprotective effects as PMS2L2.
 Furthermore, PMS2L2 and MCL-1 blocked Wnt/beta-Catenin and JAK/STAT signaling
 pathways also via a miR-203-dependent manner. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study reveals
 a protective role of PMS2L2 in LPS-induced inflammatory injury in
 chondrocytes. PMS2L2/miR-203/MCL-1 axis may serve as a new gene therapy
 strategy for the treatment of OA.",
