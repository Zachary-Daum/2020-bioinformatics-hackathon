    abstract "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint
 disease, which seriously impacts the health of elderly. However, there is no
 effective treatment for curing this disease until now. Numerous studies
 reported that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related to the
 pathogenesis of OA. Therefore, the study aims to investigate the effect of
 maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
 inflammatory injury of ATDC5 cells. METHODS: Different concentrations (0, 1,
 5, and 10mug/ml) of LPS were used to induce ATDC5 cells injury. The specific
 expressing vectors were then transfected into ATDC5 cells to alter MEG3,
 Sirt1 and miR-203 expressions. Flow cytometry, luciferase reporter, qRT-PCR
 and western blot assays were used to detect cell viability, apoptosis, and
 the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins and pro-inflammatory factors
 (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha). Meanwhile, ELISA was used for analyzing
 the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in culture supernatant. Besides,
 the key pathways of PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB were examined by western blot.
 RESULTS: LPS decreased cell viability, increased cell apoptosis, promoted the
 release of pro-inflammatory factors, and down-regulated MEG3 expression,
 Moreover, MEG3 knockdown alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury. MEG3
 acted as a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) for miR-203, and MEG3 knockdown
 reduced inflammatory injury by regulating miR-203. Furthermore, miR-203
 positively regulated Sirt1 expression, and Sirt1 alleviated LPS-induced
 inflammatory injury via mediating PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways.
 CONCLUSION: This study showed that MEG3 knockdown alleviated LPS-induced
 inflammatory injury in ATDC5 cells by regulating miR-203 expression. Hence,
 the findings may offer a potential treatment perspective of OA.",
