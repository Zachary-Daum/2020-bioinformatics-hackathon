    abstract "BACKGROUND: Ailanthone (AIL) is a quassinoid isolated from
 traditional Chinese herbal medicine Ailanthus altissima. The anti-tumor
 activities of AIL have been reported in various solid tumors. This study
 aimed to reveal the in vitro effect of AIL on acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
 cells. METHODS: The effects of AIL on five AML cell lines (KG1, HL60, U-937,
 THP-1 and OCI-AML2) as well as myeloid progenitor cells were evaluated by
 performing CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assay and Western blotting.
 KG1 and HL60 cells were transfected with miR-449a inhibitor or its negative
 control, and then were treated by AIL. The above mentioned assays were
 performed again to study the involvement of miR-449a in AIL's function.
 RESULTS: AIL dose-dependently inhibited the viability of AML cells and
 myeloid progenitor cells. The IC50 value of AIL towards KG1 and HL60 cells
 was 0.58 and 0.57muM, respectively. AIL with concentration of 0.5muM
 significantly induced the apoptosis of AML cells rather than myeloid
 progenitor cells. Meanwhile, 0.5muM AIL significantly reduced migration and
 invasion of AML cells. miR-449a was highly expressed in response to the
 treatment of 0.5muM AIL. Besides this, the anti-tumor activities of AIL in
 AML cells were attenuated by miR-449a silence. Further, the blockage of Notch
 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways induced by AIL was reversed by miR-449a
 silence. CONCLUSION: AIL restrained AML cells growth, migration and invasion
 through up-regulation of miR-449a, and deactivation of Notch and PI3K/AKT
 signaling pathways.",
