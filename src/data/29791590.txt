    abstract "Thyroid cancer is a common malignant tumor. Long non-coding RNA
 colon cancer-associated transcript 1 (lncRNA CCAT1) is highly expressed in
 many cancers; however, the molecular mechanism of CCAT1 in thyroid cancer
 remains unclear. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of CCAT1
 on human thyroid cancer cell line FTC-133. FTC-133 cells were transfected
 with CCAT1 expressing vector, CCAT1 shRNA, miR-143 mimic, and miR-143
 inhibitor, respectively. After different treatments, cell viability,
 proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were measured. Moreover,
 the regulatory relationship of CCAT1 and miR-143, as well as miR-143 and VEGF
 were tested using dual-luciferase reporter assay. The relative expressions of
 CCAT1, miR-143, and VEGF were tested by qRT-PCR. The expressions of
 apoptosis-related factors and corresponding proteins in PI3K/AKT and MAPK
 pathways were analyzed using western blot analysis. The results suggested
 that CCAT1 was up-regulated in the FTC-133 cells. CCAT1 suppression decreased
 FTC-133 cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and miR-143
 expression, while it increased apoptosis and VEGF expression. CCAT1 might act
 as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-143. Moreover, CCAT1 activated
 PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways through inhibition of miR-143. This
 study demonstrated that CCAT1 exhibited pro-proliferative and pro-metastasis
 functions on FTC-133 cells and activated PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways
 via down-regulation of miR-143. These findings will provide a possible target
 for clinical treatment of thyroid cancer.",
