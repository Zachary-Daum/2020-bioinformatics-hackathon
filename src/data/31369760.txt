    abstract "BACKGROUND: Cisplatin resistance has been found to contribute to
 the failure of ovarian carcinoma treatment. Oridonin is a natural en-kaurane
 tetracyclic diterpenoid compound discovered in Rabdosia rubescene (Henmsl.)
 Hara. Herein, we tested whether oridonin could exert chemo-sensitization
 activity on cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells. METHODS: Firstly,
 A2780CP cells and SKOV3/DDP cells were exposed to cisplatin and/or oridonin
 treatment. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) kit and Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with
 Annexin V-FITC and PI were carried out to test cell viability and apoptosis,
 respectively. Then, pBeclin-1 was transfected to overexpress Beclin-1.
 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) acted as autophagy inhibitor, while rapamycin acted as
 autophagy activator. Finally, the influence of cisplatin and/or oridonin
 treatment on human normal ovarian epithelial IOSE 364 cell viability and
 apoptosis were also detected. RESULTS: Oridonin incubation notably elevated
 the cisplatin-caused reduction of A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell viabilities and
 enhancement of cell apoptosis. Cisplatin-caused A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell
 autophagy was dramatically inhibited by oridonin. Overexpression of Beclin-1
 mitigated the influence of oridonin on cisplatin-caused A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP
 cell autophagy. Inhibition of cell autophagy by 3-MA promoted the
 oridonin+cisplatin-caused A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell apoptosis, while
 activation of cell autophagy by rapamycin had opposite effects. Oridonin and
 cisplatin co-treatment had no significant effects on IOSE 364 cell viability
 and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The chemo-sensitization activity of oridonin on
 cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells was verified in this study.
 Oridonin elevated sensitivity of ovarian carcinoma cells to cisplatin via
 suppressing cisplatin-mediated autophagy.",
