    abstract "Rectal cancer is the frequent malignant tumor of the digestive
 tract. It has a strong ability to invade and metastasize, a poor clinical
 prognosis and a high recurrence rate. Circular RNA mitochondrial translation
 optimization 1 homolog (circMTO1) exerts functions of regulating tumor
 development. Thus, we aimed to investigate the roles and mechanisms of
 circMTO1 in rectal cancer. Cell activity, proliferation, migration, and
 incursion were tested through cell counting kit-8, bromodeoxyuridine, flow
 cytometry, transwell, and BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers, separately.
 Expression of circMTO1 and other relative factors was tested through
 quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and
 Western blot. qRT-PCR revealed that circMTO1 expression was notably reduced
 in rectal cancer tissues. Overexpression of circMTO1 was established in SW837
 and SNU-61 cells. Then we found that circMTO1 overexpression could suppress
 cell proliferation, migration, and incursion and induce apoptosis through
 downregulating miR-19b-3p. However, these trends were opposite in both cells
 when circMTO1 was knocked down. Besides, circMTO1 overexpression inhibited
 Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
 (STAT3) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signal pathways via
 negatively regulating miR-19b-3p to play its antitumor roles. circMTO1 acted
 as a tumor inhibitor influencing the growth, migration, and incursion of
 rectal cancer cells and JAK1/STAT3 and AMPK signal pathways through
 downregulating miR-19b-3p.",
