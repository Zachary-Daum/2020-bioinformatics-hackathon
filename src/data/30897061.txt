    abstract "Pancreatitis is a disease caused by inflammation of pancreatic
 acinar cells. Geniposide (GEN) possesses anti-inflammation activities. Hence,
 we investigated the effects of GEN on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated
 AR42J cells. AR42J cells were stimulated by LPS and then treated with GEN
 and/or transfected with miR-27a mimic or negative control. Cell viability and
 cell apoptosis were detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow
 cytometry, respectively. All related proteins were measured by Western blot.
 The expression of miR-27a was detected by quantitative real time-polymerase
 chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, the expression of inflammatory cytokines
 interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 was
 analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. LPS significantly decreased cell
 viability, and enhanced cell apoptosis and IL-6, MCP-1 expression. Then GEN
 administration alleviated inflammatory injury by increasing cell viability,
 while reducing apoptosis, and IL-6 and MCP-1 expression. GEN downregulated
 miR-27a expression which was induced by LPS. Transfection with miR-27a mimic
 partially eliminated the protective effects of GEN. The phosphorylation of
 JNK and c-Jun was downregulated by GEN while upregulated by miR-27a
 overexpression. GEN alleviates LPS-induced AR42J cell injury as evidenced by
 promoting cell growth, and upregulation of IL-6 and MCP-1. This process might
 be modulated by down-regulating miR-27a and inactivation of JNK pathway.",
