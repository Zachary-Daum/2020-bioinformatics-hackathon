    abstract "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA), a universal chronic
 musculoskeletal disorder, is closely related to inflammation. More effective
 drugs for improving OA outcome are definitely needed. Herein, we attempted to
 verify the protective role of green tea polyphenols (GTP) after treatment
 with murine in ATDC5 cells to reveal the regulatory mechanism. METHODS: ATDC5
 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic an inflammatory
 response during OA. Cell activity, apoptosis, levels of relative proteins,
 and prophlogistic factors were tested via a Cell Counting Kit-8 experiment, a
 flow cytometry experiment, western blot, and RT-qPCR (ELISA and Western
 blot), separately. miR-9 level was detected by RT-qPCR and altered via miR-9
 mimic and inhibitor transfection. We finally studied MAPK and NF-kappaB
 pathways in GTP-related modulations using western blot. RESULTS: LPS caused
 inflammatory cell damage in ATDC5 cells, showing decreased cell activity,
 enhanced apoptosis, and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. GTP
 pretreatments could significantly attenuate LPS-induced alterations. In
 addition, LPS-induced miR-9 upregulation was further positively regulated in
 ATDC5 cells. The effects of GTP pretreatments in LPS-caused ATDC5 cells were
 enhanced via miR-9 upregulation, whereas they were reduced via miR-9
 suppression. Finally, we found that GTP pretreatments could suppress the MAPK
 and NF-kappaB pathways through miR-9 regulation. CONCLUSION: GTP
 pretreatments attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory response accompanied by the
 suppression of the MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways via positively regulating
 miR-9 in ATDC5 cells.",
