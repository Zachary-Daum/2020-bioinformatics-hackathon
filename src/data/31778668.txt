    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Liver cancer is distinguished as an
 irredeemable disease. We detected the geniposide (GEN) in HepG2 and Huh7 cell
 lines. METHODS: HepG2 and Huh7 cells were individually induced with GEN
 dilutions, and then they were transfected with microRNA (miR)-224
 overproduction vector (miR-224 mimic) as well as the corresponding negative
 control (NC). Cell viability was detected with the CCK-8. The apoptotic rate
 was determined by the Annexin V-FITC/PI with flow cytometer. The migration or
 invasion rates were separately determined by migration assay or millicell
 hanging cell culture. The expression of miR-224 was quantified depending on
 qRT-PCR. Relative proteins were individually determined via western blot.
 RESULTS: GEN treatment induced inhibition of HepG2 and Huh7 cells
 proliferation, migration and invasion but promotion of apoptosis. miR-224 was
 down-regulated by GEN. Transfection of miR-224 mimic led to high expression
 of miR-224, which partly rescued cancer cells survival by prohibiting cell
 apoptosis. Moreover, the production of Wnt/beta-catenin and AKT proteins was
 notably reduced by GEN but increased by overexpressed miR-224. CONCLUSION:
 GEN played anti-tumor roles by targeting miR-224 via blocking the
 Wnt/beta-catenin and AKT cascades in the HepG2 and Huh7 cells.",
