    abstract "Laryngocarcinoma is the most common head and neck cancer and has
 a high incidence and mortality, causing about 83 000 deaths per year
 worldwide. Our research aimed to investigate the possible role of long
 noncoding RNA (lncRNA) taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in laryngocarcinoma
 development. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of TUG1 in tumor tissues and
 control (plasma) samples of laryngocarcinoma patients as well as in
 laryngocarcinoma cells were detected. The influences of TUG1 suppression on
 cell biological processes (viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion) and
 cytoskeleton rearrangement in laryngocarcinoma cells were tested. Moreover,
 we investigated the regulatory interaction between TUG1 and miR-145-5p, and
 identified the target gene of miR-145-5p. The association between TUG1 and
 the protein expressions of RhoA/rho associated coiled-coil containing protein
 kinase (ROCK)/matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) pathway-associated factors
 were detected. TUG1 was found to be highly expressed in tumor tissues and
 plasma samples of laryngocarcinoma patients as well as in laryngocarcinoma
 cells. Suppression of TUG1 decreased laryngocarcinoma cell viability,
 increased apoptosis, and suppression migration, invasion, and cytoskeleton
 rearrangement. Moreover, TUG1 negatively regulated miR-145-5p. TUG1 regulated
 tumor growth (viability and apoptosis) and metastasis through miR-145-5p.
 Furthermore, ROCK1 was targeted by miR-145-5p, and miR-145-5p/ROCK1 partner
 was involved in the process of tumor growth and metastasis. Finally, we found
 that TUG1 functioned on laryngocarcinoma by activating RhoA/ROCK/MMPs
 pathway. Our study reveals that lncRNA TUG1 is upregulated in
 laryngocarcinoma and may be involved in the process of laryngocarcinoma
 through miR-145-5p downregulation and activating the RhoA/ROCK/MMPs signals.",
