    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Endometrial cancer (EC) is ranked as the most common
 gynecologic malignancy of the female genital tract and the fourth most common
 neoplasia in women. Accumulated evidences reveal that TRAF4 plays a critical
 role in the progress of various cancers, but its functions in EC remains
 unclear. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of TRAF4 in EC
 progress. METHODS: TRAF4 expression in EC tissues were assessed by qRT-PCR,
 IHC and western blot. TRAF4 expression in Ishikawa and primary EC cells was
 inhibited and overexpressed by transient transfections. Thereafter, cell
 proliferation was identified by combination of clone formation assay and Ki67
 staining assay. Cell viability, apoptosis and migration were respectively
 measured by MTT assay, flow cytometry assay and transwell migration assay.
 Furthermore, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were mainly performed to
 assess the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and PI3K/AKT/Oct4
 pathway proteins. RESULTS: TRAF4 was up-regulated in EC tissues. Knockdown of
 TRAF4 induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation and migration.
 However, TRAF4 overexpression increased cell proliferation and migration.
 Furthermore, we found TRAF4 down-regulation repressed the activation of
 PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in Ishikawa and primary EC cells. We also found
 that Oct4 was a downstream factor of PI3K/AKT pathway and was positively
 regulated by TRAF4. TRAF4 might increase cell viability through PI3K/AKT/Oct4
 pathway. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that TRAF4 might exert an
 oncogenic role in EC progress via its regulation of PI3K/AKT/Oct4 pathway.",
