    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is known to be involved in
 cartilage degeneration following joint injury or due to osteoarthritis. In
 the present study, we explored the effects of miR-150 on IL-1-stimulated
 human chondrogenic cells ATDC5. METHODS: ATDC5 cells were transfected with
 the mimic, inhibitor or negative controls specific for miR-150, and
 subsequently treated by IL-1. CCK8 assay, PI and FITC-conjugated Annexin V
 double-staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR and ELISA assay were performed to
 determine the changes of cell viability, apoptosis, and the release of
 pro-inflammatory cytokines. Targeting relationship between miR-150 and KLF2
 was detected by dual luciferase activity assay. RESULTS: IL-1 reduced cell
 viability, induced apoptosis, and enhanced the expression and release of
 pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha) in ATDC5 cells. IL-1
 also increased the expression of miR-150. Suppression of miR-150 alleviated
 IL-1-induced cell damage in ATDC5 cells, while overexpression of miR-150
 resulted in an opposite impact. KLF2 was negatively regulated by miR-150, and
 it was proved as a target gene of miR-150. KLF2 overexpression exhibited
 protective actions in IL-1-injured ATDC5 cells, even if miR-150 was
 suppressed in cell. Moreover, IL-1-induced activation of NF-kB and Notch
 pathways was alleviated by KLF2 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of
 miR-150 led to up-regulation of KLF2, which in turn protected ATDC5 cells
 against IL-1-induced injury.",
