    abstract "AIMS: Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disease without
 standard treatment. Salidroside (SAL) has various positive biological
 activities. In this study, experiments were performed to investigate whether
 SAL had protective effects on LPS-induced cell inflammatory injury. MAIN
 METHODS: The human thyroid follicular epithelial cells (Nthy-ori 3-1)
 stimulated by LPS were treated with SAL and/or transfected with miR-27a
 inhibitor. Cell viability and cell apoptosis were detect by Cell Counting
 Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of Cyclin D1 and
 apoptosis-related proteins, Notch proteins and NF-kappaB pathways related
 proteins were all measured by western blot. The expression of miR-27a and
 inflammatory chemokines MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha was examined by qRT-PCR.
 The protein weight of MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha was detected by ELISA. KEY
 FINDINGS: LPS treatment induced cell injury by decreasing cell viability, and
 inducing cell apoptosis and inflammatory chemokines MCP-1, IL-6 and
 TNF-alpha. In addition, SAL alleviated LPS-induced cell injury by increasing
 cell viability, and decreasing cell apoptosis and inflammatory chemokines
 MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. SAL upregulated miR-27a expression and further
 study showed that miR-27a downregulation impaired the protective effects of
 SAL. SAL downregulated the expression of Notch1/2, and phosphorylation of p65
 and IkappaBalpha. SIGNIFICANCE: SAL protects against LPS-induced injury in
 human thyroid follicular epithelial cells by upregulation of miR-27a. This
 process might be via inactivating Notch and NF-kappaB pathways.",
