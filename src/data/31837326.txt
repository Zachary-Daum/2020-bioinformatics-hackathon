    abstract "BACKGROUND: Notoginsenoside R1 (NG-R1) exhibits a
 pharmacological activity against excessive inflammation. Here, we aimed to
 ascertain the anti-inflammatory role of NG-R1 in ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
 as well as the possible mechanism which is still under to be elucidated.
 METHODS: In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was applied to evoke extreme
 inflammation in ATDC5 cells. To investigate the anti-inflammatory property of
 NG-R1, ATDC5 cells were exposed to NG-R1 prior to LPS stimulation.
 microRNA-301a (miR-301a)-overexpressed ATDC5 cells were established which
 confirmed by qRT-PCR. Then, inflammatory lesions were indicated by cell
 viability, apoptosis and inflammatory factors, including interleukin-1 beta
 (IL-1beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Nuclear
 factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway was determined by Western blotting assay.
 RESULTS: We found NG-R1 dramatically dampened the decrease of cell viability,
 facilitation of apoptosis and abundance of inflammatory factors induced by
 LPS. Additionally, NG-R1 pre-incubation impeded LPS-induced accumulation of
 miR-301a. However, the protective capacity of NG-R1 was impaired by miR-301a
 overexpression. Of note, LPS-caused phosphorylation of p65 and inhibitor of
 nuclear factor kappa-B alpha (IkappaBalpha) was repressed by NG-R1, while
 further enhanced in miR-301-transfected ATDC5 cells. CONCLUSION: NG-R1
 relived LPS-elicited inflammatory damages via blocking NF-kappaB in a
 miR-301a-silenced manner.",
