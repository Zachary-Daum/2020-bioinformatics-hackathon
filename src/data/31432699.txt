    abstract "Background: Many lncRNAs have been recognized as critical
 regulatory factors in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Herein, we further
 tested the influence of long non-coding RNA urothelial carcinoma associated 1
 (UCA1) on cardiomyocytes injury in AMI, along with the role of microRNA-122
 (miR-122) in this influence. Methods: Cardiomyocytes H9c2 was subjected to
 oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stimulation. Cell viability and apoptosis
 were assessed. The UCA1 and miR-122 expressions were measured by qRT-PCR.
 Plasmids and miRNAs transfection were utilized to elevate UCA1 and miR-122
 expressions. Subsequently, the influences of UCA1 and/or miR-122
 overexpression on OGD-aroused H9c2 cell viability inhibition and apoptosis
 were probed. The AKT/mTOR and JNK/p38MAPK pathways in cells were analyzed.
 Results: OGD aroused H9c2 cell injury by suppressing cell viability and
 elevating cell apoptosis. Followed by OGD stimulation, the UCA1 expression
 was lowered in H9c2 cells. Overexpression of UCA1 weakened H9c2 cell injury
 aroused by OGD and declined miR-122 expression. Moreover, miR-122 attended to
 the influence of UCA1 overexpression on OGD-aroused H9c2 cell injury.
 Overexpression of UCA1 weakened OGD-aroused AKT/mTOR pathway inactivation and
 JNK/p38MAPK pathway activation by declining miR-122. Conclusion:
 UCA1-relieved OGD-aroused H9c2 cell injury might be achieved via declining
 miR-122 and then promoting AKT/mTOR pathway and suppressing JNK/p38MAPK
 pathway.",
