    abstract "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies and a
 leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Accumulating evidence
 reported that microRNA (miR)-133a was involved in GC. This study aimed to
 investigate the function and mechanism of miR-133a in the development and
 progression of GC. The expression of miR-133a and presenilin 1 (PSEN1) in two
 GC cell lines, SGC-7901 and BGC-823, were inhibited and overexpressed by
 transient transfections. Thereafter, cell viability, migration, and apoptosis
 were measured by trypan blue exclusion assay, transwell migration assay, and
 flow cytometry assay, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was
 conducted to verify whether PSEN1 was a direct target of miR-133a.
 Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western
 blot analysis were mainly performed to assess the expression changes of
 epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins,
 apoptosis-related proteins, and Notch pathway proteins. MiR-133a inhibitor
 significantly increased cell viability and migration, while miR-133a mimic
 decreased cell viability, migration, and induced apoptosis. miR-133a
 suppression accelerated transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induce
 EMT, as evidenced by upregulation of E-cadherin, and downregulation of
 N-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug. Of contrast, miR-133a overexpression blocked
 TGF-beta1-induce EMT by altering these factors. PSEN1 was a direct target of
 miR-133a, and suppression of PSEN1 abolished the promoting functions of
 miR-133 suppression on cell growth and metastasis. Moreover, PSEN1 inhibition
 decreased Notch 1, Notch 2, and Notch 3 protein expressions. This study
 demonstrates an antigrowth and antimetastasis role of miR-133a in GC cells.
 Additionally, miR-133a acts as a tumor suppressor may be via targeting PSEN1.",
