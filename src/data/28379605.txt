    abstract "Osteosarcoma (OS) is a tumor with rapid progression, high
 metastatic potential and poor clinical prognosis. This study was aimed to
 investigate the function of miR-126 in OS cells. The miR-126 expression in OS
 cell lines and OS tissues were explored by qRT-PCR. Then, the effects of
 miR-126 on proliferation, cycle, migration, invasion, and transforming growth
 factor (TGF)-beta1 induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were
 assessed. Predicted by TargetScan, one of target genes for miR-126 was
 verified by luciferase activity assay. Meantime, the mRNA and protein
 expressions of ZEB1 were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot assay.
 Subsequently, the effect of ZEB1 silence on miR-126 down-regulated cells was
 also evaluated. Finally, the expressions of key kinases involved in c-Jun
 N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-1/signal transducer
 and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 pathways were detected by Western
 blot analysis. Result showed that miR-126 was down-regulated in OS tissues
 and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-126 significantly inhibited cell
 proliferation, migration, invasion, and TGF-beta1 induced EMT. The effect of
 miR-126 knockdown was just the opposite. ZEB1 was predicted and verified as a
 target gene of miR-126. Meantime, the influence of miR-126 knockdown was
 abrogated by ZEB1 silence. Additionally, the phosphorylation levels of c-Jun,
 JNK, JAK1, and STAT3 were down-regulated in miR-126 over-expressed cells, and
 the effect of miR-126 knockdown was reversed by ZEB1 silence. In conclusion,
 miR-126 inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in OS by
 targeting ZEB1 through inactivation of JNK and JAK1/STAT3 pathways. J. Cell.
