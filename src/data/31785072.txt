    abstract "In spite of a considerable breakthrough in antitumor effects of
 icariin (ICA), the studies regarding other functions of ICA still have not
 explored widely. This study aimed to report the function of ICA about the
 growth and migration of benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cell line
 (BPH-1) and human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1. Both BPH-1 and RWPE-1
 cells were treated with ICA for 12 hr. The cells proliferation, migration,
 apoptosis were tested by CCK-8 assay, transwell assay, flow cytometry, and
 western blot. The miR-7 expression was silenced by transfection in both BPH-1
 and RWPE-1 cells. The activation of PI3K/AKT and Raf1/ERK1/2 signaling
 pathways was detected by western blot. ICA inhibited both BPH-1 and RWPE-1
 cells proliferation, migration, and promoted apoptosis. Meanwhile, ICA
 promoted miR-7 expression. Other than this, the changes of cells
 proliferation inhibition, migration inhibition and apoptosis promotion in
 both BPH-1 and RWPE-1 cells induced by ICA were reversed partially or
 completely by transfecting specific miR-7 inhibitor. Apart from this, the
 activation of PI3K/AKT and Raf1/ERK1/2 signaling pathways was inhibited by
 ICA through upregulating miR-7 expression. The study released that ICA
 inhibited both BPH-1 and RWPE-1 cells proliferation, migration and promoted
 apoptosis by upregulating the levels of miR-7 expression, which was related
 to PI3K/AKT and Raf1/ERK1/2 signaling pathways.",
