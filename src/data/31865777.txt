    abstract "Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most
 prevailing primary brain tumours among adults and most aggressive cancers.
 Despite multiple developments in medical and surgical treatments, GBM is
 still a deadly disease with a high mortality rate. Here, this study was
 performed to investigate the function of circPVT1 on GBM.Methods: CCK-8 and
 flow cytometry were utilised to estimate viability and apoptosis in both
 cells. qRT-PCR was performed to determine circPVT1 and miR-199a-5p
 expression. Western blot was conducted to determine apoptosis, migration and
 EMT-related proteins levels when silencing circPVT1. Subsequently, these
 parameters were re-tested after up-regulating miR-199a-5p.Results: CircPVT1
 was highly expressed in GBM tissues. Silencing circPVT1 raised two cells
 apoptosis and reduced viability and migration capacity. Moreover, EGF-induced
 EMT was repressed by silencing circPVT1. In addition, miR-199a-5p expression
 was elevated when silencing circPVT1. And silencing circPVT1 exerted above
 changes via up-regulating miR-199a-5p. Finally, silencing circPVT1 repressed
 YAP1 and PI3K/AKT pathways via up-regulating miR-199a-5p.Conclusion: Our data
 suggested that silencing circPVT1 inhibited viability, migration, EGF-induced
 EMT and promoted apoptosis as well as repressed YAP1 and PI3K/AKT pathways by
 up-regulating miR-199a-5p.HIGHLIGHTSCircPVT1 expression is highly expressed
