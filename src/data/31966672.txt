    abstract "Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) are found in various human
 cancers, but the roles of miR-641 in lung cancer are still unclear. Our
 purpose is to explore miR-641 effects on the cellular behavior of A549 cells
 and the related molecular mechanisms. RT-qPCR assay was conducted to examine
 the expression of miR-641 in lung cancer and normal lung cell lines. A549
 cells were transfected with miR-641 mimic and inhibitor, programmed cell
 death 4 (PDCD4) targeted siRNA and corresponding controls. Then, cell
 viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis were analyzed by Cell Counting
 Kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell and flow cytometry assays. The expression of
 apoptosis-related factors and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related
 factors were detected by western blot and RT-qPCR. A target gene of miR-641
 was validated by dual-luciferase assay. Besides, the main factors expressions
 of JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT signal pathways were measured by western blot.
 Results showed that miR-641 was low expressed in A549, H1650 and H1299 cells
 compared to WI-38 and HEL-1 cells. MiR-641 overexpression inhibited cell
 viability, migration, invasion but promoted apoptosis and apoptosis-related
 factors levels. Moreover, miR-641 overexpression inhibited TGF-beta1-induced
 EMT in A549 cells. Additionally, PDCD4 was a direct target of miR-641 and
 PDCD4 silencing notably induced apoptosis, and relieved miR-641 suppressing
 promoted cell viability, migration and invasion. Finally, PDCD4 silencing
 blocked miR-641 suppression-induced activations of JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT
 signal pathways. In conclusion, miR-641 inhibited cell proliferation and
 metastasis but promoted apoptosis in lung cancer cells by targeting PDCD4 and
 blocking JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT signal pathways.",
