    abstract "Currently, multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to play
 vital roles in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. This study aimed to
 investigate the role of miR-21 in osteosarcoma. The level of miR-21 in 20
 pairs of osteosarcoma and corresponding adjacent tissues was monitored by
 qPCR. Human osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2 was transfected with either miR-21
 mimic or miR-21 inhibitor, and then cell viability, survival, and apoptosis
 were measured by MTT, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry. A target of
 miR-21 was predicted by the microRNA.org database and verified in vitro by
 using luciferase reporter, qPCR, and Western blot analyses. Finally, cells
 were cotransfected with siRNA against caspase 8 and miR-21 inhibitor, and the
 apoptotic cell rate was determined again. Results showed that the mRNA level
 of miR-21 was highly expressed in osteosarcoma tissues compared with adjacent
 tissues. Overexpression of miR-21 improved cell viability and survival but
 suppressed apoptosis. Caspase 8 was a direct target of miR-21, and it was
 negatively regulated by miR-21. Moreover, miR-21 suppression attenuated
 caspase 8 silencing and induced the decrease in apoptosis. In conclusion,
 overexpression of miR-21 suppressed SAOS-2 cell apoptosis via directly
 targeting caspase 8.",
