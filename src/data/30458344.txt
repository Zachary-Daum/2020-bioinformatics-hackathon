    abstract "BACKGROUND: Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) are major
 ingredients of fructus lycii, which have multiple pharmacological activities,
 such as antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities. This
 study attempted to reveal the potential of LBPs in hypoxia-injured H9c2 cells
 and the possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS: H9c2 cells were treated by
 300 mug/mL LBPs for 24 h upon hypoxia. Subsequently, the changes in cell
 viability, migration and apoptosis were evaluated. pre-miR-122 or miR-122
 sponge was transfected into H9c2 cells to investigate whether miR-122 was
 involved in the mechanisms of LBPs' action. Besides, an animal model of
 myocardial infarction (MI) was established, and the in vivo effects of LBPs
 were further investigated. RESULTS: LBPs increased cell viability,
 down-regulated p53, p21 and p16 protein expressions, improved migration, and
 repressed apoptosis in hypoxia-injured H9c2 cells. miR-122 was highly
 expressed in response to hypoxia, while was down-regulated by addition of
 LBPs. The protective actions of LBPs in hypoxia-injured H9c2 cells were
 attenuated by miR-122 overexpression, while were accelerated by miR-122
 suppression. Also, LBPs-induced the activation of MEK/ERK and AMPK signaling
 pathways were attenuated by miR-122 overexpression, and were accelerated by
 miR-122 suppression. in vivo investigation revealed that, MI rats
 administrated with LBPs decreased infarct size and improved cardiac function
 via down-regulation of miR-122. CONCLUSION: LBPs exhibited in vitro and in
 vivo cardioprotective activities via down-regulating miR-122. LBPs may have
 potential for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).",
