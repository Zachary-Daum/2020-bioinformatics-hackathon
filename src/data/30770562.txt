    abstract "BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma (UM) is an intraocular malignant
 tumor characterized by rapid progression and recurrence. The current
 conventional treatments are unsatisfactory. Histone acetylation at H3 lysine
 56 (H3K56ac) has been reported to be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer.
 However, whether H3K56ac prevents the occurrence and development of UM
 remains uninvestigated. The study aimed to explore the regulatory effect of
 H3K56ac on Ras-PI3K-AKT induced UM cells proliferation and migration.
 METHODS: The vectors of pEGFP-Ras(WT) , pEGFP-K-Ras (G12V/Y40C) , and
 pEGFP-N1 were transfected into MP46 cells, and protein levels of
 phosphorylated AKT (Ser473) and H3K56ac were examined using western blot
 analysis. The effect of H3K56ac on cell proliferation and migration were
 studied using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide,
 colony formation, and Transwell assays. Reverse transcription-quantitative
 polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
 were performed to determine the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B
 (PI3K/AKT) downstream genes. Further, the regulatory effects of silent mating
 type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1), general control
 nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), and mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) on
 Ras-PI3K-AKT affected H3K56ac expression were also investigated. RESULTS:
 H3K56ac expression was specifically downregulated by Ras-PI3K-AKT activation
 pathway. H3K56ac inhibited the tumorigenic effect of Ras-PI3K-AKT on MP46
 cells viability, colony formation, and migration, as well as participated in
 regulating the transcription of PI3K/AKT downstream genes. SIRT1 silence
 recovered H3K56ac expression, and reversed the tumorigenic effect of
 Ras-PI3K-AKT activation on MP46 cells. Downregulation of H3K56ac induced by
 Ras-PI3K-AKT activation was found to be associated with MDM2-mediated the
 degradation of GCN5. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that Ras-PI3K-AKT
 signaling promoted UM cells proliferation and migration via downregulation of
 H3K56ac expression, which might be related to MDM2-mediated the degradation
 of GCN5.",
