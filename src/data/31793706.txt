    abstract "Hypertension is recognized to be associated with low-grade
 inflammation. Baicalin (BAI) is reported to possess various pharmacological
 including anti-inflammatory activities. This research explored the molecular
 mechanism by which BAI functions in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs).
 HAECs were pretreated with BAI. Cell viability, apoptosis, and expressions of
 crucial proteins were respectively evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay,
 flow cytometry, and western blot. Productions of cytokines were respectively
 assessed employing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and
 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell transfection was utilized to alter
 miR-145 expression. The expressions of proteins participated in JNK and
 p38MAPK pathways were analyzed utilizing western blot. TNF-alpha inducement
 successfully evoked inflammatory injury in HAECs, exhibiting as prominently
 suppressed viability, while facilitated apoptosis and productions of
 cytokines. However, BAI pretreatment significantly ameliorated
 TNF-alpha-triggered inflammatory injuries. Besides, miR-145 expression was
 markedly inhibited by TNF-alpha inducement, while notably elevated by BAI
 pretreatment. Although miR-145 overexpression had no significant influence on
 apoptosis, miR-145 silence observably reversed BAI pretreatment-evoked
 protective influences on TNF-alpha-induced HAECs, as well as the inhibited
 impacts on the levels of key proteins involved in JNK and p38MAPK pathways.
 This investigation illustrated that BAI relieved TNF-alpha-triggered injuries
 through upregulating miR-145 via suppressing JNK and p38MAPK pathways.",
