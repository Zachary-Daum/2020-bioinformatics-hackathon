    abstract "BACKGROUND: Bronchopneumonia is a common lower respiratory tract
 inflammatory disease, which is one of main causes of death in infants and
 young children. Tanshinone IIA (Tan) is a naturally derived anti-inflammatory
 compound, which has been used for some inflammatory diseases. OBJECTIVE: Tan
 was expected to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory damage
 in human bronchial epithelium cell line BEAS-2B. METHODS: BEAS-2B cells were
 stimulated with LPS to mimic an in vitro model of bronchopneumonia. Cell
 viability and apoptosis were respectively assessed by CCK-8 assay and flow
 cytometry. The pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) were
 analyzed by qRT-PCR and quantified by ELISA. Relative miR-27a expression and
 Bcl-2 expression were detected by qRT-PCR. Cyclin D1 expression, Bcl-2
 expression, and main factors in PI3K/AKT and JNK signaling pathways were
 analyzed by Western blotting. Dual luciferase activity assay was conducted to
 analyze the target gene of miR-27a. RESULTS: Treatment of LPS inhibited cell
 viability, suppressed expression of Cyclin D1, promoted apoptosis, and
 enhanced secretions of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, whereas, all effects
 were reversed by Tan treatment. Moreover, miR-27a expression was decreased by
 Tan. Tan protected BEAS-2B cells by down-regulating miR-27a. Bcl-2 was a
 direct target of miR-27a and Bcl-2 overexpression attenuated the cell
 injury-promoting effect of miR-27a. PI3K/AKT and JNK signaling pathways were
 inhibited via action of Tan-miR-27a axis. CONCLUSION: Overall, Tan could
 protect BEAS-2B cells against LPS-induced inflammation damage via
 inactivating PI3K/AKT and JNK pathways by down-regulating miR-27a.",
