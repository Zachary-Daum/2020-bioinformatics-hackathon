    abstract "BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) threatens the
 health of middle-aged and older people with high recurrence rate and low
 survival rate. In this study, Neferin (Nef) was hoped to control growth and
 migration of GIST cell line GIST-T1. METHODS: Cell viability, proliferation,
 apoptosis, and migration were determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8)
 assay, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining
 method, and Transwell assay, respectively. The expression level of miR-449a
 was determined by qRT-PCR. Cell transfection was conducted to alter the
 expression level of miR-449a. Protein expression levels of key factors
 involved in cell cycle, cell apoptosis, cell migration, PI3K/AKT pathway and
 Notch pathways were analyzed by western boltting. RESULTS: Nef significantly
 inhibited GIST-T1 cell viability, proliferation, migration, but promoted cell
 apoptosis. The expression level of miR-449a was up-regulated in GIST-T1 cells
 after Nef treatment. Suppression of miR-449a reversed the Nef-induced GIST-T1
 cell proliferation and migration inhibition, as well as cell apoptosis.
 Importantly, Nef inactivated PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways in GIST-T1 cells by
 up-regulating miR-449a. Inhibitors of PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways notably
 reversed the effects of Nef + miR-449a inhibitor on GIST-T1 cell
 proliferation, apoptosis and migration. Besides, Nef also suppressed human
 gastric cancer SGC7901 cell migration and induced cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION:
 Nef suppressed growth and migration of GIST-T1 cells possibly via
 up-regulation of miR-449a and then inactivation of PI3K/AKT and Notch
 pathways.",
