    abstract "Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 2B (KDM2B) has been testified to
 be an oncogene in diverse cancers, which joins in mediating the
 carcinogenesis of cancers. Nonetheless, the function of KDM2B in colon cancer
 remains unexplored. The study attempted to disclose the influences of KDM2B
 acetylation in the progression of colon cancer. SW48 and SUN-C1 cells were
 transfected with Flag-KDM2B and administrated by trichostatin A and
 nicotinamide for 24 hr. Immunoprecipitation with a Flag antibody followed by
 western blot with acetyl-lysine-specific antibody was executed to detect
 KDM2B acetylation. The correlation between CREB binding protein (CBP) and
 KDM2B was then investigated. The K-R and K-Q mutants were constructed and the
 impacts of KDM2B on demethylation of nucleosomal substrates, p21, and puma
 transcription and the carcinogenesis of colon cancer were probed. CBP
 immediately evoked KDM2B acetylation at lysine residue 765 in colon cancer
 cells. Acetylation of KDM2B obviously destroyed the relevance with
 nucleosomes, demethylation of nucleosomal substrates, and repressed p21 and
 puma transcription. More important, KDM2B acetylation restrained SUN-C1 cells
 proliferation and colony formation, meanwhile, hindered cell migration and
 invasion. Beyond that, the tumor formation was repressed by KDM2B
 acetylation. The observations testified that CBP-triggered KDM2B acetylation
 accelerated the carcinogenesis of colon cancer.",
