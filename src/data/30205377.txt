    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recent studies have suggested that several
 lncRNAs contribute to the angiogenic function of endothelial cells. Herein,
 we set out to reveal whether lncRNA UCA1 has functions in endothelial
 angiogenesis. METHODS: The expression levels of lncRNA UCA1, miR-195 and
 CCND1 in human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells were altered by
 transfection. Subsequently, cell viability, migration, tube formation and
 apoptosis of HMEC-1 cells were respectively assessed. The cross-talk between
 lncRNA UCA1, miR-195, CCND1, and MEK/ERK and mTOR signaling pathways were
 investigated by performing qRT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: Silence of
 lncRNA UCA1 repressed HMEC-1 cells viability, migration, tube formation, and
 induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, silence of lncRNA UCA1 significantly
 up-regulated miR-195 expression. These alterations induced by lncRNA UCA1
 were further enhanced by miR-195 overexpression, while were attenuated by
 miR-195 suppression. Moreover, silence of lncRNA UCA1 deactivated MEK/ERK and
 mTOR signaling pathways via a miR-195-dependent regulation. And the
 deactivation of MEK/ERK and mTOR signaling pathways led to a down-regulation
 of CCND1. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that silence of lncRNA UCA1
 largely represses microvascular endothelial cells growth and tube formation.
 Silence of lncRNA UCA1 exerts its function possibly via up-regulation of
 miR-195, which in turn inactivates MEK/ERK and mTOR signaling pathways, and
 ultimately represses CCND1 expression.",
