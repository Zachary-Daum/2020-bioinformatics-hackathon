    abstract "The importance of microRNAs in regulating osteosarcoma
 development has been studied in recent years. However, the function of
 microRNA-451a in osteosarcoma growth is rarely investigated. Here, we
 explored the expression of microRNA-451a in osteosarcoma cell lines.
 Bioinformatic software, luciferase activity reporter assay, and Western blot
 were conducted to determine the association between microRNA-451a and
 tripartite motif-containing 66. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and transwell assay
 were used to explore the regulatory effects of microRNA-451a on osteosarcoma
 cells. Moreover, we explored whether microRNA-451a modulates osteosarcoma
 cell biological activity by regulating tripartite motif-containing 66. The
 expression of microRNA-451a was found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma and
 negatively regulated the expression of tripartite motif-containing 66.
 Tripartite motif-containing 66 was further validated as a target of
 microRNA-451a. MicroRNA-451a inhibits the growth and invasion of osteosarcoma
 cell lines through targeting tripartite motif-containing 66. The miR-451a
 targets tripartite motif-containing 66 may provide novel therapeutic targets
 for the treatment of osteosarcoma.",
