    abstract "Ras-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2
 (ERK1/2) signaling has been proposed as the crucial regulators in the
 development of various cancers. Histone acetylation at H3 lysine 14 (H3K14ac)
 is closely associated with gene expression and DNA damage. However, whether
 H3K14ac participates in mediating Ras-ERK1/2-induced cell proliferation and
 migration in uveal melanoma cells remains unknown. The purpose of this study
 is to investigate the effect of H3K14ac on Ras-ERK1/2 affected uveal melanoma
 cell phenotypes. MP65 cells were transfected with Ras (WT) and Ras
 (G12V/T35S) , the unloaded plasmid of pEGFP-N1 served as a negative control.
 Protein levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Thr202) and H3K14ac were assessed by
 western blot assay. Cell viability, number of colonies, migration, and the
 downstream genes of ERK1/2 were analyzed by
 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide, soft-agar
 colony formation, transwell, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. HA-tag
 vectors of CLR3 and TIP60 and the small interfering RNAs that specific for
 CLR3 and MDM2 were transfected into MP65 cells to uncover the effects of
 CLR3, TIP60, and MDM2 on Ras-ERK1/2 mediated H3K14ac expression and MP65 cell
 phenotypes. We found that, Ras-ERK1/2 decreased H3K14ac expression in MP65
 cells, and H3K14ac significantly suppressed Ras-ERK1/2-induced cell
 viability, colony formation, and migration in MP65 cells. Moreover, the
 transcription of CYR61, IGFBP3, WNT16B, NT5E, GDF15, and CARD16 was regulated
 by H3K14ac. Additionally, CLR3 silence recovered H3K14ac expression and
 reversed the effect of Ras-ERK1/2 on MP65 cell proliferation, migration and
 the mRNAs of ERK1/2 downstream genes. Besides, Ras-ERK1/2 decreased H3K14ac
 expression by MDM2-mediated TIP60 degradation. In conclusion, Ras-ERK1/2
 promoted uveal melanoma cells growth and migration by downregulating H3K14ac
 via MDM2-mediated TIP60 degradation.",
