    abstract "Colorectal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers.
 Recently, several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been characterized as oncogenes or
 tumor suppressors in colorectal cancer. This study was aimed to explore the
 tumor suppressive effects and its underling mechanism of miR-335 on
 colorectal cancer cells. Human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells were employed
 and the expression of miR-335 in cells was altered by transfection with
 miR-335 mimic and miR-335 inhibitor. Thereafter, CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry,
 Transwell assay and Western blotting were used to detect cell viability,
 apoptosis, migration, invasion, and the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal
 transition (EMT)-related proteins. Dual luciferase activity assay was
 performed to test whether Twist1 was a direct target of miR-335. Moreover,
 cells were co-transfected with miR-335 inhibitor and Twist1 siRNA, and then
 cell growth and metastasis were re-evaluated. miR-335 overexpression
 inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptotic
 cells rate. miR-335 overexpression up-regulated E-Cadherin, while
 down-regulated N-Cadherin, Vimentin and Snail. Twist1 was a direct target of
 miR-335, and Twist1 silence promoted apoptosis, and abolished miR-335
 suppression induced increases in cell viability, migration, invasion, and
 abnormal expressions of EMT-related proteins. Besides, Twist1 silence
 abolished miR-335 suppression induced activations of p65 and IkappaBalpha,
 and miR-335 suppression induced up-regulations of Wnt3a, Wnt5a and
 beta-Catenin. miR-335 inhibited HCT116 cells growth, migration, invasion, and
 ETM process. miR-335 exhibited tumor suppressive effects possibly by
 inhibition of Twsit1 and thus inactivating NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin
 pathways.",
