    abstract "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to involve in variety of
 biological progresses. The present study aimed to explore the functional
 roles of miR-29b in endothelial cells inflammatory damage, as well as the
 underlying mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce
 endothelial cell inflammation, and the role of miR-29b in endothelial cells
 inflammatory damage was detected by testing cell viability, cell apoptosis,
 and the expression of inflammation factors after the suppression or
 overexpression of miR-29b. Aiming to make clear of the underlying mechanism
 of miR-29b regulation in inflammation, we studied the relationship between
 miR-29b and NF-kappaB/JNK pathway in HUVEC and Eahy926 cells. The results
 showed that LPS significantly suppressed cell viability, promoted apoptosis
 and increased TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha and INF-gamma secretions. MiR-29b was
 up-regulated in LPS-treated HUVEC and Eahy926 cells. Moreover, suppression of
 miR-29b alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury by promoting cell
 viability, decreasing apoptosis and reducing the secretions of TNF-alpha,
 IL-1alpha and INF-gamma in both HUVEC and Eahy926 cells. On the contrary,
 overexpression of miR-29b aggravated cell inflammatory injury in both HUVEC
 and Eahy926 cells. Furthermore, LPS activated NF-kappaB and JNK signal
 pathways. However, suppression of miR-29b reduced LPS-activated NF-kappaB and
 JNK pathways in both HUVEC and Eahy926 cells. Taken together, these findings
 concluded that miR-29b could regulate LPS-induced endothelial cells
 inflammatory injury through regulation of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling
 pathways.",
