    abstract "Aims: To explore the roles and regulatory mechanisms of the
 circular RNA (circRNA)-hsa-circ-0072309 in CAKI-1 and ACHN cells. Methods:
 CAKI-1 and ACHN cells were transfected with hsa-circ-0072309 overproduction
 vector (circRNA) and microRNA-100 (miR-100) mimic or the corresponding
 controls. Cell viability was detected with the CCK-8. The protein expression
 levels of p53, c-Myc, cleaved-caspase-3/9, matrix metalloproteinase
 (MMP)-2/9, vimentin, AKT, PI3K and mTOR were individually determined through
 western blot. qRT-PCR was used to examine the expressions of hsa-circ-0072309
 and miR-100. The apoptotic rate and the migration or invasion rates were
 separately determined by the annexin v-FITC/PI with a flow cytometer and
 modified two-chamber migration assay or millicell hanging cell culture.
 Results: The hsa-circ-0072309 was poorly expressed in tumor tissue. Abundant
 hsa-circ-0072309 induced the inhibitions of cell proliferation, migration and
 invasion, as well as the PI3K/AKT and the mTOR cascades but enhancement of
 apoptosis. circRNA stimulated the down-regulation of miR-100, which was
 low-expressed in tumour tissue and whose overproduction abolished the impacts
 of circRNA on these elements mentioned above. Conclusion: The
 hsa-circ-0072309 played anti-tumour roles by targeting miR-100 by blocking
 the PI3K/AKT and mTOR cascades in the CAKI-1 and ACHN cell lines.",
