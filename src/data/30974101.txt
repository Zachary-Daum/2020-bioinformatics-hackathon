    abstract "Sevoflurane is a commonly used anesthetic in cancer surgery.
 However, little information is available about the effects of sevoflurane on
 the osteosarcoma cells. The present study explored the effects of sevoflurane
 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, as well
 as the underlying mechanism. Human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS and Saos-2
 were pretreated with different concentrations (2.5%, 5%, or 10%) or different
 times (0, 2, 4 or 6h) of sevoflurane. Cell viability, proliferation,
 migration, invasion and apoptosis were analyzed by MTT assay, Ki67 staining,
 colony formation assay, wound healing scratch assay, transwell assays and
 Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Expression of key factors related to
 proliferation, migration, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
 process and PI3K/AKT pathway were evaluated by western blotting. We found
 that sevoflurane significantly inhibited U2OS and Saos-2 cell viability,
 proliferation, migration and invasion, but induced cell apoptosis. Moreover,
 sevoflurane obviously inactivated PI3K/AKT pathway in U2OS and Saos-2 cells.
 Activator of PI3K/AKT pathway, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) notably
 weakened the effects of sevoflurane on U2OS and Saos-2 cell proliferation,
 migration and apoptosis. Besides, sevoflurane suppressed EMT process in U2OS
 and Saos-2 cells. To sum up, our results evidenced that sevoflurane exerted
 anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects on osteosarcoma cells by
 inactivating PI3K/AKT pathway.",
