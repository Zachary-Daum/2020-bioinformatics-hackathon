    abstract "Objectives: Osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by degradation of
 articular cartilage, is a leading cause of disability. As the only cell type
 present in cartilage, chondrocytes play curial roles in the progression of
 OA. In our study, we aimed to explore the roles of miR-23b in the
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury. Materials and Methods:
 LPS-induced cell injury of ATDC5 cells was evaluated by the loss of cell
 viability, enhancement of cell apoptosis, alteration of apoptosis-associated
 proteins, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Then, miR-23b level after
 LPS treatment was assessed by qRT-PCR. Next, the effects of aberrantly
 expressed miR-23b on the LPS-induced inflammatory injury were explored. The
 possible target genes of miR-23b were virtually screened by informatics and
 verified by luciferase assay. Subsequently, whether miR-23b functioned
 through regulating the target gene was validated. The involved signaling
 pathways were investigated finally. Results: Cell viability was decreased but
 cell apoptosis, as well as release of inflammatory cytokines, was enhanced by
 LPS treatment. MiR-23b was down-regulated by LPS and its overexpression
 alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury. PDCD4, negatively regulated by
 miR-23b expression, was verified as a target gene of miR-23b. Following
 experiments showed miR-23b alleviated LPS-induced cell injury through
 down-regulating PDCD4 expression. Phosphorylated levels of key kinases in the
 NF-kappaB pathway, as well as expressions of key kinases in the Notch
 pathways, were increased by PDCD4 overexpression. Conclusion: MiR-23b was
 down-regulated after LPS treatment, and its overexpression ameliorated
 LPS-induced inflammatory injury in ATDC5 cells by targeting PDCD4, which
 could activate the NF-kappaB/Notch pathways.",
