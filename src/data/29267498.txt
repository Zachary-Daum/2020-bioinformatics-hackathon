    abstract "Ginsenoside Rg1, one of the most notable active components of
 Panax ginseng, has been widely reported to exert anti-inflammatory actions.
 This study aimed to reveal whether ginsenoside Rg1 also exhibits beneficial
 roles against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis and inflammation in
 human renal tubular epithelial cells, and to evaluate the potential role of
 the component on tubulointerstitial nephritis treatment. HK-2 cells were
 treated with various doses of ginsenoside Rg1 (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 muM)
 in the absence or presence of 5 mug/mL LPS. Thereafter, CCK-8 assay, flow
 cytometry, western blot, migration assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
 assay, and ELISA were carried out to respectively assess cell viability,
 apoptosis, migration, ROS activity, and the release of inflammatory
 cytokines. As a result, ginsenoside Rg1 protected HK-2 cells from LPS-induced
 injury, as cell viability was increased, cell apoptosis was decreased, and
 the release of MCP-1, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha was reduced. Ginsenoside
 Rg1 functioned to HK-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the 150 muM dose
 exhibited the most protective functions. Ginsenoside Rg1 had no significant
 impact on cell migration and ROS activity, while it alleviated LPS-induced
 ROS release and migration impairment. Furthermore, the down-regulations of
 p-PI3K, p-AKT, and up-regulations of PTEN, p-IkappaBalpha, p-p65, Bcl-3
 induced by LPS were recovered to some extent after ginsenoside Rg1 treatment.
 In conclusion, ginsenoside Rg1 protects HK-2 cells against LPS-induced
 inflammation and apoptosis via activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and
 suppression of NF-kappaB pathway.",
