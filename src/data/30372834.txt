    abstract "BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a damage of spinal cord
 that caused by trauma or diseases. Angelica Polysaccharide (AP) is one of the
 most major active components isolated from the root of Angelica sinensis
 (Oliv.) Diels. This study aimed to investigate the effects of AP on
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced SCI cell injury model (PC-12 cell injury
 model). METHODS: Cell viability was detected using cell counting kit-8
 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed using Guava Nexin assay. qRT-PCR
 was conducted to measure the expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta),
 IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and microRNA-223 (miR-223).
 Cell transfection was performed to up-regulate the expression of miR-223.
 Finally, protein expression levels of key factors involved in cell apoptosis,
 inflammatory reaction and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) pathway were
 evaluated using western blotting. RESULTS: We found that AP pre-treatment or
 post-treatment both significantly alleviated LPS-induced PC-12 cell viability
 inhibition, apoptosis and the elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines.
 Mechanistically, we revealed that AP pre-treatment attenuated LPS-induced
 miR-223 expression level increase in PC-12 cells. Overexpression of miR-223
 reversed the protective effects of AP pre-treatment on LPS-treated PC-12
 cells. Furthermore, we pointed out that AP pre-treatment inactivated
 NF-kappaB pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells by down-regulating miR-223.
 CONCLUSION: AP protected PC-12 cells from LPS-induced inflammatory injury at
 least partially by down-regulating miR-223 and then inactivating NF-kappaB
 pathway. This study provides evidence for further understanding the
 anti-inflammatory effects of AP and offers theoretical basis for deeply
 exploring the prevention and treatment of SCI by using AP.",
