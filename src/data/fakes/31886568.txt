    abstract "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) culminates the cancer
 process. Studies found circular RNA-SMAD2 (circSMAD2) impedes EMT by
 regulating microRNA (miR). Here, we intended to investigate the role of
 circSMAD2-miR-9 node in prostate cancer cells. Tissue specimens were procured
 from 20 patients with prostate cancer. LNCaP and PC-3 cells were transfected
 with the plasmid bearing circSMAD2 or miR-9 mimic. circSMAD2 and miR-9 were
 quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
 The cells were subjected to assays for viability, proliferation, and
 migration. EMT process was evaluated by investigating the phosphorylation of
 SMAD2, alteration of cadherin switch, and accumulation of vimentin. STAT and
 MEK/ERK pathways were then determined by Western blot. We found that the
 tumor tissues showed a decrement in circSMAD2. Restoration of circSMAD2
 inhibited the proliferative and migratory activities, and impaired EMT
 process of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Moreover, circSMAD2-overexpressed cells
 showed a decrease in miR-9. Upregulating miR-9 abolished the inhibitory role
 of circSMAD2 in proliferation, migration, and EMT. Furthermore, circSMAD2
 abated the phosphorylation of STAT3, MEK, and ERK, while miR-9 mimic
 rehabilitated the phosphorylated expression. In conclusion, miR-9 inhibition
 is required for circSMAD2 to abate migration and EMT process in prostate
 cancer cells.",
