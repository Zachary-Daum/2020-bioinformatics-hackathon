    abstract "BACKGROUND: Cardiac hypertrophy related factor (CHRF), a newly
 recognized long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is a central regulator in cardiac
 hypertrophy responses. This study attempted to show the potential role of
 lncRNA CHRF in bacterial infection caused myocarditis. METHODS: H9c2 cells
 were transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for lncRNA
 CHRF alone or in combination with miR-221 inhibitor, and then subjected to
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The following parameters were measured: cell
 viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation,
 pro-inflammatory cytokines release, microRNA (miR)-221 expression and the
 activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase
 (JNK) pathways. RESULTS: Silence of lncRNA CHRF impeded the LPS injury to
 H9c2 cells, as cell viability was increased (p<.05), apoptosis was inhibited
 (p<.05), ROS generation was decreased (p<.01), and the expression of
 interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was suppressed
 (p<.05). However, silence of lncRNA CHRF had no impacts on normal H9c2 cells
 growth (p>.05). miR-221 was negatively regulated by lncRNA CHRF (p<.01).
 LncRNA CHRF silence did not protect H9c2 cells against LPS when miR-221 was
 suppressed (p<.05 or p<.01). Also, the inhibitory effects of lncRNA CHRF
 silence on the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK pathways were flattened by
 miR-221 suppression (p<.05 or p<.01). CONCLUSION: These in vitro data
 collectively demonstrated that lncRNA CHRF silence protected H9c2 cells
 against LPS-induced injury via up-regulating miR-221 and modulating NF-kappaB
 and JNK pathways.",
