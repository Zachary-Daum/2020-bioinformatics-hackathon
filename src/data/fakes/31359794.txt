    abstract "Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) possesses a cardioprotective effect via
 mediating microRNAs (miRs), while it is unexplored whether miR-210 is
 regulated by Rb1 in response to oxidative stress. Human endothelial EA.hy926
 cells were stimulated with H2O2 before Rb1 treatment. After transfection,
 cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion assays were conducted.
 Western blot was applied to quantify protein. BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa
 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and miR-210 were analyzed with quantitative
 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Dual luciferase activity
 assay was performed. Rb1 elevated viability, migration, and invasion of
 H2O2-treated cells. H2O2-induced apoptosis was moderated by Rb1. miR-210 was
 augmented in H2O2-treated cells after Rb1 stimulation. miR-210 inhibitor
 abolished the positive effects of Rb1. BNIP3 was negatively modulated by
 miR-210 and implicated in modulating viability, apoptosis, and migration and
 invasion. In addition, BNIP3 modulated phosphorylation of regulators. Rb1
 repressed oxidative injury via elevating miR-210. miR-210 negatively mediated
 BNIP3, which participated in oxidative damage via regulating mammalian
 targets of rapamycin (mTOR) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB).",
