    abstract "Objectives: Pioglitazone, an anti-diabetic agent, has been
 widely used to treat type II diabetes. However, the effect of pioglitazone on
 myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) is still unclear. Herein, the
 objective of this study is to learn about the regulation and mechanism of
 pioglitazone effects on oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced myocardial
 cell injury. Materials and Methods: A cellular injury model of OGD-treated
 H9c2 cells in vitro was constructed to simulate ischemic/reperfusion (I/R)
 injury. Then, various concentrations of pioglitazone (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10
 muM) were used for the treatment of H9c2 cells, and CCK-8, flow cytometry and
 western blot assays were performed to examine cell viability, apoptosis, and
 the protein levels of factors involved in cell cycle and apoptosis in
 OGD-treated cells. MiR-454 inhibitor was used to suppress miR-454 expression,
 and whether miR-454 was involved in regulating OGD-induced cell injury was
 studied. Two key signal pathways were examined to uncover the underlying
 mechanism. Results: OGD reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in
 H9c2 cells (P<0.05, P<0.01 or P< 0.001). OGD-induced injury was significantly
 attenuated by pioglitazone at the concentration of 5 muM. Additionally,
 pioglitazone significantly up-regulated miR-454 expression in OGD-injured
 cells (P< 0.05 or P< 0.01). MiR-454 suppression declined the protective
 effect of pioglitazone on OGD-injured H9c2 cells (P<0.05 or P< 0.01).
 Besides, pioglitazone activated PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK pathways via
 up-regulating miR-454. Conclusion: Pioglitazone protected H9c2 cells against
 OGD-induced injury through up-regulating miR-454, indicating a novel
 therapeutic strategy for treatment of MIRI.",
