    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading
 cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In our study, we aimed to
 investigate the effects of alkannin on HCC cells growth, migration and
 invasion. METHODS: Huh7 and Hep3B2.1-7 cells were treated with alkannin.
 Expression of miR-92a in cell was altered by transfection with miR-92a-mimic
 (miR-92a-M) or miR-92a-inhibitor (miR-92a-I). Cell viability, proliferation,
 apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8, BrdU
 assay, flow cytometry, and transwell assay, respectively. The expression of
 miR-92a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of
 proteins associated with proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis was measured
 by Western blot. RESULTS: Alkannin decreased cell viability and
 proliferation, executed cell apoptosis, and inhibited the migration and
 invasion of Huh7 and Hep3B2.1-7 cells. Alkannin negatively regulated the
 expression of miR-92a, and transfection with miR-92a-M impeded alkannin's
 anti-tumor functions. PTEN and TP53INP1 were found to be target genes of
 miR-92a. Alkannin inhibited PTEN-dependent PI3K/AKT pathway. Furthermore, the
 biological effects of miR-92a-I in alkannin treated cells were eliminated by
 PTEN silencing. CONCLUSION: Alkannin exerted anti-tumor activities by
 downregulation of miR-92a. This process might be executed by inactivating
 PTEN/PI3K/AKT signal pathways through the binding effects of miR-92a on PTEN.",
