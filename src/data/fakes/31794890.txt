    abstract "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious complication of diabetes,
 which is the main cause of blindness among adults. Traditional Chinese
 medicines (TCMs) have been proven to delay the development of DR.
 Nonetheless, the effect of Schizandrin A (SchA) on DR remains uninvestigated.
 The present study aimed to probe the protective effect of SchA on
 high-glucose (HG)-induced injury in ARPE-19 cells. We observed that SchA
 accelerated cell proliferation, prohibited apoptosis, and restrained
 pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1],
 interleukin-6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) and
 reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in HG-stimulated cells. Additionally,
 miR-145 expression was upregulated in HG and SchA co-treated cells, and
 miR-145 inhibition reversed the protective effect of SchA on HG-managed
 ARPE-19 cells. Interestingly, downregulated myeloid differentiation factor 88
 (MyD88) was found in HG and SchA co-treated cells, and upregulation of MyD88
 was observed in miR-145 inhibitor-transfected cells. Additionally, SchA
 hindered nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein
 kinase (p38MAPK) signaling pathways in HG-treated ARPE-19 cells. The findings
 validated that SchA could protect ARPE-19 cells from HG-induced cell injury
 by regulation of miR-145.",
