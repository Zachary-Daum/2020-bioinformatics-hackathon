    abstract "Glioma is a common primary brain tumor with high mortality rate
 and poor prognosis. Long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is
 a tumor suppressor in diverse cancer types. However, the role of MEG3 in
 glioma remains unclear. We aimed to explore the effects of MEG3 on U251 cells
 as well as the underlying mechanisms. U251 cells were stably transfected with
 different recombined plasmids to overexpress or silence MEG3. Effects of
 aberrantly expressed MEG3 on cell viability, migration, apoptosis,
 expressions of apoptosis-associated and autophagy-associated proteins, and
 phosphorylated levels of key kinases in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were all
 evaluated. Then, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of Sirt7 in
 cells abnormally expressing MEG3 were estimated. In addition, effects of
 abnormally expressed MEG3 and Sirt7 on U251 cells were determined to reveal
 the underlying mechanism of MEG3-associated modulation. Cell viability and
 migration were significantly reduced by MEG3 overexpression whereas cell
 apoptosis as well as Bax and cleaved caspase-3/-9 proteins were obviously
 induced. Beclin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I were upregulated and p62 was downregulated
 in MEG3 overexpressed cells. In addition, the autophagy pharmacological
 inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) affected the effect of MEG3 overexpression
 on cell proliferation. Furthermore, the phosphorylated levels of key kinases
 in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were all reduced by MEG3 overexpression. Sirt7
 was positively regulated by MEG3 expression, and effects of MEG3
 overexpression on U251 cells were ameliorated by Sirt7 silence. MEG3
 suppressed cell proliferation and migration but promoted autophagy in U251
 cells through positively regulating Sirt7, involving in the inhibition of the
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",
