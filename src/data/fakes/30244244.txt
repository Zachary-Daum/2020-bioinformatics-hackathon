    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ligustrazine (LSZ) has been identified as an
 antitumor agent against some types of cancers. Nevertheless, its ability to
 inhibit growth, migration and invasion of medulloblastoma cells is still
 unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect of LSZ on Daoy cells.
 METHODS: The effects of LSZ on viability, proliferation, apoptosis,
 migration, and invasion of Daoy cells were analyzed by CCK-8, BrdU, flow
 cytometry and Transwell assays, respectively. The effect of LSZ on miR-211
 expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. miR-211 inhibitor transfection was
 performed to suppress miR-211 expression. The effects of LSZ on
 apoptosis-related factors, MMP-2, MMP-9, and Vimentin (Vim), as well as main
 factors of PI3K/AKT and mTOR pathways were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS:
 LSZ inhibited viability but promoted apoptosis of Daoy cells. Additionally,
 the proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of Daoy cells were
 decreased by LSZ. Meanwhile, LSZ promoted the activations of Caspase-3 and
 Caspase-9, increased Bax level, decreased Bcl-2 level, as well as inhibited
 the expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9 and Vim. Additionally, we found that LSZ
 enhanced miR-211 expression and exerted its anti-medulloblastoma effect by
 up-regulation of miR-211. Furthermore, LSZ inhibited PI3K/AKT and mTOR
 signaling pathways by up-regulating miR-211. CONCLUSION: LSZ suppressed
 medulloblastoma Daoy cells by up-regulating miR-211 and further modulating
 the activations of PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling pathways.",
