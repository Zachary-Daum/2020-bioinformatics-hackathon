    abstract "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related
 neurodegenerative disease resulted from the progressive degeneration of
 dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta region of substantia nigra. The
 goal of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of long
 noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HAGLROS on the apoptosis and autophagy in PD. The
 MPTP-induced PD mouse model and MPP(+)-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cell model were
 established, and the expression levels of HAGLROS and miR-100 were
 determined. Subsequently, the effects of suppression of HAGLROS on apoptosis
 and autophagy in MPTP-induced PD mouse model and in MPP(+)-intoxicated
 SH-SY5Y cells were investigated. In addition, the association between HAGLROS
 and miR-100 as well as HAGLROS and activation of phosphoinositide-3
 kinase/protein kinase-B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway
 in MPP(+)-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells was explored. HAGLROS was increasingly
 expressed in MPTP-induced PD mouse model and MPP(+)-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells
 and suppression of HAGLRO decreased apoptosis and autophagy in both in vivo
 and in vitro PD models. Further in vitro studies showed that HAGLRO
 negatively regulated miR-100 expression, and HAGLROS regulated apoptosis and
 autophagy of MPP(+)-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells through sponging miR-100.
 Moreover, ATG10 was identified as a target of miR-100. Besides, suppression
 of HAGLROS alleviated MPP(+)-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cell injury by activating
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Our findings reveal that upregulation of HAGLROS may
 contribute to the development of PD via inhibiting apoptosis and autophagy,
 which may be achieved by regulating miR-100/ATG10 axis and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
 pathway activation.",
