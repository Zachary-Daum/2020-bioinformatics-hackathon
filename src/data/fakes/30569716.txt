    abstract "This study establishes that BCAR4 has pro-proliferative effects
 on normal thyroid cells. BCAR4 up-regulation promotes proliferation and
 suppresses apoptosis of NTHY-ORI 3-1 cells and human primary thyrocytes, and
 EGFR is highly expressed in BCAR4 over-expressing-cells. In contrast, BCAR4
 up-regulation did not modulate cell viability or cell cycle progression when
 EGFR was knocked-down. Further, the phosphorylated forms of PI3K, AKT, mTOR
 and p70S6K were up-regulated by BCAR4 up-regulation, and the alteration in
 these kinases induced by BCAR4 up-regulation was abolished when EGFR was
 knocked-down. This study therefore revealed the pro-proliferative role of
 lncRNA BCAR4 in NTHY-ORI 3-1 cells and human primary thyrocytes; where BCAR4
 accelerated thyroid cells proliferation by EGFR up-regulation and the
 modulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. These findings indicate that targeting
 BCAR4 has potential in hyperthyroidism treatment.",
