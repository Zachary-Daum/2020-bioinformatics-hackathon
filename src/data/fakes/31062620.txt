    abstract "This study aimed to investigate the potential effect of
 Scutellaria barbata D. Don (SBD) on oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion
 (OGD/R)-injured PC12 cells. PC12 cells were pretreated with various
 concentrations of 0.1-0.8 mg/ml SBD for indicated times (12-48 h) and then
 subjected to OGD/R injury. Cell viability, apoptosis and proliferation were
 detected using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Ki67 staining and western blot.
 Oxidative damage was assessed by detecting MDA content, SOD activity and GSH
 levels. The mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) was measured by
 Rh123 staining. Western blot was performed to assess the expression levels of
 Nrf2 and PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins. We found that SBD pretreatment
 promoted cell viability and proliferation but inhibited apoptosis of
 OGD/R-injured PC12 cells in dosage- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, SBD
 attenuated oxidative damage and restored mitochondria dysfunction, as
 evidenced by the reduced MDA content, the increased SOD and GSH levels, and
 the increased Deltapsim. Furthermore, SBD induced the expression of Nrf2 in a
 PI3K/AKT-dependent signalling. Knockdown of Nrf2 blocked the protective
 effects of SBD on PC12 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SBD
 pretreatment protects PC12 cells against OGD/R-induced injury. The potential
 mechanism may be through up-regulating the expression of Nrf2 in a
 PI3K/AKT-dependent pathway.",
