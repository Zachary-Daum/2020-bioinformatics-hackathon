    abstract "Baicalin (BAI), one major flavonoid from Scutellaria
 baicalensis, possesses anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. However,
 the effect of BAI on diabetes mellitus has not been investigated. This study
 explored the antidiabetic effect of BAI on pancreatic beta-cell line Min6.
 Min6 cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) to mimic
 beta-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes mellitus. The effects of BAI on
 viability and apoptosis of Min6 cells were analyzed by the cell counting
 kit-8 assay and Annexin V-fluoresceine isothiocyanate/propidium iodide
 staining method. The insulin secretion of Min6 cells was determined using
 radioimmunoassay. Expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and inducible
 nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3
'-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and nuclear factor KappaB (NF-kappaB)
 pathways were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Relative microRNA-205
 (miR-205) expression was determined by quantitative real time polymerase
 chain reaction. TNF-alpha treatment inhibited cell growth and insulin
 secretion, but promoted iNOS expression. All of these effects were reversed
 by BAI treatment. BAI promoted viability; suppressed apoptosis; regulated
 caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2 and Bcl-2-associated X protein; decreased iNOS
 level; and increased insulin production. BAI protected Min6 cells by
 upregulating miR-205. Besides, the Min6 cell-protective effect of BAI was
 PI3K/AKT pathway and NF-kappaB pathway dependent. BAI activated the PI3K/AKT
 pathway and inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway by regulating miR-205. In
 conclusion, BAI protected Min6 cells from TNF-alpha-induced injury by
 upregulating miR-205, which acts, at least in part, via activation of the
 PI3K/AKT pathway and inactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway.",
