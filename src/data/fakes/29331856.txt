    abstract "Nowadays 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy is
 widely used for treating colon carcinoma. However, 5-FU resistance in the
 treatment of colon carcinoma has become more common and thereby new
 therapeutic strategies and new adjuvant drugs still need to be explored. Two
 5-FU-resistant colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and SW480, were used to
 investigate the effects of Schizandrin A (SchA), 5-FU, or their combination
 on cell viability and apoptosis. Besides, the role of miR-195 was studied to
 further clarify the specific function of SchA. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry
 analysis were conducted to determine cell viability and apoptosis,
 respectively. miR-195 expression was determined by quantitative real-time
 PCR. Cell apoptosis-related proteins and factors of PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB
 pathways were analyzed by Western blot. Cell viability assay showed that SchA
 treatment at non-toxic dosages caused a marked enhancement of 5-FU-induced
 cytotoxicity. Moreover, we explored that miR-195 was up-regulated by SchA;
 and overexpression of miR-195 reduced cell viability and sensitized
 5-FU-resistant HCT116 and SW480 cells to 5-FU. The promoting effect of SchA
 on 5-FU susceptibility can be partly abolished by miR-195 knockdown. Thus it
 was speculated that SchA might enhance cell chemosensitivity to 5-FU by
 up-regulating miR-195. Finally, we found that PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways
 were inhibited by high expression of miR-195 reduced by SchA. Our results
 suggested that SchA sensitized 5-FU-resistant colon carcinoma cells to 5-FU
 by up-regulating miR-195. SchA combined with 5-FU could be a promising
 strategy for the adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer.",
