    abstract "BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot is a severe complication of diabetes
 mellitus, mainly caused by diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The objective of
 this study was to investigate the function of emodin (a neuroprotective agent
 reported previously) in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: A
 neuron-like cell line PC-12 was subjected with high level glucose, before
 which emodin was applied to treat cells. The expression of miR-9 in cell was
 overexpressed or suppressed by miRNA transfection. Thereafter, cell
 viability, apoptosis and autophagy were assessed, respectively. RESULTS: High
 glucose exhibited cytotoxicity in PC-12cells. Emodin protected PC-12cells
 against high glucose-induced apoptosis and viability impairment. These
 observations were coupled with the down-regulations of p21, p16, Bax, cleaved
 caspase-3 and -9, and the up-regulations of CyclinD1 and Bcl-2. Additionally,
 high glucose-induced autophagy was alleviated by emodin, as Beclin-1 was
 down-regulated, p62 was up-regulated, and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II
 was decreased. miR-9 was highly expressed in response to emodin treatment.
 More interestingly, the protective actions of emodin on high glucose-induced
 injury were reversed by miR-9 suppression. Also, the activation of PI3K/AKT
 signaling and deactivation of NF-kappaB signaling induced by emodin were
 recovered by miR-9 suppression. CONCLUSION: Emodin protected PC-12cells
 against high glucose-induced apoptosis and autophagy. The neuroprotective
 activities might be realized by up-regulation of miR-9, and modulation of
 PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB signaling pathways.",
