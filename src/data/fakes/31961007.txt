    abstract "Craniocerebral trauma is a serious disease accompanied with
 mechanical damage, oxidative damage, and neuronal apoptosis. Circular RNA
 HIPK3 (circHIPK3), an abundant circRNA, exerts the function in promoting cell
 growth. Therefore, we aimed to explore the biological roles and mechanism of
 circHIPK3 on cell damage in craniocerebral trauma. PC-12 cells were
 cotransfected with PLCDH-cirHIPK3 and microRNA-455 (miR-455) inhibitor and
 then were treated with H2 O2 for 24 hours. Cell viability, apoptosis and mean
 fluorescence intensity (MFI) were tested through trypan blue staining, flow
 cytometry and reactive oxygen species assay, respectively. Expression of
 circHIPK3 and miR-455 were tested through quantitative reverse transcription
 polymerase chain reaction. Expression of pro-PARP, cleaved-PARP,
 pro-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-9,
 beta-actin, beclin-1, p62, light chain 3-I (LC3-I), LC3-II, nuclear factor
 erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), t-extracellular-regulated kinase (t-ERK)
 and p-ERK were tested via Western blot experiments. The 100 muM H2 O2
 -induced cell damage presented as reducing cell viability, increasing
 apoptosis, autophagy, and MFI. Besides, H2 O2 could downregulate circHIPK3.
 However, overexpression of circHIPK3 attenuated cell damage caused by H2 O2
 that it increased cell viability, decreased apoptosis, autophagy and MFI
 through upregulating miR-455. Additionally, circHIPK3 overexpression promoted
 the activation of Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulating miR-455. Our
 study demonstrated that circHIPK3 attenuated H2 O2 -induced cell damage and
 activated Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulation of miR-455.",
