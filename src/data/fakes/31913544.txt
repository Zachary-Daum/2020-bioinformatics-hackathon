    abstract "BACKGROUND: Propofol, a kind of intravenous sedative drug, is
 certified that exerts anti-inflammation and antitumor functions. However, the
 influence of propofol in cerebral injury and the corresponding mechanism
 remains unexplained, that our article focuses on. METHODS: PC12 cells were
 treated with propofol and exposed in glutamic acid (Glu) solutions. Cell
 viability, apoptotic potential, apoptosis-related and autophagy-linked
 proteins were tested via CCK-8, flow cytometry, and western blot assays.
 Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to test miR-19a
 expression in Glu-stimulated cells. Next, miR-19a mimic transfection was used
 to assess the effects of miR-19a on cell apoptosis and autophagy in Glu or
 propofol treated cells. Finally, western blot was performed to test AMPK and
 mTOR pathways. RESULTS: Glu exposure promoted cell apoptosis and autophagy of
 PC12 cells, while propofol attenuated cell apoptosis and autophagy triggered
 by Glu. Additionally, propofol decreased the miR-19a expression in
 Glu-stimulated PC12 cells. Meanwhile, over-expression of miR-19a reversed the
 effects of propofol on Glu-induced cell apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover,
 propofol potentiated AMPK and mTOR pathways in Glu-stimulated PC12 cells via
 impeding miR-19a expression. CONCLUSIONS: These finding revealed that
 propofol relieved Glu-triggered apoptosis and autophagy of PC12, and
 activated AMPK and mTOR pathways by suppressing miR-19a expression.",
