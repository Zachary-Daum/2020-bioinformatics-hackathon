    abstract "This study aimed to investigate the role and the possible
 mechanism of the long noncoding small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) in
 bladder cancer development. The expression of SNHG16 in the tumor tissues and
 plasma of patients with bladder cancer as well as bladder cancer cell lines
 was detected. T24 cells were then transfected with sh-SNHG16 to further
 investigate the effects of suppression of SNHG16 on T24 cell proliferation,
 apoptosis, migration, and invasion. In addition, the regulatory relationships
 between SNHG16 and miR-98 as well as the target of miR-98 were explored.
 Besides, the association between SNHG16 and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was
 further elucidated. The SNHG16 expression was upregulated in the tumor
 tissues and plasma of patients with bladder cancer, as well as bladder cancer
 cells. Suppression of SNHG16 inhibited T24 cell proliferation, promoted
 apoptosis, and suppressed migration and invasion in vitro. In addition,
 SNHG16 negatively regulated miR-98 expression and regulated the malignant
 behaviors of T24 cells through sponging miR-98. Moreover, signal transducer
 and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was identified as a functional
 target of miR-98, and miR-98 regulated the malignant behaviors of bladder
 cancer cells by targeting STAT3. Besides, suppression of SNHG16 inhibited the
 activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which was further regulated by
 miR-98 and STAT3, indicating that the effects of SNHG16/miR-98/STAT3 on T24
 cells were achieved through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Our findings reveal
 that long noncoding RNAs SNHG16 is upregulated in bladder cancer and
 contributes to the development of bladder cancer possibly via regulating the
 miR-98/STAT3/Wnt/beta-catenin pathway axis. The
 SNHG16/miR-98/STAT3/Wnt/beta-catenin pathway axis may provide a new strategy
 for bladder cancer treatment.",
