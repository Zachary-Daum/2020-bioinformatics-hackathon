    abstract "Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is a
 condition causing apnea and hypopnea. LncRNA-ROR revealed properties in
 regulating hypoxia response. Our study explored the roles of ROR in
 CoCl2-induced hypoxia injury in HK-2 cells. HK-2 cells were treated with
 CoCl2 to induce hypoxia injury. Cell viability, cell apoptosis and apoptotic
 proteins were detected using CCK-8, flow cytometry and western blot,
 respectively. The alter expression of ROR and miR-145 was achieved through
 transfection. Moreover, the expressions of HIF-alpha and ERK and MAPK related
 factors were examined using western blot. We found that CoCl2 decreased cell
 viability and increased apoptosis as well as increased the expression of ROR.
 ROR overexpression increased cell viability, decreased cell apoptosis. ROR
 overexpression upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and decreased p53,
 Bax and cleaved-Caspase-3. ROR overexpression also increased the expression
 of HIF-alpha. On the opposite, ROR silence led to the opposite results as
 relative to ROR overexpression. ROR overexpression decreased expression of
 miR-145. Co-transfection with ROR overexpression and miR-145 impaired the
 promoting effects of ROR in CoCl2 treated cells. ROR increased
 phosphorylation of ERK while decreased phosphorylation of MAPK. In
 conclusion, lncRNA ROR alleviated CoCl2-induced hypoxia injury through
 regulation of miR-145 as well as modulating ERK and MAPK signalling.
 Highlights CoCl2 induces ROR upregulation; Overexpression of ROR reduces
 CoCl2-induced HK-2 cell injury; Silence of ROR promotes CoCl2-induced HK-2
 cell injury; Overexpression of ROR decreases miR-145 expression; ROR
 overexpression modulates ERK and MAPK signalling pathways through regulation
 of miR-145.",
