    abstract "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the potential roles and
 mechanism of miR-1247 in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced acute pneumonia.
 MATERIALS AND METHODS: The miR-1247 expression in acute stage patients with
 infantile pneumonia was detected. To establish the cell model of acute
 pneumonia, A549 cells were treated with 1mg/mL lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The
 effects of miR-1247 dysregulation on the cell viability, apoptosis,
 inflammation and autophagy of LPS-induced A549 cells were investigated.
 Moreover, the functional targets of miR-1247 were identified and the
 regulatory relationships between miR-1247 and JNK or NF-kappaB pathways were
 explored. RESULTS: The miR-1247 was lowly expressed in acute phage patients
 with infantile pneumonia. In addition, LPS treatment significantly inhibited
 A549cell viability, induced apoptosis, promoted the production of cytokines
 and decreased autophagy, thus causing A549 cell injury. Moreover, miR-1247
 was decreased expression after LPS treatment, and overexpression of miR-1247
 alleviated LPS-induced A549 cell injury. Furthermore, CC chemokine ligand
 (CCL) 16 was a functional target gene of miR-1247. Knockdown of CCL16
 alleviated LPS-induced cell injury, and the combination of miR-1247
 inhibition and CCL16 knockdown reversed the effects of CCL16 knockdown alone
 on LPS-induced A549 cell injury. Besides, inhibition of miR-1247 activated
 JNK and NF-kappaB pathways, while knockdown of CCL16 inhibited the activation
 of these pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveals that miR-1247 is lowly
 expressed in acute stage patients with infantile pneumonia. Overexpression of
 miR-1247 may alleviate LPS-induced A549 cell injury through targeting CCL16.
 JNK and NF-kappaB pathways may be key mechanisms to regulate the role of
 miR-1247 in LPS-induced lung injury.",
