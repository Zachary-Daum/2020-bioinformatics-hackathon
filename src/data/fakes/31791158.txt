    abstract "Background: Quercetin belongs to the flavonoids family, which
 has been proven to have extensive pharmacological effects. Nevertheless, the
 function of quercetin in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has not yet been
 reported. In the research, we purposed to disclose the effectiveness of
 quercetin in the pathogenesis of PAD.Methods: HMEC-1 cells were cultivated in
 Matrigel for 24 h to observe the tube-formation. Detections of cell
 viability, migration and apoptosis were through implementing CCK-8, Transwell
 and flow cytometry methods. Western blot was utilised for measuring
 angiogenesis-, migration- and apoptosis-correlative factors. MiR-216a
 expression was examined via qRT-PCR, and its functions in HMEC-1 cells were
 uncovered after miR-216a mimic transfection. Assessment of JAK2/STAT3 and
 PI3K/AKT pathways was via implementing western blot.Results: HMEC-1 cells
 were spontaneously vascularised under Matrigel condition. Quercetin
 predominantly repressed cell viability, migration, VEGF expression and
 facilitated apoptosis in HMEC-1 cells. Additionally, suppression of miR-216a
 was discovered in HMEC-1 cells after quercetin stimulation, meanwhile
 miR-216a overexpression annulled the functions of quercetin in HMEC-1 cells.
 Besides, quercetin deactivated PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways through
 adjusting miR-216a.Conclusion: The above-mentioned consequences exhibited
 that quercetin suppressed HMEC-1 cell viability, migration and tube-formation
 through hindering JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT pathway via declination of miR-216a.",
