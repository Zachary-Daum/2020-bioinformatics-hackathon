    abstract "Adriamycin (ADR) is an anti-cancer drug which offers improvement
 in survival for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, the drug
 resistance is almost inevitable. Increasing evidences suggested that
 microRNAs (miRNAs) were associated with cancer chemo-resistance. Here, we
 aimed to explore the possible mechanism of miR-103 affected resistance to ADR
 in AML cells. Different concentrations of ADR were used to induce K562 and
 KASUMI-1 cells, and miR-103 mimic, inhibitor were transfected into K562 and
 KASUMI-1 cells. Cell viability and proliferation were determined by trypan
 blue staining and MTT assays for evaluating K562 and KASUMI-1 cells drug
 resistance. The relationship of miR-103 and COP1, Trib1, and C/EBPalpha were
 analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Cell proliferation, viability were
 detected again. Besides, the expressions of main factors of cell cycle and
 PI3K/AKT signal pathway were analyzed by Western blot. Results showed that
 ADR inhibited cell viability and proliferation in K562 and KASUMI-1 cells.
 However, K562 and KASUMI-1 cells appeared drug resistance for 50 passages at
 0.8 microM of ADR. In addition, miR-103 expression was up-regulated in
 ADR-resistant K562 cells (K562/ADR) and overexpression of miR-103 increased
 K562 cells drug resistance via promoting cell viability and cell
 cycle-related factors expressions. COP1 was positively regulated by miR-103,
 suppression of miR-103 recovered K562/ADR cells drug resistance by regulation
 of COP1, Trib1, and C/EBPalpha. Besides, miR-103 blocked PI3K/AKT signal
 pathway by regulation of COP1. These data indicated that miR-103 was
 up-regulated in drug resistant cells and it may regulate ADR-resistance by
 regulation of COP1 in AML cells.",
