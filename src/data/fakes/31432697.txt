    abstract "Salidroside is an active ingredient extracted from Rhodiola
 rosea that has anti-tumor activities. The current paper attempted to assess
 the impact of Salidroside on gastric cancer (GC) and explore the potential
 mechanism. GC cell lines (SNU-216 and MGC803) and gastric epithelial cell
 line GES-1 were treated with Salidroside. CCK-8 assay, colony formation
 assay, flow cytometry and Transwell assay were respectively performed to
 evaluate GC cells phenotype. qRT-PCR and western blot were conducted to
 reveal the downstream genes and signaling of Salidroside. We found that 800
 muM Salidroside was capable of reducing GC cells viability, while has no such
 impacts on GES-1 cells. Salidroside inhibited GC cells proliferation,
 migration, invasion and promoted apoptosis, which coupled with the
 down-regulation of p21, Bcl-2, MMP2, RhoA, p-ROCK1, Vimentin and the
 up-regulations of CyclinD1, Bax, cleaved caspases. miR-99a was found to be
 highly expressed in response to Salidroside treatment. Besides, the
 inhibition of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling induced by Salidroside was
 attenuated by miR-99a silence and in this process, IGF1R worked as a target
 of miR-99a. The anti-GC effect of Salidroside was also confirmed in a mouse
 model of GC. The promoting effect of Salidroside on miR-99a expression was
 also verified in vivo. Furthermore, Salidroside promoted the
 cisplatin-sensitivity of SGC7901/DDP cells. In conclusion, this study
 demonstrated that Salidroside possessed anti-GC effects through regulating
 miR-99a/IGF1R axis and inhibiting MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways.",
