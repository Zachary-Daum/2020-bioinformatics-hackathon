    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Schizandrin A (SchA) exerts anticancer potential.
 However, the effects of SchA on thyroid cancer (TC) have not been clear
 illuminated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of SchA on TC cell line
 TPC-1 and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: TPC-1 cells were treated with
 SchA and/or transfected with miR-429 mimic, anti-miR-429 and their
 corresponding negative controls (NC). Cell viability, proliferation,
 migration, invasion and cell apoptosis were examined by CCK-8 assay,
 bromodeoxyuridine, modified two-chamber migration assay, Millicell Hanging
 Cell Culture and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The expression of
 miR-429, p16, Cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinases 4 (CDK4), matrix
 metalloprotein (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and Vimentin was detected by qRT-PCR. All
 protein expression was examined by western blot. RESULTS: SchA inhibited cell
 proliferation, metastasis and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, SchA
 negatively regulated miR-429 expression. Treatment with miR-429 mimic and
 SchA reversed the results led by SchA and NC. Furthermore, the
 phosphorylation beta-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and
 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were statistically down-regulated
 by SchA while co-treatment with miR-429 mimic and SchA led to the opposite
 trend. Moreover, miR-429 knockdown showed contrary results. CONCLUSION: SchA
 inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion and inactivates
 Wnt/beta-catenin and MEK/ERK signaling pathways by down regulating miR-429.",
