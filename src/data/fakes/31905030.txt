    abstract "Background: CircZNF609 (cZNF609) is previously revealed as an
 essential mediator in oxidative stress. This paper determined the role of
 cZNF609 in skin oxidative damage to evaluate its importance in pressure
 ulcer.Methods: HaCaT cells treated by H2O2 were considered as a cell model of
 pressure ulcer. The role of cZNF609 in the model was checked by conducting
 CCK-8 assay, FITC-PI double-staining, ROS detection and Western blot. The
 downstream gene and signalling of cZNF609 were studied by utilizing qRT-PCR
 and Western blot.Results: HaCaT cells were remarkably damaged by H2O2, as
 evidenced by the viability loss, apoptosis and ROS generation. It was coupled
 with the elevated expression of p53, p16, Bax and the activated forms of
 caspase-3 and PARP. Meanwhile, cZNF609 was high-expressed in response to
 H2O2. The oxidative stress driven by H2O2 was alleviated by transfection with
 cZNF609 specific siRNA. Further, the anti-antioxidant impacts of cZNF609
 silence were impeded by miR-145 silence. The inhibition of JNK and p38MAPK
 pathways induced by cZNF609 silence was impeded by miR-145
 silence.Conclusion: The protective function of cZNF609 silence in
 H2O2-injured HaCaT cells was revealed in vitro. Silence of cZNF609 exhibited
 its impact possibly through regulating miR-145, and JNK and p38MAPK pathways.",
