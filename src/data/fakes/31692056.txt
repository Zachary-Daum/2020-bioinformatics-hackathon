    abstract "We explored the roles and regulatory mechanisms of the circular
 RNA (circRNA) nuclear receptor-interacting protein 1 (NRIP1; circNRIP1) in
 ACHN and CAKI-1 cells. ACHN and CAKI-1 cells were transfected with
 small-interfering-circNRIP1 (si-circNRIP1) and microRNA-505 (miR-505)
 inhibitor or the corresponding controls. Cell viability was detected with the
 Cell Counting Kit-8. The protein expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax,
 cleaved-caspase-3, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, adenosine 5
'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase B (AKT),
 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and mammalian target of rapamycin
 (mTOR) were individually determined via Western blot. Quantitative reverse
 transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the expressions
 of circNRIP1 and miR-505 both in tumor cells and tissues. The apoptotic rate,
 the colony numbers, and the migration rate were separately determined by the
 Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide and flow cytometer,
 colony formation assay, and migration assay. We found that circNRIP1 was
 overexpressed in tumor tissue but miR-505 was overproduced. Silencing
 circZNF292 induced inhibition of cell viability, colony formation, and
 migration, as well as the activity of AMPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascades but
 enhancement of apoptosis. si-circNRIP1 stimulated the upregulation of
 miR-505, whose silence abolished the effects of si-circNRIP1 on these
 elements mentioned above. In conclusion, the circNRIP1 played oncogenic roles
 in the ACHN and the CAKI-1 cell lines by targeting miR-505 via stimulating
 AMPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascades.",
