    abstract "BACKGROUND: Optic nerve injury is a severe complication of
 traumatic brain injury, which may lead to permanent and potentially loss of
 vision. Arbutin (ARB) is a natural hydroquinone glycoside, has been widely
 utilized to treat pigmented disorders. However, the role of ARB in optic
 nerve injury is still unclear. The study attempted to explore the effect of
 ARB on H2O2-induced oxidative injury in RGCs. METHODS: RGCs were treated with
 different concentrations of H2O2 to construct a cell oxidative injury model.
 Subsequently, the effects of ARB on these injured cells were examined through
 testing cell viability, apoptosis and their associated factors. MicroRNA-29a
 (miR-29a) inhibitor was transfected into RGCs, and the regulatory effect of
 miR-29a inhibition on H2O2-injured cells was detected. Further, the important
 signaling pathways of MEK/ERK and p38MAPK were determined to uncover the
 underlying mechanism. RESULTS: We firstly used H2O2 to induce RGCs injury,
 and subsequent experiments found that ARB significantly alleviated
 H2O2-induced cell injury in RGCs by promoting cell viability, reducing
 apoptosis, and regulating the protein levels of cell growth-associated
 factors. Increasing expression of miR-29a was observed in ARB and H2O2
 treated cells. Moreover, miR-29a inhibition significantly abrogated the
 protective effect of ARB on H2O2-injured RGCs. NRAS was predicated as a
 direct target gene of miR-29a. Mechanistically, ARB blocked MEK/ERK and
 p38MAPK pathways by up-regulating miR-29a. CONCLUSIONS: These data
 demonstrated that ARB protected RGCs against oxidative injury induced by H2O2
 through blocking MEK/ERK and p38MAPK signaling pathways by up-regulation of
 miR-29a.",
