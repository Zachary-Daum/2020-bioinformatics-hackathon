    abstract "The comprehensive pathological peculiarities of Neferine (NEF)
 have been testified in disparate diseases. But, the functions of NEF in
 choriocarcinoma progression remain unexplored. The research endeavoured to
 uncover the anti-tumour action of NEF in choriocarcinoma cells. NEF at
 diverse doses was employed to dispose JEG-3 and HTR-8 cells, and cell
 viability assessment adopted CCK-8 assay. After 60 mug/mL NEF management,
 BrdU-positive cells, apoptosis, migration, invasion and correlative factors
 were assessed. CHRF expression in choriocarcinoma tumour and choriocarcinoma
 cell lines was estimated via RT-qPCR. Then, the functions of overexpressed
 CHRF in NEF-disposed cells were determined. At last, impacts of NEF on
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways were evaluated. Results showed that NEF
 restrained cell proliferation, triggered apoptosis and repressed migration
 and invasion in JEG-3 and HTR-8 cells. CHRF was ascended in choriocarcinoma
 tissues and NEF repressed CHRF expression in choriocarcinoma cell lines.
 Additionally, overexpressed CHRF abolished the above functions of NEF in
 choriocarcinoma cells proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion.
 Further, NEF impeded PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways via repressing CHRF.
 The explorations testified that NEF exhibited the anti-tumour action in JEG-3
 and HTR-8 cells via hindering PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways by mediating
 CHRF.",
