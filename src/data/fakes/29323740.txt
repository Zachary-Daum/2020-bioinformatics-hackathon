    abstract "Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children
 and adolescents with high rate of incidence, high frequency of recurrence,
 and high degree of metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of
 long noncoding RNA antisense ncRNA in the abundant in neuroepithelium area
 (ANA)/B-cell translocation gene 3 (BTG3) locus (lncRNA ASBEL) on the
 pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. The expression levels of ASBEL in human
 osteoblast cells and human osteosarcoma cells were evaluated using qRT-PCR.
 Effects of ASBEL knockdown on cell viability, migration, and invasion were
 detected using trypan blue exclusion assay, cell migration, and cell invasion
 assay, respectively. The regulatory effects of ASBEL on microRNA-21 (miR-21)
 were analyzed using qRT-PCR. The roles of miR-21 and protein phosphatase 2A
 (PP2A), the possible downstream factor of miR-21, in osteosarcoma cell
 proliferation, migration, and invasion were also explored. The results showed
 that ASBEL was highly expressed in osteosarcoma cells. Knockdown of ASBEL
 inhibited osteosarcoma cell viability, migration, and invasion, as well as
 the expression level of miR-21. PP2A was a direct target of miR-21, which
 participated in the effects of ASBEL and miR-21 on the activation of
 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase 3/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta
 (PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
 regulated protein kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathways as well as the
 enhancement of osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In
 conclusion, we verified that ASBEL-miR-21-PP2A pathway might play critical
 regulatory effects on the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma and could be as the
 potential therapeutic target and biomarker for osteosarcoma treatment.",
