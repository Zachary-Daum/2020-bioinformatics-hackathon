    abstract "It is of significance to alleviate oxidative damages for the
 treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). Studies have ascertained that green
 tea polyphenols (GTPs) exert protective activities against oxidative damages.
 In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of GTP against
 H2O2-caused injuries in PC12 cells as well as the molecular underpinnings
 associated with long non-coding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma
 transcript 1 (MALAT1). PC12 cells were preincubated with GTP prior to H2O2
 stimulation. Furthermore, MALAT1-deficient PC12 cells were constructed by
 transfection and identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
 reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Next, viability and apoptosis were detected by cell
 counting kit-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. Meanwhile, Western blot
 assay was carried out to monitor the expression alteration of proteins
 associated with apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax, pro-Caspase-3/9, and cleaved
 Caspase-3/9) and autophagy (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3
 (LC3)-II, LC3-I, Beclin-1, and p62). Moreover, we examined the expression of
 beta-catenin and dissected the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3
'-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT). We found that H2O2 decreased the
 viability of PC12 cells while initiated apoptosis and autophagy processes.
 GTP-preincubated PC12 cells maintained the viability and resisted the
 apoptosis and autophagy induced by H2O2. Pointedly, GTP-pretreated PC12 cells
 showed an increase in MALAT1 after H2O2 stimulation. Of note, the protective
 effects of GTP were buffered in MALAT1-deficient cells in response to H2O2.
 The expression of beta-catenin and phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT were
 upregulated by GTP, while MALAT1 knockdown led to opposite results. To sum
 up, GTP protected PC12 cells from H2O2-induced damages by the upregulation of
 MALAT1. This process might be through activating Wnt/beta-catenin and
 PI3K/AKT signal pathways.",
