    abstract "Colorectal carcinoma is a common malignant tumor occurring in
 the alimentary system. Despite developments of modern medicine, developed
 resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) may lead to poor prognosis. Herein, we
 aimed to explore the effects of beta-elemene on colorectal carcinoma cells
 (HCT116 and HT29) as well as the underlying mechanisms. Beta-elemene reduced
 cell viability and induced apoptosis in HCT116 and HT29 cells. Increased
 apoptosis following beta-elemene exposure was due to enhanced sensitivity to
 5-FU through down-regulating miR-191. Expression of key kinases, including
 Wnt3a, and beta-catenin, were down-regulated by beta-elemene through a
 miR-191 mechanism. Moreover, beta-elemene might improve resistance of
 colorectal carcinoma cells to 5-FU by down-regulating miR-191, thereby
 inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.",
