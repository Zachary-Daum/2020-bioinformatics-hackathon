    abstract "AIMS: Salidroside is a major functional component of Rhodiola
 rosea L. with a lot of pharmacological effects, including anti-tumor. The
 present work aimed to explore whether Salidroside could also exhibit
 anti-tumor functions in Wilms' tumor. MAIN METHODS: WIT49 and RM1 cells were
 treated by various doses of Salidroside. CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry
 detection, colony formation assay, Transwell assay, RT-qPCR and Western blot
 analysis were conducted to measure WIT49 and RM1 cells proliferation,
 apoptosis, migration and invasion. The expression changes of miR-891b in
 response to Salidroside treatment were tested by RT-qPCR. Rescue assays were
 performed to test whether miR-891b was a downstream effector of Salidroside.
 Finally, the involvement of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and NF-kappaB signaling pathways
 was studied. KEY FINDINGS: Salidroside with concentration of 80muM
 significantly reduced WIT49 and RM1 cells viability, survival capacity,
 migration and invasion, and significantly induced apoptosis. Meanwhile,
 down-regulation of Cyclin D1, MMP-2 and Vimentin, up-regulations of p53 and
 p21, as well as cleavage of caspase-3 and -9 were observed in
 Salidroside-treated cell. miR-891b was down-regulated by Salidroside. And
 Salidroside did not suppress WIT49 and RM1 cells growth, migration and
 invasion when miR-891b was overexpressed. Also, the deactivation of
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR and NF-kappaB pathways induced by Salidroside was reversed by
 miR-891b overexpression. SIGNIFICANCE: Salidroside inhibits Wilms' tumor
 cells growth, migration and invasion via down-regulating miR-891b, which
 leads to the deactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and NF-kappaB signaling pathways.",
