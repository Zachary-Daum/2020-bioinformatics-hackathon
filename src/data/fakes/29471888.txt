    abstract "Inhibition of tumor metastasis is one of the most important
 purposes in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. This study aimed to explore
 the effects of liquiritigenin, a flavonoid extracted from the roots of
 Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch, on HCT116 cell proliferation, invasion, and
 epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that liquiritigenin
 significantly inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation, invasion, and the EMT
 process, but had no influence on cell apoptosis. Moreover, liquiritigenin
 remarkably reduced the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2
 (Runx2) in HCT116 cells. Overexpression of Runx2 obviously reversed the
 liquiritigenin-induced invasion and EMT inhibition. Furthermore,
 liquiritigenin inactivated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B
 (PI3K/AKT) pathway in HCT116 cells. Upregulation of Runx2 reversed the
 liquiritigenin-induced PI3K/AKT pathway inactivation. In conclusion, our
 research verified that liquiritigenin exerted significant inhibitory effects
 on CRC invasion and EMT process by downregulating the expression of Runx2 and
 inactivating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Liquiritigenin could be an
 effective therapeutic and preventative medicine for CRC treatment.",
