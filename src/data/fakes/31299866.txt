    abstract "We planned to dig the carcinostasis activity of physcion
 8-O-beta-glucopyranoside (PG) in ovarian cancer cells and explored whether
 long non-coding RNA NORAD was the potential cause of the carcinostasis impact
 of PG. The impacts of PG on the tumour cell behaviours (including cell
 viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion) of SKOV3 cells were grabbed.
 The levels of NORAD in cancer tissues and cell lines were determined;
 afterwards, the impacts of abnormal expression of NORAD on the tumour cell
 behaviours of SKOV3 cells were assessed. Moreover, we explored whether NORAD
 modulated the level of STAT3 by competitively sponging miR-608, thus
 mediating the antineoplastic effects of PG on ovarian cancer cells. PG
 suppressed cell viability, enhanced apoptosis and lessened migration and
 invasion of SKOV3 cells. NORAD was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and
 cells. Silencing of NORAD lessened cell viability, migration and invasion,
 but induced apoptosis of SKOV3 cells, whereas overexpression of NORAD had
 opposite effects. Moreover, PG decreased the expression of NORAD.
 Overexpression of NORAD reversed the effects of PG treatment on the cell
 biological performances of SKOV3 cells, which were further reversed after
 overexpression of miR-608 simultaneously. Furthermore, STAT3 was tested as a
 target gene of miR-608, and the impact of NORAD in PG-treated SKOV3 cells
 were through the miR-608-mediated STAT3. Our findings reveal that
 NORAD/miR-608/STAT3 axis is pivotal in mediating the antineoplastic impacts
 of PG on ovarian cancer cells, which may offer a novel explanation in the
 therapy of ovarian cancer.",
