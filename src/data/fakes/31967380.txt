    abstract "Alkannin displays tumor suppressive activity by initiating
 apoptosis. Here, we corroborated its role in pancreatic carcinoma (PANC-1)
 cells and addressed the molecular mechanism in which microRNA-199a (miR-199a)
 and Klotho might be implicated. PANC-1 and MIN6 cells were treated by
 alkannin and its role was evaluated in cellular viability. Next we assessed
 the ability of PANC-1 cells to proliferate, migrate, and invade as well as
 apoptosis process. Besides, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),
 CyclinD1, p53, and caspases were quantified using Western blot. miR-199a was
 detected by qRT-PCR. miR-199a-silenced or -replenished cells were established
 to study its function role in Klotho in conjunction with alkannin. Further,
 Klotho-overexpressed or -silenced cells were constructed to investigate the
 alteration of mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways. Alkannin repressed the viability of
 PANC-1 cells instead of MIN6 cells. Alkannin counteracted the growth of
 PANC-1 cells through inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion and
 facilitating apoptosis, which was evidenced by the modulation on PCNA,
 CyclinD1, p53, and cleavage of caspases. The silence of miR-199a by alkannin
 was also involved in the antitumor process. Alkannin enhanced Klotho
 expression possibly through silencing miR-199a. Besides, mTOR and MEK/ERK
 signaling were counteracted by Klotho overexpression while facilitated by its
 silence. Alkannin inhibited the growth of PANC-1 cells via modulating
 miR-199a-Klotho node. During this process, mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways were
 blunted.",
