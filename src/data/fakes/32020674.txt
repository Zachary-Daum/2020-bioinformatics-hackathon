    abstract "BACKGROUND: CircMAN2B2 is a newly discovered circRNA that has
 been found to be an oncogene in lung cancer and glioma. The present study was
 designed to reveal the role of circMAN2B2 in gastric carcinoma (GC). METHODS:
 qRT-PCR method was utilized to examine circMAN2B2 expression in GC tissues
 and paracancerous tissues. Next, circMAN2B2 expression in SNU-16 and AGS
 cells was silenced by transfection. CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow
 cytometer, Transwell assay, and Western blot were conducted for testing cell
 phenotype changes. Further, the downstream genes and signaling were uncovered
 by qRT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: As relative to paracancerous tissues,
 circMAN2B2 was high-expressed in GC tissues. Silence of circMAN2B2 clearly
 declined SNU-16 and AGS cells viability, survival, migration but enhanced
 apoptosis. Meanwhile, silence of circMAN2B2 induced the cleavage of caspases
 (-3 and -9), down-regulation of MMPs (-2 and -9), and up-regulation of
 miR-145. The impacts of circMAN2B2 silence toward SNU-16 and AGS cells were
 attenuated by miR-145 silence. Moreover, circMAN2B2 silence deactivated PI3K,
 AKT while activated JNK through regulating miR-145. CONCLUSION: This work
 presented the oncogenic function of circMAN2B2 in GC cells growth and
 migration. CircMAN2B2 exerted its function possibly through regulating
 miR-145 as well as PI3K/AKT and JNK pathways.",
