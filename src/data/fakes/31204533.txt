    abstract "Burn injury is a gigantic challenge in public health which
 brings multiple negative effects to patients both in physical and spiritual
 aspects. Inflammation plays vital roles in the progression of burn injury,
 and our study investigated whether notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) alleviated
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human keratinocyte HaCaT cell inflammatory
 injury. Inflammatory injury was induced by LPS in HaCaT cells. Stimulated
 cells were then treated by NGR1 in different concentrations. Cell viability
 and cell apoptosis were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry,
 respectively. The concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)
 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
 (ELISA). The accumulated levels of apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3 and
 caspase-9), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), p38 mitogen-activated protein
 kinase (p38MAPK) signal pathways-related proteins (p65, IkappaBalpha, and
 p38MAPK), and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) were
 examined by western blot. Transfection was used to alter the expression of
 MyD88. We found that LPS stimulated HaCaT cells and induced cell
 inflammation, evidenced by decreasing cell viability, increasing cell
 apoptosis, and elevating TNF-alpha and IL-6 expressions. Then, we found that
 NGR1 reversed the results by enhancing cell viability, inhibiting cell
 apoptosis, and reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6 expressions. In addition, NGR1
 decreased the phosphorylation of p65, IkappaBalpha, and p38MAPK, which
 increased by LPS. Moreover, NGR1 negatively regulated the expression of
 MyD88, and transfection with pMyD88 led to the opposite results with what
 showed by NGR1 in LPS-stimulated HaCaT cells. To sum up, NGR1 alleviates
 LPS-induced HaCaT cell inflammatory injury by downregulation of MyD88, as
 well as inactivation of NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways.",
