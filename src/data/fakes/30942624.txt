    abstract "Histone H4 acetylation at lysine 12 (H4K12ac) has been reported
 to be associated with the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer. The study
 intends to study whether H4K12ac participates in regulating the carcinogenic
 effect of Ras-ERK1/2 on osteosarcoma (OS). The plasmids of pEGFP-N1,
 pEGFP-Ras(WT) and pEGFP-K-Ras(G12V/T35S) were transfected into MG-63 cells,
 the protein levels of H4K12ac and ERK1/2 were analyzed by Western blot.
 Effects of H4K12ac on cell proliferation and migration of MG-63 cells were
 tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium bromide
 solution (MTT), transwell, soft-agar colony formation and flow cytometry
 assays. Effect of H4K12ac on the transcription of ERK1/2 downstream genes was
 analyzed by RT-qPCR and ChIP assays. The involvements of HDAT6, HAT1 and MDM2
 in cell proliferation and migration of MG-63 cells were finally studied. We
 found that H4K12ac was specifically down-regulated by Ras-ERK1/2 activation
 in MG-63 cells. H4K12ac suppressed Ras-ERK1/2-induced cell viability, colony
 formation and migration in MG-63 cells. Additionally, HDAC6 silence recovered
 Ras-ERK1/2-repressed H4K12ac expression, as well as inhibited the
 carcinogenic effect of Ras-ERK1/2 on MG-63 cells. Besides, down-regulated
 H4K12ac induced by Ras-ERK1/2 was found to be associated with MDM2-mediated
 HAT1 degradation. In conclusion, these results testified that Ras-ERK1/2
 signalling promoted the development of OS by mediating H4K12ac through
 MDM2-mediated HAT1 degradation.",
