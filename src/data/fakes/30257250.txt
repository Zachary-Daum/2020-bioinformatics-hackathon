    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Inflammatory skin diseases are the most common
 problems in dermatology. Schizandrin A (SchA) has been reported to have
 anti-inflammatory properties. Herein, we aimed to investigate the protective
 effects of SchA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury in keratinocyte
 HaCaT cells. METHODS: Inflammation injury in HaCaT cells was induced by LPS
 treatment. Cell viability, apoptotic cell rate, and apoptosis-related
 proteins were analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, Annexin
 V-(fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/ Propidium Iodide (PI) double staining
 method, and western blot, respectively. The pro-inflammatory factors were
 analyzed by western blot and quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
 (ELISA). Expression of miR-127 in SchA-treated cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
 The effects of SchA on activations of p38MAPK/ERK and JNK pathways were
 analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: SchA protected HaCaT cells from
 LPS-induced inflammation damage via promoting cell viability, suppressing
 apoptosis. Meanwhile, SchA inhibited IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha
 expression. miR-127 expression was up-regulated in LPS-treated HaCaT cells
 but down-regulated after SchA treatment. Overexpression of miR-127 inhibited
 cell growth and induced expression of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha.
 Additionally, miR-127 overexpression impaired the protective effects of SchA,
 implying miR-127 might be correlated to the anti-inflammation property of
 SchA and also involved in inactivation of p38MAPK/ERK and JNK pathways by
 SchA. CONCLUSION: miR-127 is involved in the protective functions of SchA on
 LPS-induced inflammation injury in human keratinocyte cell HaCaT, which might
 inactivates of p38MAPK/ERK and JNK signaling pathways in HaCaT cells.",
