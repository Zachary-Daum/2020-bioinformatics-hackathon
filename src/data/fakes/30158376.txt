    abstract "Atherosclerosis is one of the most prevalent and important
 cardiac diseases, involving the heart and brain. This study aimed to explore
 the impacts of lncRNA Divergent to GSC induced by TGF-b family signaling
 (DIGIT) on vascular endothelial cells tube-formation capacity so as to reveal
 the potentials of DIGIT in atherosclerosis therapy. DIGIT expression in human
 microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells was silenced by transfection with
 shRNAs-targeted DIGIT. The effects of DIGIT silence on cell viability,
 migration, apoptosis, and tube formation were then assessed. Additionally,
 the cross-regulation between DIGIT and miR-134, and between miR-134 and Bmi-1
 was detected to further reveal through which mechanism (s) DIGIT mediated
 HMEC-1 cells. The results showed that DIGIT silence significantly reduced
 cell viability, migration, tube-like structures formation, and induced
 apoptosis in HMEC-1 cells. DIGIT worked as a sponge for miR-134, and the
 anti-growth, anti-migratory, and anti-tube-formation functions of DIGIT
 silence on HMEC-1 cells were abolished by miR-134 suppression. Bmi-1 was a
 target of miR-134, and Bmi-1 upregulation abolished miR-134
 overexpression-diminished cell growth, migration, and tube formation of
 HMEC-1 cells. Furthermore, Bmi-1 upregulation activated PI3K/AKT and Notch
 signaling pathways. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that lncRNA DIGIT
 accelerated tube formation of vascular endothelial cells through sponging
 miR-134. Our findings suggest that DIGIT and miR-134 may be promising
 molecular targets for atherosclerosis therapy.",
