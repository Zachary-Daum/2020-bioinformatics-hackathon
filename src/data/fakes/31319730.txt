    abstract "Arbutin (ARB) has been widely used in skin pigmentation
 disorders. Nevertheless, the involvements of ARB in diabetic nephropathy (DN)
 are still unknown. We investigated the functions of ARB in high glucose
 (HG)-induced cell apoptosis and autophagy in HK-2 cells. Cell viability was
 examined through CCK-8 in HK-2 cells after disposal with 45 mM glucose and
 ARB (10-50 muM). Flow cytometry and western blot tested cell apoptosis and
 the related protein levels in HK-2 cells after 45 mM glucose and 50 muM ARB
 administration. RT-qPCR delved microRNA (miR)-27a expression in HG and ARB
 co-treated HK-2 cells. Effect of miR-27a on ARB affected cell apoptosis and
 autophagy was investigated after miR-27a inhibitor transfection. JNK and mTOR
 pathways were finally assessed by western blot. ARB alleviated HG-induced
 cell apoptosis, autophagy and regulated the related protein levels in HK-2
 cells. MiR-27a expression was reduced in HG-treated cells, but was
 accelerated in HG and ARB co-treated HK-2 cells with the increased
 concentration. Inhibition of miR-27a apparently abolished the outcomes of ARB
 in HG-induced HK-2 cells apoptosis and autophagy. Besides, ARB blocked JNK
 and mTOR pathways by regulating miR-27a. The findings demonstrated that ARB
 alleviated apoptosis and autophagy in HG-treated HK-2 cells by regulating
 miR-27a/JNK/mTOR axis.",
