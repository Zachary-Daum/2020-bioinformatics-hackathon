    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative
 disorder with limited success in the prognosis of patients worldwide. The
 microRNA (miRNA) technology shows an encouraging trend in the therapeutics of
 AD. The study aimed to investigate the role of miR-132 and its underlying
 mechanism involving neuronal apoptosis and Tau phosphorylation in the
 pathophysiology of AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Frozen human postmortem brain
 samples and neurons cells were used as the specimens. The expression of
 miR-132 was assessed in AD and mild-cognitive (MCI) group by quantitative
 Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, miR-132 mimic,
 ASO-miR-132, and corresponding controls were transfected into necrotic cells.
 Flow cytometry was used to detected cell apoptosis in necrotic cells.
 qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation were used to quantify and
 identify apoptosis-related factors (Bax and Bcl-2), Tau phosphorylation,
 CDK-5, GTDC-1 levels in necrotic cells. Furthermore, Dual-Luciferase reporter
 assay was used to predict a direct target of miR-132. RESULTS: The expression
 of miR-132 was significantly higher in patients with MCI and AD compared to
 the normal group. Overexpression of miR-132 induced neuronal apoptosis by
 increasing Bax and decreasing Bcl-2 and also up-regulated phosphorylation of
 Tau, Rb, Histone H1, and CDK-5 expressions. Besides, GTDC-1 was identified as
 a direct target gene of miR-132. However, GTDC-1 markedly reversed the
 promoting effect of miR-132 on cell apoptosis and Tau phosphorylation.
 CONCLUSIONS: MiR-132 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD via
 regulation of cell apoptosis and GTDC-1/CDK-5/Tau phosphorylation signaling
 mechanism. It may be a potential therapeutic target in patients with AD.",
