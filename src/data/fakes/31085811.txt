    abstract "The regulatory role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) growth
 arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in both cancerous and noncancerous cells
 have been widely reported. This study aimed to evaluate the role of lncRNA
 GAS5 in heart failure caused by myocardial infarction. We reported that
 silence of lncRNA GAS5 attenuated hypoxia-triggered cell death, as cell
 viability was increased and apoptosis rate was decreased. This phenomenon was
 coupled with the down-regulated expression of p53, Bax and cleaved caspase-3,
 as well as the up-regulated expression of CyclinD1, CDK4 and Bcl-2. At the
 meantime, the expression of four heart failure-related miRNAs was altered
 when lncRNA GAS5 was silenced (miR-21 and miR-142-5p were up-regulated;
 miR-30b and miR-93 were down-regulated). RNA immunoprecipitation assay
 results showed that lncRNA GAS5 worked as a molecular sponge for miR-142-5p.
 More interestingly, the protective actions of lncRNA GAS5 silence on
 hypoxia-stimulated cells were attenuated by miR-142-5p suppression. Besides,
 TP53INP1 was a target gene for miR-142-5p. Silence of lncRNA GAS5 promoted
 the activation of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways in a
 miR-142-5p-dependent manner. Collectively, this study demonstrated that
 silence of lncRNA GAS5 protected H9c2 cells against hypoxia-induced injury
 possibly via sponging miR-142-5p, functionally releasing TP53INP1 mRNA
 transcripts that are normally targeted by miR-142-5p.",
