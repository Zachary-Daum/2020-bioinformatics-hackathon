    abstract "We planned to dig the significant role of long noncoding RNA
 HAGLROS in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and the latent mechanism. The
 levels of HAGLROS in NPC tissues and cells were determined, followed by
 correlation analysis of HAGLROS level and clinicopathological features of
 patients suffered with NPC. The impacts of HAGLROS dysregulation on NPC cell
 viability, apoptosis, and the expression of apoptotic proteins and
 autophagy-related symbols were investigated. Moreover, we explored whether
 HAGLROS modulated the expression of autophagy-related gene 14 (ATG14) by
 competitively sponging miR-100, and then regulated the briskness of
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR signals in NPC development. HAGLROS level in NPC tissues and
 cell was very high. High level of HAGLROS indicated a short overall survival
 in NPC patients. Depressing of HAGLROS lessened NPC cell viability, enhanced
 apoptosis and reduced autophagy. Besides, HAGLROS negative controlled miR-100
 and consequently targeted ATG14 expression, thus modulating NPC cell
 viability, apoptosis, and autophagy. Besides, dysregulation of
 HAGLROS/miR-100/ATG14 axis was correlated to the briskness of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
 signals in NPC cells. Our results indicate that of the augment of HAGLROS
 contributes to NPC development via modulating miR-100/ATG14 axis-mediated
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR signals. Our study will offer a comprehensive basis for better
 illustrating the pathogenesis of NPC. Highlights HAGLROS expression was
 upregulated in NPC tissues and cells. High expression of HAGLROS indicated a
 short overall survival in NPC patients. Silencing of HAGLROS promoted
 apoptosis and inhibited autophagy of NPC cells. HAGLROS regulated ATG14
 expression in NPC cells via sponging miR-100. HAGLROS/miR-100/ATG14 axis
 regulated NPC development via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",
