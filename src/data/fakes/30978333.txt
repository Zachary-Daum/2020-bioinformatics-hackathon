    abstract "BACKGROUND: Triptolide (TPL) is a potential anti-tumor natural
 compound. However, its role in nephroblastoma is poorly studied. Herein, we
 aimed to reveal the regulatory effects of TPL on human nephroblastoma cells
 (G-401 and WiT49) as well as the regulatory mechanism in G-401 cells.
 METHODS: Effects of TPL on cell viability, migration and apoptosis of G-401
 and WiT49 cells were measured by CCK-8 assay, Boyden Chamber, and flow
 cytometry/Western blot analysis, respectively. Expression of miR-193b-3p in
 TPL-treated G-401 and WiT49 cells was determined by RT-qPCR. Then, whether
 miR-193b-3p was the downstream factor of TPL was studied. Alteration of KLF4
 expression in TPL-treated cells and the relationship between miR-193b-3p and
 KLF4 were assessed by Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assay.
 Effects of abnormally expressed KLF4 on G-401 cells were also assessed.
 Finally, the involvements of PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways were measured by
 Western blot analysis. RESULTS: TPL reduced cell viability and migration
 while promoted apoptosis in G-401 and WiT49 cells. miR-193b-3p level was
 up-regulated by TPL stimulation, and TPL might function through regulation of
 miR-193b-3p. KLF4 expression was down-regulated by TPL, and KLF4 was proven
 to be a target gene of miR-193b-3p. TPL mediated the repressive roles in
 growth of nephroblastoma cells via KLF4 knockdown. Finally, we found
 phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT and ERK was inhibited by TPL, possibly through
 miR-193b-3p-mediated regulation of KLF4. CONCLUSION: TPL showed a tumor
 suppressive role in nephroblastoma cells via miR-193b-3p-mediated
 down-regulation of KLF4, along with inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and ERK
 pathways.",
