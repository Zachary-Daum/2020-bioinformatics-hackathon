    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of
 cancer related deaths worldwide. The role of several microRNAs (miRNAs)
 including miR-196b in different cancers has already been established. The
 study was aimed to explore the role of miR-196b in lung cancer and its
 possible underlying mechanism. METHODS: Human lung cancer cell line A549 was
 transfected with miR-196b mimic, miR-196b inhibitor and corresponding
 controls. Then cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of A549
 lung cancer cells either with overexpression or with suppression of miR-196b
 were estimated sequentially. Next, dual luciferase activity assay was
 performed to clarify whether Runx2 was a direct target of miR-196b. Finally,
 the expressions of main factors associated with epithelial mesenchymal
 transition (EMT), PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta, Smad, and JNK pathways were detected by
 western blot. RESULTS: MiR-196b expression was significantly decreased in
 A549, H1650 and H1299 cell lines compared with in WI-38 and HEL-1 cell lines.
 Overexpression of miR-196b suppressed cell viability, migration, invasion,
 and induced apoptosis as well as inhibited TGF-beta induced EMT process in
 A549 cells. In addition, Runx2 was a putative target of miR-196b, and Runx2
 silence remarkably increased cell apoptosis and abolished the promotive
 effects of miR-196b suppression on cell viability, migration and invasion.
 Finally, miR-196b also mediated its action by inactivation of
 PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta, Smad, and JNK pathways by down-regulation of Runx2.
 CONCLUSION: MiR-196b functions as a tumor suppressor that inhibited cell
 growth and metastasis of lung cancer cells by targeting Runx2. These findings
 provided further evidences for treatment of lung cancer.",
