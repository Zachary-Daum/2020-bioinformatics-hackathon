    abstract "Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer of the immature retina. This
 study designed to see the function of the lncRNA ANRIL in retinoblastoma Y79
 cells. ANRIL, miR-99a and c-Myc expression in Y79 cells was altered by
 transfection and then trypan blue, transwell assay and flow cytometry were
 carried out to evaluate the changes of cell phenotype. The connection between
 ANRIL, miR-99a and c-Myc was measured by luciferase reporter assay and RNA
 immunoprecipitation analysis. As a result, ANRIL expression was highly
 expressed in human retinoblastoma tissue as relative to the adjacent
 noncancerous tissues. ANRIL suppression inhibited Y79 cells viability,
 migration, invasion, while promoted apoptosis. ANRIL negatively regulated
 miR-99a by binding to miR-99a. Silence of miR-99a reversed the
 ANRIL-knockdown effects on Y79 cells. miR-99a overexpression suppressed Y79
 cell viability, migration, invasion, and enhanced apoptosis through
 downregulating c-Myc. Meanwhile, we found that miR-99a inhibited JAK/STAT and
 PI3K/AKT pathways. To conclude, it seems that ANRIL suppression inhibits cell
 growth and metastasis in retinoblastoma Y79 cells by regulating miR-99a and
 c-Myc.",
