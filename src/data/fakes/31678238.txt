    abstract "BACKGROUND: Hypoxia was proven to cause brain cell apoptosis and
 autophagy. Herein, we tested the influences of propofol, a commonly used
 intravenous sedative hypnotic drug, on apoptosis and autophagy aroused by
 hypoxia stimulation in PC-12 and HT-22 cells. METHODS: Followed by hypoxia
 and/or propofol treatment, cell viability of PC-12 and HT-22 cells, apoptosis
 and autophagy, along with microRNA-137 (miR-137) expression were measured,
 respectively. Then, miR-137 inhibitor was transfected to silence miR-137.
 Whether miR-137 took part in the impacts of propofol on hypoxia-exposed cells
 was explored. Finally, the activities of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK pathways were
 measured. RESULTS: Hypoxia stimulation aroused cell apoptosis and elevated
 cell autophagy in PC-12 and HT-22 cells. Propofol weakened the apoptosis and
 autophagy of PC-12 and HT-22 cells aroused by hypoxia. Moreover, propofol
 elevated the miR-137 level in PC-12 and HT-22 cells. Silencing miR-137
 declined the influences of propofol on hypoxia-induced injuries. Besides,
 propofol promoted PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK pathways activation in
 hypoxia-exposed cells through raising miR-137. CONCLUSION: Propofol weakened
 hypoxia-aroused apoptosis and autophagy of PC-12 and HT-22 cells might be
 through raising miR-137 level and thereby promoting PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK
 pathways activation.",
