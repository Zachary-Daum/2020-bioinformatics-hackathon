    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ganoderic acid A (GAA) isolated from Ganoderma
 lucidum, shows various benefit activities, such as anti-tumor activity,
 anti-HIV activity and hepatoprotective activity. However, the potential
 effects of GAA on hypoxia-induced injury of cardiomyocytes are still unclear.
 In this study, we aimed to reveal the effects of GAA on hypoxic-induced H9c2
 cell injury, as well as potential underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS:
 Rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes were cultured in hypoxia condition with different
 doses of GAA. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 assay and
 flow cytometry, respectively. qRT-PCR was performed to assess the expression
 levels of microRNA-182-5p (miR-182-5p) and phosphatase and tensin homologue
 (PTEN). Cell transfection was conducted to change the expression levels of
 miR-182-5p and PTEN in H9c2 cells. Finally, protein levels of key factors
 involved in cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway were
 evaluated using western blotting. RESULTS: Hypoxia treatment significantly
 induced H9c2 cell viability loss and apoptosis. GAA incubation remarkably
 protected H9c2 cells from hypoxia-induced viability loss, proliferation
 inhibition and apoptosis. In addition, GAA obviously enhanced the expression
 level of miR-182-5p in H9c2 cells. Suppression of miR-182-5p notably
 alleviated the protective effects of GAA on hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells.
 Furthermore, miR-182-5p negatively regulated the mRNA and protein levels of
 PTEN in H9c2 cells. GAA attenuated hypoxia-induced inactivation of PI3K/AKT
 pathway in H9c2 cells by up-regulating miR-182-5p and then down-regulating
 PTEN. CONCLUSION: GAA protected rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-induced
 injury might via up-regulating miR-182-5p, down-regulating PTEN and then
 activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",
