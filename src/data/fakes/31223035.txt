    abstract "Background: Cardiomyocytes loss is the predominant pathogenic
 characteristic in the hypoxia-induced injury. Meanwhile, it has been
 corroborated that Bcl-2 E1B 19-KDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) provokes
 apoptosis and autophagy. For moderating cardiomyocytes loss, we initially
 probed the cyto-protection effects of 6-Gingerol (6 G), meanwhile, its
 potential mechanisms associated with BNIP3 were elucidated in our studies.
 Methods: We pretreated cardiomyocytes H9c2 cells with 6 G at different
 concentrations (0-100 muM) before exposure to hypoxia. Thereafter, the cell
 viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), apoptosis and protein expression were
 respectively assessed using cell counting kit-8 and methyl thiazolyl
 tetrazolium (MTT) assay, LDH assay kit, Annexin V-fluorescein
 isothiocyannate/propidium iodide (Annexin V-FITC/PI) apoptosis detection kit
 and Western blotting analysis. In addition, we also analyzed BNIP3 level
 after treatment. Moreover, we enforced the exogenous overexpression of BNIP3
 and then evaluated the cell viability, apoptosis, and protein level again.
 Results: In our present work, we observed that the cell viability was
 promoted by 6 G in the hypoxia-induced H9c2 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
 Moreover, hypoxia-induced LDH release, apoptosis and autophagy were inhibited
 by 6 G pretreatment through promoting phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT and mTOR.
 Remarkably, accumulation of BNIP3 protein was significantly reduced by 6 G in
 hypoxia-induced H9c2 cells. Mechanistically, 6 G initiated the phosphorylated
 expression of PI3K, AKT and mTOR by down-regulating BNIP3 with reducing
 cardiomyocytes apoptosis and autophagy. Conclusion: Hypoxia-induced
 cardiomyocytes injury was ameliorated by 6 G through suppressing BNIP3
 expression with triggering PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.",
