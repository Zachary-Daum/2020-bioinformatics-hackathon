    abstract "BACKGROUND: Propofol is a commonly used anaesthetic with
 controversial effects on cancer cells. We aimed to explore the functional
 roles of propofol in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells as well as the
 underlying mechanisms. METHODS: HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were used in this
 study. Firstly, the effects of propofol on cell viability, migration,
 invasion, apoptosis, and involved proteins were assessed by Cell Counting
 Kit-8 assay, Transwell assay, flow cytometry assay and Western blot analysis,
 respectively. Subsequently, alteration of miR-374a after stimulation of
 propofol was analyzed by qRT-PCR. miR-374a was overexpressed and the
 alteration of proteins in the Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT pathways was
 detected by Western blot analysis. The downstream factor of miR-374a was
 finally studied. RESULTS: Propofol inhibited cell viability, migration and
 invasion but promoted apoptosis of HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. Meanwhile,
 cyclinD1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were down-regulated
 while Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were up-regulated by
 propofol. Then, miR-374a level was reduced by propofol. Expression of Wnt3a,
 beta-catenin, p-PI3K and p-AKT was decreased by propofol, whereas these
 decreases were reversed by miR-374a overexpression. Finally, TP53 was proven
 to be target of miR-374a in HepG2 cells. CONCLUSION: Propofol inhibited cell
 proliferation, migration and invasion while promoted cell apoptosis of HepG2
 and SMMC-7721 cells through inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/ AKT
 pathways via down-regulation of miR-374a. Besides, miR-374a affected
 propofol-treated HepG2 cells by targeting TP53.",
