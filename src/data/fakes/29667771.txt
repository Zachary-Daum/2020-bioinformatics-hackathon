    abstract "This study aimed to elucidate the roles of long non-coding RNA
 SNHG14 in gastric cancer development. LncRNA SNHG14 was markedly up-regulated
 in gastric cancer tissues and cells. Knockdown of SNHG14 significantly
 inhibited SGC-7901 cell viability, migration, invasion, and promoted cell
 apoptosis. In addition, miR-145 was negatively regulated by SNHG14 and the
 effects of SNHG14 knockdown on cell viability, apoptosis, migration,
 invasion, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and EMT-markers
 were reversed by inhibition of miR-145 at the same time. Furthermore, SOX9
 was verified as a functional target of miR-145, and miR-145 regulated tumor
 malignant behaviors through regulating SOX9. Besides, knockdown of SNHG14
 inhibited the expression of p-PI3 K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR and promoted PTEN
 expression, where miR-145 inhibition had opposite effects. Moreover, the
 activated PI3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway caused by miR-145 inhibition was
 counteracted after knockdown of SOX9. Our findings indicate that
 up-regulation of lncRNA SNHG14 may contribute to gastric cancer development
 via targeting miR-145/SOX9 axis and involving in PI3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
 SNHG14-miR-145/SOX9 axis may be a promising therapeutic strategy for gastric
 cancer treatment.",
