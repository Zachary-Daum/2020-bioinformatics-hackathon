    abstract "BACKGROUND: Human urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) has
 been recognized as an oncogenic lncRNA in various cancers, except infantile
 hemangioma (IH). This study attempts to explore the functional role of lncRNA
 UCA1 in IH. METHODS: qRT-PCR was carried out to detect the expression of
 lncRNA UCA1 in human IH tissues. Two hemangioma cell lines (EOMA and HemECs)
 were transfected with shRNAs specific for lncRNA UCA1, or a plasmid for
 expression lncRNA UCA1. The expression of miR-200c in cell was suppressed or
 overexpressed by miRNA-mediated transfection. CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry,
 Transwell assay, and Western blot were performed to detect cell survival,
 migration and invasion. RESULTS: LncRNA UCA1 was up-regulated in
 proliferating-phase hemangioma samples, as compared to involuting-phase.
 Silence of lncRNA UCA1 significantly reduced EOMA cells viability, migration
 and invasion, and induced apoptosis. These observations were coupled with the
 down-regulations of CyclinD1, CDK6 and CDK4, the cleavage of caspase-3 and
 caspase-9, as well as the decreased expression levels of MMP-9 and Vimentin.
 miR-200c was highly expressed in lncRNA UCA1 silenced-cells. Besides, the
 anti-tumor effects of lncRNA UCA1 silence towards EOMA cells were reversed by
 miR-200c suppression. Same effects of lncRNA UCA1 and miR-200c on HemECs
 cells were observed. Furthermore, silence of lncRNA UCA1 repressed mTOR, AMPK
 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling via a miR-200c-dependent fashion. CONCLUSION:
 This study evidences that silence of lncRNA UCA1 inhibits hemangioma cells
 growth, migration and invasion possibly via its regulation on miR-200c
 expression and the activation of mTOR, AMPK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
 pathways.",
