    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurs when
 blood supply to the heart is diminished (ischemia) for long time; ischemia is
 primarily caused due to hypoxia. The present study evaluated the effects of
 long non-coding RNA H19 on hypoxic rat H9c2 cells and mouse HL-1 cells.
 METHODS: Hypoxic injury was confirmed by measuring cell viability, migration
 and invasion, and apoptosis using MTT, Transwell and flow cytometry assays,
 respectively. H19 expression after hypoxia was estimated by qRT-PCR. We then
 measured the effects of non-physiologically expressed H19, knockdown of
 miR-139 with or without H19 silence, and abnormally expressed Sox8 on
 hypoxia-induced H9c2 cells. Moreover, the interacted miRNA for H19 and
 downstream target gene were virtually screened and verified. The involved
 signaling pathways and the effects of abnormally expressed H19 on
 contractility of HL-1 cells were explored via Western blot analysis. RESULTS:
 Hypoxia induced decreases of cell viability, migration and invasion, increase
 of cell apoptosis and up-regulation of H19. Knockdown of H19 increased
 hypoxia-induced injury in H9c2 cells. H19 acted as a sponge for miR-139 and
 H19 knockdown aggravated hypoxia-induced injury by up-regulating miR-139.
 Sox8 was identified as a target of miR-139, and its expression was negatively
 regulated by miR-139. The mechanistic studies revealed that overexpression of
 Sox8 might decrease hypoxia-induced cell injury by activating the
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and MAPK. Besides, H19 promoted contractility of HL-1
 cells. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that H19 alleviates hypoxia-induced
 myocardial cell injury by miR-139-mediated up-regulation of Sox8, along with
 activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and MAPK.",
