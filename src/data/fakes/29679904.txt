    abstract "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is the most common bone-joint disease
 in middle and older people all over the world. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) is
 the main lipophilic diterpenoid isolated from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza
 Bunge (Lamiaceae). This study analyzed the protective effects of Tan IIA on
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cell inflammatory
 injury model. METHODS: Cell viability was assessed using cell counting kit-8
 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining.
 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to measure the
 concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha
 (TNF-alpha) in the culture supernatant of ATDC5 cells. qRT-PCR was performed
 to determine the expression of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and microRNA-203a
 (miR-203a) in ATDC5 cells. Cell transfection was used to enhance the
 expression of miR-203a. Protein expression of key factors involved in
 apoptosis, pro-inflammatory reaction, Janus kinase/signal transducers and
 activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)
 pathways were evaluated using western blotting. RESULTS: LPS significantly
 induced ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury, as evidenced by the loss of cell
 viability, enhancement of cell apoptosis and increases of pro-inflammatory
 factors expression. Tan IIA obviously alleviated LPS-induced ATDC5 cell
 inflammatory injury and down-regulated the expression of miR-203a.
 Overexpression of miR-203a obviously promoted ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury
 and remarkably reversed the protective effects of Tan IIA on LPS-induced
 ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury by influencing JAK/STAT and JNK pathways.
 CONCLUSION: Our research verified that Tan IIA protected ATDC5 cells from
 LPS-induced inflammatory injury by down-regulating miR-203a and suppressing
 JAK/STAT and JNK pathways.",
