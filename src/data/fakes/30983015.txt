    abstract "The atherosclerosis in the arterial system of the extremities is
 considered as the major pathogenesis of peripheral arterial disease. The
 present work aimed to explore the potential role of long noncoding RNA
 activated by tumor growth factor-beta (lncRNA-ATB) on the dysfunction of
 endothelial cells. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were
 transfected with lncRNA-ATB expressing vectors, and then the formation of
 tubes and expression of proteins associated with angiogenesis were analyzed
 using microscope and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain
 reaction (RT-qPCR)/Western blot analysis. Cell viability, migration, and
 microRNA-195 (miR-195) expression were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay,
 modified Boyden chambers, Western blot analysis, and RT-qPCR. The interaction
 between lncRNA-ATB and miR-195 was determined by RT-qPCR, dual-luciferase
 reporter assay, and biotin-avidin pull-down assay. Finally, expression of key
 kinases in the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways was determined by Western blot
 analysis. We found vascular tubulogenesis was induced spontaneously when
 HMEC-1 cells were cultured in Matrigel-coated plates. lncRNA-ATB
 overexpression increased cell viability, migration and formation of tubes,
 along with upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and
 vascular endothelial growth factor. Then, we found lncRNA-ATB worked as a
 molecular sponge for miR-195, and the effects of lncRNA-ATB on HMEC-1 cells
 were reversed by miR-195 overexpression while were augmented by miR-195
 inhibition. Phosphorylated levels of key kinases in the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK
 pathways were increased by lncRNA-ATB via miR-195. In conclusion, lncRNA-ATB
 enhanced cell viability, migration and angiogenesis in HMEC-1 cells through
 sponging miR-195. Moreover, the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways were activated
 by lncRNA-ATB via miR-195.",
