    abstract "BACKGROUND: The cardioprotective role of Angelica sinensis has
 been proven in previous studies. However, the effects of Angelica sinensis
 polysaccharide (ASP, major bioactive component of Angelica sinensis) on
 myocardial infarction (MI) remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate
 the effects of ASP on hypoxia-induced H9c2 cell injury as well as the
 underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We constructed in vitro hypoxic model to
 mimic MI. Cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis were respectively
 measured by using CCK-8 assay, Western blot analysis, and flow cytometry
 assay/Western blot analysis, to evaluate cell injury after treatments. The
 effects of ASP pretreatment on hypoxia-induced injury were explored.
 Expression of miR-22 after treatments was determined by stem-loop RT-PCR, and
 whether ASP affected H9c2 cells via miR-22 was studied. Involvements of the
 PI3K/AKT and JAK1/STAT3 pathways were finally explored. RESULTS:
 Hypoxia-induced decreases of cell viability and proliferation as well as
 increase of apoptosis were attenuated by ASP pretreatments. Hypoxia treatment
 up-regulated miR-22 expression, and the up-regulation was mitigated by ASP
 pretreatment. Effects of ASP pretreatment on hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells were
 mitigated by miR-22 overexpression while were augmented by miR-22 inhibition.
 Phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, JAK1 and STAT3 were increased by ASP
 through down-regulating miR-22 in hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells. CONCLUSION: ASP
 pretreatment attenuated hypoxia-induced H9c2 cell injury, possibly through
 down-regulating miR-22 expression. The PI3K/AKT and JAK1/STAT3 pathways were
 activated by ASP pretreatment via miR-22 in hypoxia-treated cells.",
