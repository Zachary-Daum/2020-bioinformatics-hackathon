    abstract "Breast cancer (BC) is a common malignancy which is the most
 frequently diagnosed cancer in women all over the worldwide. This study aimed
 to investigate the roles of miR-1469 in the development of BC, as well as its
 regulatory mechanism. The expression levels of miR-1469 in BC tissues, serum,
 and cell lines were determined. Effects of overexpression of miR-1469 on MCF7
 cell viability, colony-forming ability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion
 were then investigated. Furthermore, the potential target of miR-1469 in MCF7
 cells was explored. Besides, the association between miR-1469, PTEN/PI3K/AKT,
 and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways was elucidated. Notably, confirmatory
 experiments by downregulation of miR-1469 in SK-BR-3 cells were further
 performed. The miR-1469 expression was significantly downregulated in BC
 tissues, serum, and cell lines. The overexpression of miR-1469 significantly
 inhibited the proliferation, arrested cell-cycle at G2/M phase, increased
 apoptosis, suppressed migration, and invasion of MCF-7 cells. In addition,
 HOXA1 was verified as a direct target of miR-1469, and the effects of
 overexpression of miR-1469 on the malignant behaviors of MCF7 cells were
 significantly counteracted by overexpression of HOXA1 concurrently.
 Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-1469 suppressed the activation of
 PTEN/PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways, which was reversed
 overexpression of HOXA1 concurrently. Besides, confirmatory experiments
 showed that the inhibition of miR-1469 promoted the malignant behaviors of
 SK-BR-3 cells, which was inversed after miR-1469 inhibition and HOXA1
 knockdown at the same time. Our findings reveal that downregulation of
 miR-1469 may promote the development of BC by targeting HOXA1 and activating
 PTEN/PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. MiR-1469 may serve as a
 promising target for BC therapy.",
