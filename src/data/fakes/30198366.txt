    abstract "MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) play vital roles in various immune
 diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The current study
 aimed to assess the role of miR-145 in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-treated HaCaT
 cells under ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation and further explore the potential
 regulatory mechanism. HaCaT cells were pretreated with IL-6 and then exposed
 to UVB to assess the effect of IL-6 on sensitivity of HaCaT cells to UVB
 irradiation. The levels of miR-145 and MyD88 were altered by transfection and
 the transfected efficiency was verified by quantitative reverse transcription
 polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)/western blot analysis. Cell viability,
 percentage of apoptotic cells and expression levels of apoptosis-related
 factors were measured by trypan blue assay, flow cytometry assay, and western
 blot analysis, respectively. In addition, the levels of c-Jun N-terminal
 kinases (JNK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway-related
 factors were assessed by western blot analysis. IL-6 treatments significantly
 aggravated the reduction of cell viability and promotion of cell apoptosis
 caused by UVB irradiation in HaCaT cells. Interestingly, miR-145 level was
 augmented by UVB exposure and miR-145 mimic alleviated IL-6-induced increase
 of sensitivity to UVB irradiation in HaCaT cells, as dramatically increased
 cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis. Opposite effects were observed in
 miR-145 inhibitor-transfected cells. Meanwhile, MyD88 was negatively
 regulated by miR-145 and MyD88 mediated the regulatory effect of miR-145 on
 IL-6- and UVB-treated cells. In addition, miR-145 mimic inhibited the JNK and
 NF-kappaB pathways by down-regulating MyD88. In conclusion, the present study
 demonstrated that miR-145 alleviated IL-6-induced increase of sensitivity to
 UVB irradiation by down-regulating MyD88 in HaCaT cells.",
