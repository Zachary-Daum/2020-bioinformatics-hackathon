    abstract "BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt loss of
 kidney function. MicroRNA-30b (miR-30b) has been reported to be involved in
 the inflammatory reaction of a variety of diseases. However, the role of
 miR-30b in AKI remains unknown. In this research, we aimed to investigate the
 role of miR-30b in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced kindey inflammatory
 injury in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: In vitro, after miR-30b mimic/inhibitor
 transfection and/or LPS treatment, the viability, apoptosis, autophagy and
 inflammatory cytokines releases, as well as activation of c-Jun-N-terminal
 kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways were detected by
 cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, enzyme-linked
 immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot, respectively. In vivo, after
 LPS treatment and/or anti-miR-30b administration, the levels of creatinine,
 the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologic scores, as
 well as concentrations of inflammatory cytokines were assessed by creatinine
 assay kit, ALT assay kit and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: LPS inhibited HK-2
 cell viability and induced HK-2 cell apoptosis, autophagy and the releases of
 inflammatory cytokines. Overexpression of miR-30b promoted LPS-induced HK-2
 cell viability inhibition, cell inflammatory cytokines releases, cell
 apoptosis induction and activation of JNK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways,
 but inhibited LPS-induced HK-2 cell autophagy. Suppression of miR-30b had
 opposite effects. Moreover, suppression of miR-30b alleviated the LPS-induced
 kidney injury in mice model by decreasing creatinine level, ALT activity and
 histologic scores, as well as concentrations of inflammatory cytokines.
 CONCLUSION: miR-30b participated in the LPS-induced kindey inflammatory
 injury in vitro and in vivo.",
