    abstract "BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1
 (lncRNA-UCA1) is generally recognized as an oncogenic molecule in several
 human malignant tumors. However, the available evidence does not necessarily
 imply an unequivocal causal function of UCA1 in glioblastoma. The current
 study was aimed to probe the biological function of lncRNA-UCA1 in human
 glioblastoma cell lines. Besides, we further investigated the potential
 mechanisms. METHODS: Cell viability, apoptosis, as well as migration and
 invasion were measured using a commercial cell counting kit-8, flow
 cytometry, and 24-Transwell assay, respectively. LncRNA-UCA1, microRNA-193a
 (miR-193a), and CDK6 at messenger RNA levels were evaluated by quantitative
 real-time polymerase chain reaction method. Protein level was examined by
 Western blot analysis. RNA immunoprecipitation was utilized to validate
 lncRNA-UCA1 associated with miR-193a. Luciferase activity assay was used to
 identify the miR-193a-targeted CDK6 3'-untranslated region. RESULTS:
 lncRNA-UCA1 knockdown weakened cell viability, augmented apoptosis
 progression, as well as suppressed migration and invasion behaviors in
 glioblastoma cells, whereas lncRNA-UCA1 silence exhibited the opposite
 functions. lncRNA-UCA1 functioned as an endogenous sponge of miR-193a.
 miR-193a silence reversed the biological function of lncRNA-UCA1 knockdown on
 U-118 MG cells. miR-193a negatively regulated the expression of CDK6, and it
 affected the U-118 MG cells through regulating CDK6 expression. CDK6
 overexpression abrogated the blockage of PI3K/AKT, mitogen-activated protein
 kinase (MAPK), and Notch signaling pathways. Furthermore, lncRNA-UCA1 and
 miR-193a could affect these signaling cascades through regulating CDK6
 expression. The regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA-UCA1 were further
 consolidated in clinical specimens. CONCLUSION: lncRNA-UCA1 silence reduced
 cell viability, promoted apoptosis progression, while impeding the migration
 and invasion of glioblastoma cells by miR-193a-mediated silence of CDK6, with
 blockage of PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and Notch pathways.",
