    abstract "Various circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to involve
 in carcinoma. This study explored the role and mechanism of circRNA
 circFNDC3B (circFNDC3B) in renal carcinoma (RC). The detection indicators in
 this paper were viability, colony, and migration, which respectively
 investigated by Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, and migration assay.
 Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction tested and cell
 transfection changed circFNDC3B and miR-99a expression. Moreover, western
 blot tested relate-proteins of proliferation, migration, and cell pathways
 were examined by western blot. circFNDC3B was upregulated at RC tissues.
 circFNDC3B enhanced cell viability, colony and migration, and miR-99a mimic
 played reverse impacts. Furthermore, circFNDC3B negatively regulated
 miR-99aand circFNDC3B restrained the janus kinase 1/signal transducer and
 activator of transcription 3 (JAK1/STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated
 kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK pathways by miR-99a downregulation.
 Overexpression of circFNDC3B enhanced cell viability, colony formation and
 migration by miR-99a downregulation via JAK1/STAT3 and MEK/ERK pathways.",
