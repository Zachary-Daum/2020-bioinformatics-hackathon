    abstract "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a clinically
 familiar disease, which possesses a great negative impact on human health.
 But, the effective treatment is still absent. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been
 testified to play a momentous role in MIRI. The purpose of the study aimed to
 probe the functions of miR-132 in oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-evoked
 injury in H9c2 cells. miR-132 expression in H9c2 cells accompanied by OGD
 disposition was evaluated via real-time quantitative polymerase chain
 reaction. After miR-132 mimic and inhibitor transfections, the impacts of
 miR-132 on OGD-affected H9c2 cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, and the
 interrelated factors were appraised by exploiting cell counting kit-8, flow
 cytometry, and western blot analysis. FOXO3A expression was estimated in
 above-transfected cells, meanwhile, the correlation between miR-132 and
 FOXO3A was probed by dual-luciferase report assay. Ultimately, above
 mentioned cell processes were reassessed in H9c2 cells after preprocessing
 OGD administration and transfection with si-FOXO3A and si-NC plasmids. We got
 that OGD disposition obviously enhanced miR-132 expression in H9c2 cells.
 Overexpressed miR-132 evidently reversed OGD-evoked cell viability repression
 and apoptosis induction in H9c2 cells. In addition, overexpressed miR-132
 mitigated OGD-evoked G0/G1 cell arrest by mediating p21, p27, and cyclin D1
 expression. Repression of FOXO3A was observed in miR-132 mimic-transfected
 cells, which was also predicated as a direct gene of miR-132. We discovered
 that silenced FOXO3A alleviated OGD-evoked cell injury in H9c2 cells via
 facilitating cell viability, hindering apoptosis and restraining cell arrest
 at G0/G1 phase. In conclusion, these investigations corroborated that miR-132
 exhibited the protective impacts on H9c2 cells against OGD-evoked injury via
 targeting FOXO3A.",
