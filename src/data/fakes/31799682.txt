    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether circHIPK3 could inhibit
 proliferation and induce apoptosis of cardiomyocytes via binding to
 miRNA-124-3p, thus aggravating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury.
 MATERIALS AND METHODS: CircHIPK3 expression in HCM cells simulated with
 myocardial I/R was determined by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain
 Reaction (qRT-PCR). Influences of circHIPK3 on myocardial injury marker
 levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide
 dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in the in vitro model of
 myocardial I/R were evaluated using the relative commercial kits. The
 regulatory effects of circHIPK3 on proliferative ability and apoptosis of
 simulated HCM cells were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and
 flow cytometry, respectively. Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay was
 conducted to verify the binding of circHIPK3 to miRNA-124-3p. Finally, the
 roles of the circHIPK3/miRNA-124-3p axis in regulating apoptotic gene
 expressions and cardiomyocyte repair after myocardial I/R were explored.
 RESULTS: CircHIPK3 was highly expressed in HCM cells with simulated
 myocardial I/R relative to those with normoxic treatment. The overexpression
 of circHIPK3 in simulated HCM cells decreased levels of LDH, SOD and GSH-PX,
 whereas increased the MDA level. Inhibited proliferation and accelerated
 apoptosis were observed in simulated HCM cells overexpressing circHIPK3.
 Western blot analyses illustrated that circHIPK3 overexpression upregulated
 pro-apoptotic Bax, and downregulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Subsequently, we
 confirmed the binding between circHIPK3 and miRNA-124-3p. Rescue experiments
 demonstrated that circHIPK3 overexpression reversed the protective effects of
 miRNA-124-3p on myocardial I/R and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS:
 CircHIPK3 inhibits proliferative ability and induces apoptosis of
 cardiomyocytes after myocardial I/R injury by binding to miRNA-124-3p, which
 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for I/R.",
