    abstract "Salidroside, a glycoside of tyrosol, is isolated from Rhodiola
 rosea and shows anti-cancer functions in several cancers. However, the
 potentials of salidroside in the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells
 and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the
 functions and mechanisms of salidroside in non-small cell lung cancer
 (NSCLC). Human NSCLC cell line A549 was treated with different doses of
 salidroside. Cell viability, colony formation, apoptosis, migration and
 invasion were detected by CCK-8, crystal violet-staining assay, flow
 cytometry and transwell assay, respectively. qRT-PCR and western blot
 analysis were performed to assess the regulatory effects of salidroside on
 miR-195 expression and the activation of AKT and the MEK/ERK signal pathway.
 We found that, salidroside remarkably reduced cell viability, colony
 formation and Cyclin D1 expression, but increased p21 expression and
 apoptosis in A549 cells. Additionally, salidroside inhibited the migration
 and invasion of A549 cells by regulating expressions of migration- and
 invasion-related proteins. Finally, salidroside inhibited phosphorylation of
 AKT, MEK and ERK by upregulating miR-195 expression in A549 cells. In
 conclusion, salidroside inhibited the survival, migration and invasion of
 NSCLC cells. Salidroside blocked AKT and the MEK/ERK signal pathway by
 upregulating miR-195 expression in A549 cells.",
