    abstract "Recently, the impacts of noncoding RNAs on the initiation and
 development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) have aroused wide
 attention. Herein, we tested the impacts of autophagy-related circular RNA
 (ACR) on in vitro cell model of DPN. Rat Schwann RSC96 cells underwent high
 glucose (HG) irritation. The ACR expression, cell viability, apoptosis,
 autophagy, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were tested,
 respectively. Exogenous PLCDH-ACR transfection was utilized for probing the
 impacts of ACR on HG-irritated Schwann cells 96 (RSC96). Then, whether
 microRNA-145-3p (miR-145-3p) attended to the impacts of ACR on HG-irritated
 RSC96 cells was measured. Finally, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein
 kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway activity was
 evaluated. HG lowered ACR expression in RSC96 cells. Exogenous PLCDH-ACR
 transfection relieved HG-aroused RSC96 cell apoptosis, autophagy and ROS
 generation. Moreover, exogenous PLCDH-ACR transfection declined miR-145-3p
 expression in HG-irritated RSC96 cells. miR-145-3p engaged in the impacts of
 ACR on HG-aroused RSC96 cell apoptosis, autophagy, and ROS generation.
 Besides, exogenous PLCDH-ACR transfection promoted PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
 activation in HG-irritated RSC96 cells through declining miR-145-3p
 expression. This study disclosed that ACR relieved HG-aroused RSC96 cell
 apoptosis, autophagy and ROS generation might be via declining miR-145-3p and
 then promoting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation.",
