    abstract "Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common endocrine
 malignancy. Studies have confirmed an association between microRNA (miRNA)
 and the BRAF(V600E) mutation in various cellular biological processes of PTC.
 This study aimed to clarify the potential relationship between miR-150-5p and
 the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC. Human PTC cell lines B-CPAP and TPC-1 were
 transfected with the miR-150-5p mimic, an inhibitor, and the corresponding
 controls. Then, cell proliferation, viability, and apoptosis were detected by
 bromodeoxyuridine, trypan blue exclusion, and flow cytometry assays. The
 expressions of the main factors of cell cycle, epithelial mesenchymal
 transition (EMT), and DNA mismatch repair were examined by Western blot
 analysis and a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
 Additionally, pc-BRAF(V600E) was transfected into B-CPAP and TPC-1 cells to
 determine the relationship between miR-150-5p and BRAF(V600E) . In addition,
 the methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
 signal pathway was examined using Western blot analysis. Overexpression of
 miR-150-5p promoted cell proliferation and viability, inhibited apoptosis,
 and upregulated cell cycle factor expressions at 50 passages of B-CPAP and
 TPC-1 cells after transfection. Overexpression of miR-150-5p led to an
 obvious decrease in E-cadherin expression, but enhanced N-cadherin, Slug and
 Vimentin, ZEB1, and Snail expression. Moreover, overexpression of miR-150-5p
 markedly suppressed POLD3, MSH2, and MSH3 expression. Furthermore,
 BRAF(V600E) overexpression increased the expression level of miR-150-5p in
 TPC cells, and overexpression of telomerase reverse transcriptase further
 enhanced the promoting effect of BRAF(V600E) on miR-150-5p expression in
 B-CPAP and TPC-1 cells. Finally, BRAF(V600E) overexpression activated the
 MEK/ERK signal pathway in B-CPAP and TPC-1 cells. These data indicated that
 miR-150-5p promoted cell proliferation, suppressed apoptosis, and accelerated
 the EMT process by regulation of the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Our findings will
 help elucidate the pathogenesis of PTC and identify biomarkers.",
