    abstract "Long noncoding RNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 1
 (PCAT-1) is overexpressed in human malignancies and its silence abates the
 exaggeration of cancers. Whereas, the activity of PCAT-1 silence in ovarian
 cancer (OC) remains elusive. Here, our study was designed to corroborate the
 function of PCAT-1 silence in cellular activities and the molecular
 mechanisms. PCAT-1 in human ovarian tumor tissue specimens and cell lines
 (A2780 and SKOV3) were quantified by real-time quantitative reverse
 polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Reinforced silence of PCAT-1 and
 microRNA (miR)-124-3p was established by transfection and identified by
 qRT-PCR. The viability, apoptosis as well as migration and invasion were
 examined. Western blot was exploited for analysis of proteins involved in
 proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, and signaling transduction.
 OC tissues showed the accumulation of PCAT-1. Silencing PCAT-1 caused the
 impediment of proliferation, migration, and invasion with the increase in
 apoptosis. PCAT-1 knockdown repressed the expression of cyclin D1, CDK6, p53,
 Bax, cleaved caspase-3, metallopeptidases, and vimentin with the restoration
 of miR-124-3p. However, the roles of PCAT-1 silence were weakened in the
 absence of miR-124-3p. PCAT-1 silence caused decrease in Wnt3a, beta-catenin,
 and phosphorylation of protein kinase B and mechanistic target of rapamycin
 was abolished by miR-124-3p inhibitor. The tumor-suppressive role of PCAT-1
 silence was mediated by miR-124-3p.",
