    abstract "Myocarditis is a cardiomyopathy associated with inflammatory
 response. It has been reported that geniposide (GEN), a traditional Chinese
 herb extract from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, possesses an anti-inflammatory
 effect and a protective effect on cardiomyocytes. The present study aimed to
 explore the protective role of GEN and the underlying mechanism in
 LPS-injured H9c2 cells. H9c2 cells were treated with LPS to induce cell
 injury and then we investigated the effect of GEN. miR-145 expression was
 inhibited by transfection with miR-145 inhibitor and its expression was
 measured by RT-PCR. Cell viability and apoptotic cells were measured by CCK-8
 assay and flow cytometry analysis. The levels of pro-inflammatory factors
 (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1) were assessed by western blot and RT-PCR.
 Western blot was performed to detect the expression of the MEK/ERK
 pathway-related factors. LPS exposure reduced cell viability, increased
 apoptotic cells, and promoted the expression of pro-inflammatory factors in
 H9c2 cells. However, GEN pretreatment significantly reduced LPS-induced cell
 injury, as increased cell viability, reduced apoptotic cells, and inhibited
 the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. Moreover, we found that miR-145
 expression was down-regulated by LPS exposure but was up-regulated by GEN
 pretreatment. The protective effect of GEN on LPS-injured H9c2 cells was
 blocked by miR-145 inhibitor. In addition, GEN inhibited the MEK/ERK pathway
 through up-regulating miR-145. Our results suggested that GEN exerted a
 protective role in LPS-injured H9c2 cells. The GEN-associated regulation
 might be related to its regulation on miR-145 and the MEK/ERK signaling
 pathway.",
