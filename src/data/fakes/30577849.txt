    abstract "BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: Ras is a control switch of ERK1/2 pathway, and
 hyperactivation of Ras-ERK1/2 signaling appears frequently in human cancers.
 However, the molecular regulation following by Ras-ERK1/2 activation is still
 unclear. This work aimed to reveal whether Ras-ERK1/2 promoted the
 development of colorectal cancer via regulating H3K9ac. METHODS: A vector for
 expression of K-Ras mutated at G12 V and T35S was transfected into SW48
 cells, and the acetylation of H3K9 was measured by Western blot analysis. MTT
 assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation
 and RT-qPCR were performed to detect whether H3K9ac was contributed to
 K-Ras-mediated cell growth and migration. Furthermore, whether HDAC2 and PCAF
 involved in modification of H3K9ac following Ras-ERK1/2 activation were
 studied. RESULTS: K-Ras mutated at G12 V and T35S induced a significant
 activation of ERK1/2 signaling and a significant down-regulation of H3K9ac.
 Recovering H3K9 acetylation by using a mimicked H3K9ac expression vector
 attenuated the promoting effects of Ras-ERK1/2 on tumor cells growth and
 migration. Besides, H3K9ac can be deacetylated by HDAC2 and MDM2-depedent
 degradation of PCAF. CONCLUSION: H3K9ac was a specific target for Ras-ERK1/2
 signaling pathway. H3K9 acetylation can be modulated by HDAC2 and
 MDM2-depedent degradation of PCAF. The revealed regulation provides a better
 understanding of Ras-ERK1/2 signaling in tumorigenesis.",
