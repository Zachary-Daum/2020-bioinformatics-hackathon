    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common
 chronic degenerative diseases. Many studies have demonstrated the role of
 microRNAs (miRNAs) in OA; however, the role of miR-302b in OA remains
 elusive. The aim of this study was to identify the role of miR-302b in
 LPS-induced injury in chondrocytes. METHODS: Human OA chondrocytes (C28/12
 cell line) were transfected with miR-302b inhibitor and miR-302b mimic to
 investigate the effects of miR-302b expression on chondrocyte apoptosis and
 inflammation, and to identify the miR-302b target proteins. RESULTS: LPS
 treatment of chondrocytes significantly reduced cell viability and increased
 apoptotic rate. LPS treatment also increased the expression of inflammatory
 cytokines compared to control. miR-302b was up-regulated in LPS-induced
 chondrocytes. miR-302b was either suppressed or overexpressed in LPS-induced
 chondrocytes by transient transfection. miR-302b mimic transfection
 accelerated the effects of LPS on cell viability, apoptosis and inflammation.
 Of contrast, miR-302b inhibition represented a reverse effect. Dual
 luciferase activity demonstrated that Smad3 is a direct target for miR-302b
 and its expression was negatively regulated by miR-302b. In addition,
 miR-302b inhibition suppressed inflammation in LPS treated chondrocytes by
 up-regulating Smad3 expression. Moreover, LPS induced down-regulation of
 Notch and mTOR signaling pathway-related protein expressions, and miR-302b
 inhibition increased the expressions of Notch and mTOR signaling
 pathway-related proteins. We further found that miR-302b negatively regulated
 Notch2 levels through direct targeting its 3'UTR. CONCLUSIONS: These results
 suggest that miR-302b suppression may function as a protector in suppressing
 the inflammation during the development and progression of OA by
 up-regulating the target Smad3 expression.",
