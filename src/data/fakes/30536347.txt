    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Lower extremity arteriosclerosis is one of leading
 causes of death worldwide. Arteriosclerosis is closely related to
 microvascular endothelial cells. This study was aimed to explore the role of
 long non-coding RNA ROR in regulations of growth, migration, and angiogenesis
 of microvascular endothelial cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Angiogenesis was
 determined by the number of tube-like cells on a matrigel extracellular
 matrix. Cell viability, apoptosis, and migration were determined by CCK-8
 assay, PI/FITC-Annexin V staining method, and transwell assay, respectively.
 Relative RNA expression of ROR, miR-26, and angiogenesis-associated genes
 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The protein expression of apoptosis- and
 angiogenesis-associated genes, as well as main factors in NF-kappaB and
 JAK1/STAT3 pathways, were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: LncRNA ROR
 silence inhibited viability, migration, and angiogenesis of HMEC-1 cells but
 promoted apoptosis of them. miR-26 expression was promoted after knocking
 down ROR expression. miR-26 overexpression enhanced the inhibitory effects of
 ROR silence on growth, migration, and angiogenesis in HMEC-1 cells, whereas,
 miR-26 silence impaired the effects of ROR silence. Finally, we found that
 NF-kappaB and JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathways were inhibited by ROR
 down-regulation. Similarly, miR-26 overexpression enhanced the inhibitory
 effect of ROR down-regulation on the pathways and miR-26 inhibition abrogated
 it. CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulating lncRNA ROR inhibited growth, migration and
 angiogenesis of microvascular endothelial cells possibly through
 up-regulation of miR-26. During this process, the activations of NF-kappaB
 and JAK1/STAT3 pathways were inhibited after interaction of ROR and miR-26.",
