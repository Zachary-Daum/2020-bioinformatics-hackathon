    abstract "BACKGROUND: The high incidence and relapse make bladder cancer
 become a public health problem. Although the anti-tumor role of baicalein
 (BAI) in bladder cancer has been reported, the details of regulatory
 mechanism and the interaction between BAI and microRNAs (miRs) remain
 unclear. We aimed to explore the regulatory mechanisms of BAI in bladder
 cancer. METHODS: T24 cell viability after BAI treatments was measured by Cell
 Counting Kit-8 assay. Then, effects of BAI on proliferation, apoptosis,
 migration and expressions of proteins involved were assessed by BrdU
 incorporation assay, flow cytometry assay, Transwell cell migration assay and
 Western blot analysis, respectively. We subsequently testified the miR-106
 and p21 level using stem-loop RT-PCR. In addition, whether BAI affected T24
 cells through regulating miR-106 was verified. Double luciferase reporter
 assay was used to determine a target of miR-106. The involvements of the
 c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase
 kinase (MEK)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways were
 finally measured. RESULTS: First of all, we verified that BAI could repress
 proliferation and migration, and promote apoptosis. Then, we interestingly
 identified that miR-106 level was decreased by BAI stimulation. After that,
 miR-106 overexpression was found to significantly reverse the effects of BAI
 on proliferation, migration and apoptosis of T24 cells. p21 was a target of
 miR-106. Finally, phosphorylated levels of JNK, MEK and ERK were reduced by
 BAI, and those reductions were reversed by miR-106 overexpression.
 Furthermore, phosphorylated levels of JNK, MEK and ERK were reduced by p21
 upregulation. CONCLUSION: BAI suppressed proliferation and migration, and
 induced apoptosis of T24 cells through down-regulating miR-106, along with
 inhibition of the JNK and MEK/ERK pathways.",
