    abstract "Emodin is a natural product extracted from Rheum palmatum. There
 are few recent studies on emodin in the treatment of myocarditis. This study
 aimed to investigate the effect of emodin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
 inflammatory injury in cardiomyocytes. H9c2 cells were treated with 10 muM of
 LPS and different concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 muM) of emodin. The
 expression of miR-223 was changed by transient transfection. Thereafter, cell
 viability, apoptosis, the expression of CyclinD1 and Jnk-associated proteins,
 and the release of pro-inflammatory factors were assessed by cell Counting
 Kit-8, flow cytometry analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain
 reaction Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay respectively.
 The results showed that 20 muM of emodin significantly decreased H9c2 cells
 viability. LPS significantly damaged H9c2 cells, as cell viability was
 reduced, CyclinD1 was down-regulated, apoptosis was induced, the release of
 interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were
 increased, and the phosphorylation of Jnk and c-Jun were promoted. Emodin
 protected H9c2 cells against LPS-induced inflammatory injury. miR-223
 expression was significantly up-regulated by LPS exposure, while emodin
 lessened this up-regulation. LPS-injured H9c2 cells were attenuated by the
 overexpression of miR-223; emodin has protective actions on LPS-injured H9c2
 cells and targets. Besides, SP600125 (an inhibitor of Jnk) eliminated
 miR-223-modulated inflammatory injury in H9c2 cells. These data demonstrated
 that emodin could attenuate LPS-induced inflammatory injury and deactivate
 Jnk signaling pathway through down-regulation of miR-223.",
