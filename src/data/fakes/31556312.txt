    abstract "Sinomenine (Sino) is diffusely applied in heal rheumatoid
 arthritis and neuralgia. Howbeit, the activities of Sino in breast cancer
 cells remain confused. The research attempted to probe the anti-tumor
 function of Sino in breast cancer cells and divulge the feasible molecular
 mechanism. Sion at the 1-16 muM concentrations was exploited for the exposure
 of MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells, and cell growth, migration, invasion, cell
 cycle-relevant and apoptosis-correlative factors were estimated. Micro RNA
 (miR)-29 expression was evaluated via enforcing qRT-PCR, and the actions of
 miR-29 in MDA-MB-231 cells growth, migration and invasion were appraised
 after the overexpressed or suppressed vectors transfection. The functions of
 PDCD-4 in JNK and MEK/ERK pathways were estimated by employing western blot.
 We found that, Sino exposure impeded cell proliferation, provoked cell
 apoptosis and barricaded cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7
 cells. Enhancement of miR-29 was observed in Sino-managed cells, and miR-29
 overexpression further potentiated the activities of Sino in MDA-MB-231
 cells. Additionally, Sino remarkably enhanced PCDC-4 expression via adjusting
 miR-29 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Beyond that, overexpressed PCDC-4 obstructed JNK
 and MEK/ERK pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, the explorations
 unveiled that Sino restrained MDA-MB-231 cells proliferation, migration,
 invasion, and provoked apoptosis through modulation of miR-29/PDCD-4 axis.
 Highlight Sino inhibits MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells proliferation and provokes
 apoptosis; Sino restrains MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells migration and invasion;
 Sino ascends miR-29 expression in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells; Sino adjusts
 cell growth, migration and invasion via modulating miR-29; Sino up-regulates
 PDCD-4 expression through mediating miR-29; PDCD-4 obstructs JNK and MEK/ERK
 pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells.",
