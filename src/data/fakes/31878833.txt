    abstract "Background/Aims: Myocardial ischemia (MI) is a serious threat to
 human health. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role in many
 diseases including MI. The effect and mechanism of circDENND2A in MI have not
 been studied.Methods: We used oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment to
 simulate MI in vitro. We detected circDENND2A and microRNA (miR)-34a levels
 by RT-qPCR. The transfection process used INTERFER and jetPRIME. Cell growth
 indexes including viability, apoptosis, and migration were detected by CCK8,
 flow cytometry, and transwell assays, respectively. In addition, the Bax,
 Cleaved-Caspase-3, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and
 pathway-related protein levels were tested by Western blot.Results: OGD
 upregulated circDENND2A expression in H9c2 cells. Overexpression of
 circDENND2A enhanced cell viability and migration but declined apoptosis
 under OGD. Silenced circDENND 2A played the opposite effects. circDENND2A
 negatively regulated miR-34a. miR-34a overexpression weakened the protective
 effects of circDENND2A in OGD-injury. Moreover, we considered circDENND2A and
 miR-34a may work via beta-catenin and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways.Conclusion:
 circDENND2A overexpression enhanced OGD-inhibited cell viability and
 migration but declined OGD-promoted apoptosis by downregulating miR-34a and
 via beta-catenin and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways.",
