    abstract "Atherosclerosis is a common cardiovascular disorder and is
 characterized by damage of endothelial cells, cell inflammation,
 hyper-proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and the accumulation of
 extracellular lipids and fibrous tissues. In this study, we firstly examined
 the expression level of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, regulator of
 reprogramming (linc-ROR) in homocysteine (Hcy)-stimulated human aortic smooth
 muscle cells (HASMCs), and then looked into the potential molecular signaling
 axis of linc-ROR in regulating the proliferation and migration of HASMCs. Hcy
 promoted HASMC proliferation and up-regulated linc-ROR expression. Functional
 studies showed that linc-ROR exerted enhanced actions on the proliferation
 and migration of HASMCs. In addition, linc-ROR acted as a competing
 endogenous RNA for miR-195-5p and repressed the miR-195-5p expression in
 HASMCs. Linc-ROR was up-regulated the miR-195-3p was down-regulated in the
 plasma from CAD patients when compared to normal controls. Furthermore,
 fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) was identified as a target of miR-195-5p
 and was negatively regulated by miR-195-5p in HASMCs. The rescue experiments
 revealed that linc-ROR-mediated HASMC proliferation and migration may be via
 regulating miR-195-5p/FGF2 axis. Linc-ROR inhibition blocked the
 miR-195-5p/FGF2 signaling in Hcy-treated HASMCs, and this effect may also
 involve in the miR-195-5p/FGF2 axis. To summarize, the data of the present
 study identified the up-regulation of linc-ROR in Hcy-stimulated HASMCs, and
 further mechanistic functional studies revealed that linc-ROR promoted HASMC
 proliferation and migration via regulating miR-195-5p/FGF2 axis. The present
 study provided the novel actions of linc-ROR in regulating HASMC
 proliferation and migration, which may be related to the pathophysiology of
 atherosclerosis.",
