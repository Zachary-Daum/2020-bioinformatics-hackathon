    abstract "Bedsore is a familiar disease, which fearfully harms the health
 of the patients. We investigated the efficacy and mechanism of circular RNA
 circANKRD36 on HaCaT cell in inflammatory damage. CCK-8 and flow cytometry
 were respectively used to investigate the efficacies of lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS), circANKRD36, and microRNA (miR)-15 on cell viability and apoptosis.
 Moreover, circANKRD36 and miR-15 expression were changed by cell transfection
 and investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain
 reaction. Furthermore, the levels of Bax, pro caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3,
 interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and proteins of the pathway were investigated
 by Western blot. Otherwise, the levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 were investigated
 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was
 investigated by ROS assay. The relation between myeloid differentiation
 factor 88 (MyD88) and miR-15 was investigated by luciferase assay. LPS caused
 inflammatory damage and upregulated circANKRD36. circANKRD36 was silenced in
 cells and si-circANKRD36 remitted inflammatory damage. Furthermore,
 si-circANKRD36 negatively regulated miR-15 and miR-15 inhibitor could reverse
 the efficacies of si-circANKRD36. Besides, si-circANKRD36 restrained the
 NF-kappaB pathway by upregulating miR-15. Finally, MyD88 was authenticated as
 a target of miR-15. circANKRD36 remitted cell inflammatory damage
 upregulating miR-15/MyD88 via the NF-kappaB pathway in HaCaT cells.",
