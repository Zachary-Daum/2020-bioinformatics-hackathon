    abstract "Gastric carcinoma (GC) remains the second leading cause of
 cancer-related deaths worldwide. Good biomarkers are of paramount importance
 for GC therapy. This study aimed to assess the role of long noncoding RNA
 (lncRNA) CAT104 in GC. We found that CAT104 was highly expressed in human GC
 NCI-N87, SGC7901, BGC823, BGC803, and AGS cells. Suppression of CAT104
 decreased NCI-N87 cell viability, migration, and invasion, but promoted
 apoptosis. CAT104 knockdown enhanced the expression of microRNA-381 (miR-381)
 expression in NCI-N87 cells. miR-381 participated in the regulatory effects
 of CAT104 on NCI-N87 cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Zinc
 finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was identified as a direct target of
 miR-381. Overexpression of ZEB1 reversed the miR-381 mimic-induced cell
 viability, migration, and invasion inhibition. Suppression of ZEB1 reversed
 the miR-381 inhibitor-induced activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
 pathway and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways in NCI-N87 cells. In
 conclusion, CAT104 might function as an oncogenic factor in GC cells via
 regulating the expression of miR-381 and ZEB1.",
