    abstract "H3 modification is related to a wide range of tumors, including
 liver cancer. The Ras passageway is actuated in human diseases. Thus, we
 investigated the roles of Ras in liver cancer cells via acetylation of H3K56.
 Ras-carrying G12V and Y40C site mutation was transfected into liver cancer
 cell lines SNU-475 and SK-Hep-1. Acetylation of H3K56 and
 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and
 Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) was tested via western blot. Cell
 activity, colonies, and migration were tested via Cell Counting Kit-8,
 soft-agar colony formation, and Transwell experiment, respectively. Sirtuin 6
 (SIRT6) and PCAF were tested via quantitative reverse transcription
 polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was
 employed to test the relationship between Ras and downstream elements. Flow
 cytometry was employed to test cell cycle series. We found that
 Ras(G12V/Y40C) transfection reduced the acetylation of H3K56 and activated
 phosphorylation of protein kinase B. H3K56Q (H3K56ac overexpression)
 suppressed cell activity, colonies, and migration. H3K56ac changed Ras
 downstream factors expression. Ras(G12V/Y40C) bound to Ras-PI3K downstream
 elements' promoters. SIRT6 silencing raised H3K56ac and suppressed cell
 activity, migration and S phage cell percentage. SIRT6 silence transformed
 expression of downstream elements. PCAF and H3K56ac demonstrated the close
 current while MDM2 was conversed. In summary, the Ras-PI3K passageway
 promoted cell growth and metastasis via decreasing H3K56ac, in which
 MDM2-mediated PCAF was involved.",
