    abstract "This study aimed to elucidate the potential role of long
 non-coding RNA PlncRNA-1 in the septic acute kidney injury (AKI). The
 expression of PlncRNA-1 in the serum of patients with septic AKI patient was
 detected. We then established lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic AKI
 model in NRK-52E cells to investigate the effects of the overexpression of
 PlncRNA-1 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy. In addition, the
 regulatory relationship between PlncRNA-1 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) was
 explored to further elucidate the regulatory mechanism of PlncRNA-1 in septic
 AKI. PlncRNA-1 is downregulated in the serum of patients with septic AKI and
 in LPS-induced septic AKI cells. The overexpression of PlncRNA-1 considerably
 increases proliferation and inhibits apoptosis and autophagy of LPS-induced
 septic AKI cells. In addition, PlncRNA-1 can promote BCL2 expression, and the
 overexpression of BCL2 enhances proliferation and inhibits apoptosis and
 autophagy of LPS-induced septic AKI cells. Our findings reveal that the
 overexpression of PlncRNA-1 may promote cell proliferation and inhibit
 apoptosis and autophagy in septic AKI by regulating BCL2 expression.
 PlncRNA-1 may serve as a potential biomarker or target for the diagnosis and
 treatment of septic AKI.",
