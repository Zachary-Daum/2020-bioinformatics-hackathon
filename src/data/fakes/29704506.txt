    abstract "BACKGROUND: Resveratrol (RSV), an edible polyphenolic
 phytoalexin, plays an important role in ameliorating inflammation, including
 skin inflammation after burn injury. However, the specific molecular
 mechanism underlying its anti-inflammation effect is still unclear. Herein,
 the effect and the mechanism underlying the protection of HaCaT cells by RSV
 against inflammation were examined. METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
 inflammation and the cytoprotection of RSV were evaluated by detecting
 viability, apoptosis, expressions of apoptosis-associated proteins and the
 productions of pro-inflammatory factors by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometer,
 Western blot, and qRT-PCR. miR-17 expression in RSV-treated HaCaT cells was
 determined by qRT-PCR. The role of miR-17 in protective effect of RSV was
 investigated after altering its expression using transfection assay. The main
 ingredients in PTEN/PI3K/AKT and mTOR pathways were quantified by Western
 blot. RESULTS: LPS-induced HaCaT cell injury was inhibited by RSV
 administration. RSV promoted viability, inhibited apoptotic cell rate,
 increased Bcl-2 expression, decreased Bax, cleaved-Caspase-3, and
 cleaved-Caspase-9 expressions. RSV also inhibited inflammation injury of
 HaCaT cells by reducing productions of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha. miR-17 was
 up-regulated in LPS and RSV-co-treated cells. The protective effect of RSV
 might contribute to overexpression of miR-17. In the mechanism study,
 RSV-miR-17 axis was found to activate PTEN/PI3K/AKT and mTOR pathways in
 LPS-treated cells. CONCLUSION: RSV alleviated LPS-induced injury in human
 keratinocyte cell line HaCaT through activations of PTEN/PI3K/AKT and mTOR
 pathways, which were modulated by miR-17.",
