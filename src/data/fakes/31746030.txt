    abstract "Diabetes, is the eighth cause of death worldwide, is a kind of
 metabolic disease. We planned to study the potentials of the angelica
 polysaccharide (AP) in MIN6 cell line. Cells were induced with tumor necrosis
 factor alpha (TNF-alpha) dilution or APsolutions, and transfected with
 microRNA-143 (miR-143) as well as the corresponding negative control (NC).
 Viability was assessed via CCK-8, while the apoptosis rate was tested by the
 Annexin V-FITC/PI as well as flow cytometer. The insulin, miR-143 and
 relative proteins and the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were
 individually determined via GSIS assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot. TNF-alpha
 induced inhibition of viability and secretion of insulin, but promotion of
 apoptosis and iNOS, as well as NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK cascades on MIN6 cell
 line. AP released TNF-alpha-resulted damage by up-regulating miR-143. miR-143
 inhibitor partly abolished the influence of AP on MIN6 cells. AP released
 TNF-alpha-induced injury by promoting miR-143 through blocking NF-kappaB and
 p38 MAPK in the MIN6 cells.",
