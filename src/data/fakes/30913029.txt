    abstract "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women
 worldwide. Tripterine is an important active component isolated from
 Triperygium wilfordii Hook F. This study investigated the effects of
 tripterine on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and
 apoptosis, as well as microRNA-15a (miR-15a) expression. Quantitative reverse
 transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure
 the expression of miR-15a. Cell transfection was conducted to change the
 expression of miR-15a. Viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and
 apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed using the cell counting kit-8
 (CCK-8) assay, BrdU incorporation assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis
 detection kit and two-chamber Transwell assay, respectively. Expression of
 key factors involving in cell proliferation, migration, invasion and
 apoptosis, as well as the PI3K/AKT and JNK pathways, were evaluated using
 Western blotting. We found that tripterine inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell
 viability, proliferation, migration and invasion, but induced cell apoptosis.
 Moreover, tripterine up-regulated the expression of miR-15a in a
 concentration-dependent manner and miR-15a participated in the effects of
 tripterine on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and
 apoptosis. In addition, tripterine inactivated PI3K/AKT and JNK pathways in
 MDA-MB-231 cells by up-regulating miR-15a. In conclusion, tripterine
 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer MDA-MB-231
 cells by up-regulating miR-15a and inactivating PI3K/AKT and JNK pathways.",
