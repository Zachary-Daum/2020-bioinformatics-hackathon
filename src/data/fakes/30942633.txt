    abstract "Osteoblast has been found to exert indispensable functions
 during fracture healing. This study aimed to investigate the effects of
 kaempferol, a natural flavonoid compound, on osteoblast proliferation,
 migration and differentiation, as well as possible molecular mechanisms.
 qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression level of microRNA-101
 (miR-101). Cell viability and migration were respectively assessed using cell
 counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and two-chamber migration assay. Relative
 alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was evaluated using p-nitrophenyl
 phosphate (pNPP) as substrate. Western blotting was used to detect the
 protein expression levels of key molecules involved in cell proliferation,
 migration, differentiation, and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Kaempferol
 treatment significantly promoted MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation, migration, and
 differentiation. Mechanistically, kaempferol notably enhanced the expression
 level of miR-101 in MC3T3-E1 cells. Knockdown of miR-101 obviously weakened
 the promoting effects of kaempferol on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation,
 migration, and differentiation. In addition, kaempferol remarkably activated
 Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells via up-regulating miR-101. This
 research further confirmed the promoting effects of kaempferol on osteoblast
 proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The up-regulation of miR-101
 and activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway caused by kaempferol play critical
 roles in the promoting effects of kaempferol on osteoblast proliferation,
 migration, and differentiation.",
