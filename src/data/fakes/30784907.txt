    abstract "Background Prostate cancer is an extremely common disease in
 males, and the mortality of prostate cancer has been rising year by year.
 Sinomenine has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor effect on various cancers,
 but the function of Sinomenine in prostate cancer remains unclear. The study
 aimed to explore the effect of Sinomenine on proliferation, apoptosis,
 migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Methods PC3 cells were
 stimulated by different concentrations of Sinomenine, then cell
 proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were examined by CCK-8,
 BrdU, Transwell and flow cytometry, respectively. Subsequently, miR-23a mimic
 and miR-23a inhibitor were transfected into PC3 and LNCaP cells, cell
 proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were reassessed in these
 transfected cells. The related factors of cell cycle, apoptosis, metastasis
 and PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signal pathways were measured by western blot.
 Results Sinomenine significantly suppressed cell proliferation, promoted
 apoptosis and inhibited migration and invasion, as well as down-regulated
 Cyclin D1, CDK4, Bcl-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, Vimentin protein levels and
 up-regulated p16 and Bax protein levels in PC3 cells. Additionally,
 Sinomenine decreased the expression level of miR-23a, and overexpression of
 miR-23a reversed the effects of Sinomenine on cell proliferation, apoptosis,
 migration and invasion in PC3 and LNCaP cells. Further, Sinomenine
 inactivated PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signal pathways by regulation of miR-23a.
 Conclusions The data suggested that Sinomenine could suppress cell
 proliferation, migration, invasion, and promote apoptosis of prostate cancer
 cells through regulation of miR-23a. These findings might provide a possible
 strategy for the clinical treatment of prostate cancer.",
