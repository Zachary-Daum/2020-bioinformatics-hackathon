    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acute myocardial infarction is a serious
 disease with high morbidity and mortality. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been
 proved to play an important role in modulating myocardial ischemia and
 reperfusion injury. Hence, in this study, we constructed H9c2 cell model to
 elucidate the roles of microRNA-486 (miR-486) in preventing hypoxia-induced
 damage in H9c2 cells. METHODS: H9c2 cells were cultured in hypoxic incubator
 with 1% O2 to simulate hypoxia and/or transfected with miR-486 mimic,
 scramble, anti-miR-486, si-N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) and
 their corresponding negative controls (NC). Effects of miR-486 and/or NDRG2
 dysregulation on hypoxia-induced myocardial injury in H9c2 cells were
 investigated by evaluating cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis
 using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell assay, flow cytometry,
 respectively. The proteins expression and RNA expression were detected by
 western blot and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),
 respectively. RESULTS: Hypoxia treatment induced damage in H9c2 cells by
 decreasing cell viability, migration and invasion and increasing cell
 apoptosis. Moreover, hypoxia inhibited the expression of miR-486 in H9c2
 cells. Overexpression of miR-486 alleviated hypoxia-induced myocardial injury
 in H9c2 cells, while suppression of miR-486 further aggravated
 hypoxia-induced injury. Furthermore, NDRG2 expression was negatively
 regulated by miR-486, and NDRG2 was confirmed as a target of miR-486.
 Knockdown of NDRG2 alleviated the effects of miR-486 suppression on
 hypoxia-induced myocardial injury. Besides, knockdown of NDRG2 markedly
 inhibited the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) /c-jun and nuclear
 factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways in hypoxia-induced H9c2 cells.
 CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that miR-486 may alleviate hypoxia-induced
 myocardial injury possibly by targeting NDRG2 to inactivate JNK/c-jun and
 NF-kappaB signaling pathways. miR-486 may be a potential target for treating
 ischemic myocardial injury following acute myocardial infarction.",
