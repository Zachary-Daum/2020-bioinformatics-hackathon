    abstract "BACKGROUND: Swainsonine is a natural indolizidine alkaloid, its
 anti-tumor activity has been widely reported in varied cancers. This study
 aimed to investigate whether Swainsonine exerted anti-tumor impact on glioma
 cells, likewise uncovered the relative molecular mechanisms. METHODS: After
 administration with diverse concentrations of Swainsonine, cell growth,
 migration and invasion in U251 and LN444 cells were appraised by the
 common-used CCK-8, BrdU, flow cytometry and Transwell assays. MiR-92a mimic,
 inhibitor and the correlative NC were transfected into U251 and LN444 cells,
 and assessment of miR-92a expression was by utilizing qRT-PCR. Functions of
 miR-92a in above-mentioned cell biological processes were analyzed again in
 Swainsonine-treated cells. The momentous proteins of cell cycle, apoptosis
 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were ultimately examined by western blot. RESULTS:
 Swainsonine significantly hindered cell proliferation through decreasing cell
 viability, declining the percentage of BrdU cells, down-regulating CyclinD1
 and up-regulating p16 expression. Enhancement of percentage of apoptotic
 cells was presented in Swainsonine-treated cells via activating
 cleaved-Caspase-3 and cleaved-Caspase-9. Additionally, Swainsonine impeded
 the abilities of migration and invasion by decreasing MMP-2, MMP-9, Vimentin
 and E-cadherin. Repression of miR-92a was observed in Swainsonine-treated
 cells, and miR-92a overexpression overturned the anti-tumor activity of
 Swainsonine in glioma cells. Finally, western blot assay displayed that
 Swainsonine hindered PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway via regulating miR-92a.
 CONCLUSIONS: These discoveries corroborated that Swainsonine exerted
 anti-tumor impacts on glioma cells via repression of miR-92a, and
 inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",
