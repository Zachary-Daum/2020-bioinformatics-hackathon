    abstract "Lymphoma is a common cause of cancer worldwide with an
 increasing incidence in recent years. A large number of studies have shown
 that HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) exerts as an oncogene
 in various neoplasms. However, the function of HOTAIR in lymphoma still
 remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the function of
 HOTAIR in lymphoma and its underlying mechanisms. The expressions of HOTAIR,
 miR-148b, and BMI1 in lymphoma samples and cells (AHH-1, Raji, and U937) were
 quantified by quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell
 viability was measured by trypan blue assay. The efficiency of transfection
 was verified by qRT-PCR or Western blot analysis. Apoptotic cells and cell
 cycle progression were both detected by flow cytometry assay. Furthermore,
 Western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression of
 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated
 kinase (ERK) pathway-related core factors. We found that HOTAIR knockdown
 reduced cell viability but increased apoptotic cells and inhibited cell cycle
 progression in Raji and U937 cells. miR-148b expression was upregulated by
 HOTAIR inhibition. Meanwhile, miR-148b inhibitor abolished the modulation of
 HOTAIR silence on cell growth, as evidenced by increased cell viability,
 reduced apoptotic cells, and decreased the rate of G1 phase cells.
 Furthermore, miR-148b negatively regulated the expression of BMI1 by
 targeting its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), and BMI1 overexpression
 blocked the effect of miR-148b mimic on cell growth. In addition, BMI1
 promoted the activation of MAPK and ERK in Raji and U937 cells. In
 conclusion, the present study demonstrated that HOTAIR knockdown inhibited
 the cell growth and promoted apoptosis of lymphoma cells via upregulation of
 miR-148b and miR-148b further regulated the expression of BMI1 via MAPK and
 ERK signaling pathways.",
