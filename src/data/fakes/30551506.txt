    abstract "Thyroid cancer (TC) is a familiar cancer, which accounts for
 approximately 1% of the malignant tumors of all cancers worldwide. Recently,
 icariin (ICA) has been reported to play an anti-tumor role in different
 cancers. The study aimed to investigate the effect of ICA on TC cells to
 uncover the regulatory mechanism. The different concentrations of ICA were
 stimulated SW579 and TPC1 cells, and cell viability, apoptosis, migration,
 invasion and main factors of these processes were detected by CCK-8, flow
 cytometry, Transwell and western blot. The expression of miR-625-3p in TC
 tissues or in ICA-treated cells was examined by qRT-PCR. MiR-625-3p mimic and
 the negative control were transfected into SW579 and TPC1 cells to
 investigate the effect of miR-625-3p on TC. Finally, the signaling pathways
 of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK were examined by western blot. ICA significantly
 suppressed cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis by
 regulating Bcl-2, Bax and cleaced-Caspase-3/-9 expression in SW579 and TPC1
 cells (p<0.001). Moreover, ICA inhibited cell migration and invasion by
 down-regulating MMP-9 and Vimentin in SW579 and TPC1 cells (p<0.01 or
 p<0.001). The expression level of miR-625-3p was decreased by ICA, and
 miR-625-3p overexpression reversed the anti-tumor effect of ICA on SW579 and
 TPC1 cells (p<0.05, p<0.01 or p<0.001). Furthermore, ICA inactivated PI3K/AKT
 and MEK/ERK signaling pathways by mediating miR-625-3p in SW579 and TPC1
 cells. ICA exerted anti-tumor effect by inhibiting cell proliferation,
 migration and invasion by down-regulating miR-625-3p in TC cells.",
