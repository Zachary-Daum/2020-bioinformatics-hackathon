    abstract "Baicalin (BAI), a sort of flavonoid monomer, acquires from
 Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, which was forcefully reported in diversified
 ailments due to the pleiotropic properties. But, the functions of BAI in
 osteoblast differentiation have not been addressed. The intentions of this
 study are to attest the influences of BAI in the differentiation of
 osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 cells or rat primary osteoblasts were exposed to BAI,
 and then cell viability, ALP activity, mineralization process, and Runx2 and
 Ocn expression were appraised through implementing CCK-8, p-nitrophenyl
 phosphate (pNPP), Alizarin red staining, western blot, and RT-qPCR assays.
 The microRNA-217 (miR-217) expression was evaluated in MC3T3-E1 cells or rat
 primary osteoblasts after BAI disposition; meanwhile, the functions of
 miR-217 in BAI-administrated MC3T3-E1 cells were estimated after miR-217
 inhibitor transfection. The impacts of BAI and miR-217 inhibition on
 Wnt/beta-catenin and MEK/ERK pathways were probed to verify the involvements
 in BAI-regulated the differentiation of osteoblasts. BAI accelerated cell
 viability, osteoblast activity, and Runx2 and Ocn expression in MC3T3-E1
 cells or rat primary osteoblasts, and the phenomena were mediated via
 activations of Wnt/beta-catenin and MEK/ERK pathways. Elevation of miR-217
 was observed in BAI-disposed MC3T3-E1 cells or rat primary osteoblasts, and
 miR-217 repression annulled the functions of BAI in MC3T3-E1 cell viability
 and differentiation. Additionally, the activations of Wnt/beta-catenin and
 MEK/ERK pathways evoked by BAI were both restrained by repression of miR-217.
 These explorations uncovered that BAI augmented the differentiation of
 osteoblasts via activations of Wnt/beta-catenin and MEK/ERK pathways by
 ascending miR-217 expression.",
