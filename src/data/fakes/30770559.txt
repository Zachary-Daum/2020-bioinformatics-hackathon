    abstract "Inadequate oxygen supply is probably one of the most important
 pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiomyocyte damage in ischemic heart
 disease. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP, also known as ligustrazine) is the main
 active ingredient isolated from the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. A
 previous study reported that the TMP could exert cardioprotective activity.
 This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of the protective effects
 of TMP on cardiomyocyte damage caused by hypoxia. The viability and apoptosis
 of cardiomyocytes H9c2 were detected using cell counting kit-8 assay and
 annexin V-FITC/PI staining, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription
 polymerase chain reaction was conducted to measure the expression level of
 microRNA-449a (miR-449a). Cell transfection was performed to upregulate the
 expression level of miR-449a or downregulate the expression level of sirtuin
 1 (Sirt1). The protein expression levels of Sirt1 and key factors involved in
 cell apoptosis and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase 3 (PI3K/AKT)
 pathway were evaluated using western blot analysis. We found that the hypoxia
 incubation inhibited H9c2 viability, induced cell apoptosis, and inactivated
 the PI3K/AKT pathway. TMP treatment partially relieved the hypoxia-caused
 H9c2 cell viability loss and apoptosis, as well as reversed the
 hypoxia-caused inactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, TMP partially
 alleviated the upregulation of miR-449a in H9c2 cells caused by hypoxia.
 Overexpression of miR-449a weakened the effects of TMP on hypoxia-treated
 H9c2 cells. Furthermore, Sirt1 was a target gene of miR-449a. Knockdown of
 Sirt1 also weakened the effects of TMP on hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells. In
 conclusion, TMP partially relieved hypoxia-caused cardiomyocytes H9c2
 viability loss and apoptosis at least through downregulating miR-499a,
 upregulating Sirt1, and then activating the PI3K/AKT pathway.",
