    abstract "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been regarded as important regulators in
 different pathological processes of cells. Abnormal expression of miRNAs is
 frequently associated with cell proliferation, metastasis and apoptosis in
 various cancers. This study aimed to explore the effect of miR-146-5p on cell
 growth, metastasis and its mechanism in lung cancer cells. The expressions of
 miR-146-5p and claudin-12 in A549 and WI-38 cells were altered by transient
 transfection. Cisplatin was used to develop cells for regulation of cisplatin
 sensitivity. Cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were analyzed
 by CCK-8, Transwell and flow cytometry assays. The protein expressions of
 Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT/MAPK pathway-related factors were detected.
 miR-146-5p suppression inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion but
 promoted apoptosis in A549 cells. Moreover, overexpression of miR-146-5p
 reduced the sensitivity of A549 cells and WI-38 cells to cisplatin. In
 addition, claudin-12 was a direct target of miR-146-5p and was negatively
 regulated by miR-146-5p. Claudin-12 silence significantly reversed miR-146-5p
 suppression-mediated anti-tumor effects in A549 cells. Furthermore,
 miR-146-5p overexpression activated Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT/MAPK signal
 pathways via down-regulation of claudin-12. The results indicated that
 miR-146-5p promoted cell viability, migration and invasion, inhibited
 apoptosis and activated Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT/MAPK signal pathways by
 regulating claudin-12 expression in lung cancer cells.",
