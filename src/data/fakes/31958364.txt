    abstract "BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma cancer is a malignant tumor with poor
 outcome. Activation of STAT3 is closely related with tumor development. We
 intended to study the effects of JMJD6 on phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705
 site. METHODS: Osteosarcoma cancer cell lines (Saos-2, MG-63, and HOS) and
 clinical specimens were obtained. Interference RNA or JMJD6 mimic was
 transfected into the cells to silence or mimic JMJD6. Immunoprecipitation
 assay and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull down was implemented to
 investigate whether JMJD6 is associated with STAT3. STAT3-null HOS cells were
 simultaneously transfected with the plasmids bearing STAT3(WT) or
 STAT3(Y705F) and EGFP-tagged LC3 plasmids. Recombinant full-length JMJD6
 protein was subjected to in vitro kinase activity assay for testing its
 ability to phosphorylate STAT3. The severity of autophagy was indicated by
 the number of autophagosomes, expression of EGFP-LC3, ratio of LC3-II to
 LC3-I, degradation percentage of long-lived proteins and expression of
 autophagy associated gene (ATG). RESULTS: JMJD6 modulated the phosphorylation
 of STAT3 at Y705 site in osteosarcoma cells. Results from immunoprecipitation
 and GST pull down assays showed that JMJD6 associated with STAT3 in
 osteosarcoma cells. JMJD6 silence impeded the formation of autophagosomes,
 inhibited the accumulation of EGFP-LC3, decreased the ratio of LC3-II to
 LC3-I, blocked the degradation of long-lived proteins, and repressed the
 expression of ATG. JMJD6-induced autophagy was impaired by STAT3(Y705F) which
 was not phosphorylated by JMJD6. The JMJD6-STAT3(Y705ph) axis was implicated
 in the transcriptional regulation of ATG. CONCLUSION: JMJD6 was included in
 regulating the phosphorylation of STAT3(Y705) and promoted autophagy of
 osteosarcoma cells through its kinase activity.",
