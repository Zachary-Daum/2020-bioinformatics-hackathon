    abstract "BACKGROUND: Some circular RNAs (circRNAs) are reported to attend
 to the pathogenesis of pneumonia. This study tested the impact of circRNA
 ankyrin repeat domain 36 (circANKRD36) on human embryonic lung fibroblast
 MRC-5 cell injury irritated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: After LPS
 irritation, viability, apoptosis, ROS, protein, and cytokines, along with
 circANKRD36 were tested by CCK-8, Annexin V-FITC, DCFH-DA, and ELISA or
 Western blot. si-circANKRD36 and microRNA-31-3p/5p (miR-31-3p/5p) inhibitor
 were applied to silence circANKRD36 and miR-31-3p/5p. miR-31-3p/5p mimic was
 utilized to upregulate miR-31-3p/5p. RT-qPCR was used to detect miRNAs. The
 relationship between miRNAs and MyD88 or IL-34 was analyzed by luciferase
 activity reporter assay. RESULTS: LPS aroused a decrease in viability,
 increases in apoptosis, ROS, and IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha, along with
 circANKRD36, and activation of NF-kappaB pathway. Silencing circANKRD36
 weakened the above-mentioned influences of LPS. Moreover, silencing
 circANKRD36 hoisted miR-31-3p expression. Silencing miR-31-3p mitigated the
 impacts of circANKRD36 silence on LPS-irritated MRC-5 cells. Besides, MyD88
 was a downstream target of miR-31-3p, and 3'UTR of IL-34 mRNA was targeted by
 miR-31-5p. LPS induced the accumulation of MyD88. Silencing MyD88 was
 constructive to maintain cell viability, retard apoptosis and inhibit adverse
 oxidation and inflammation. CONCLUSION: This research verified that silencing
 circANKRD36 could weaken LPS-irritated MRC-5 cell injury via regulating
 miR-31/MyD88-mediated repression of NF-kappaB pathway.",
