    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIM: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a catastrophic
 disease. Emodin possesses biological properties in protecting against some
 diseases. Our study investigated to explore the effects of emodin on
 hypoxia-stimulated cardiomyocytes, which mimicked CHD in vitro. METHODS: H9c2
 cells were stimulated with hypoxia and then the cells were treated with or
 without emodin, and/or transfected with miR-26a mimic, pcDNA-survivin and
 their corresponding negative control (NC). Cell viability and cell apoptosis
 were detected by Cell Counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively.
 In addition, the expression of apoptotic proteins, Janus kinase 1
 (JNK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway
 factors, and survivin were evaluated by using Western blot analysis. The
 expression of miR-26a was analyzed by quantitative real time polymerase chain
 reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, the target of miR-26a was verified by using a
 luciferase report assay. RESULTS: Hypoxia significantly decreased cell
 viability and increased cell apoptosis, and the accumulated levels of cleaved
 caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-9 were upregulated by hypoxia compared with the
 control. However, emodin administration led to the opposite result. A further
 result showed that emodin increased the phosphorylation of JNK/STAT3
 pathway-related proteins and the pathway inhibitor AG490 impaired the
 protective effects of emodin on hypoxia-induced injury. In addition, emodin
 negatively regulated the miR-26a expression, and overexpression of miR-26a
 enhanced cell apoptosis and upregulated the expression of cleaved-caspase-3
 and cleaved-caspase-9 compared with the NC. Moreover, emodin statistically
 upregulated the expression of survivin, and overexpression of miR-26a
 decreased the expression of survivin. The luciferase of miR-26a
 overexpression was decreased in the wild type of the survivin group.
 CONCLUSION: Emodin protects hypoxia-induced cell injury as evidenced by
 increasing cell viability and decreasing apoptosis through downregulation of
 miR-26a as well as activation of the JNK/STAT3 pathway.",
