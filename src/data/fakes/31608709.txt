    abstract "Background: Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) is a promising
 therapeutic drug in inflammation-related injuries, nevertheless the mechanism
 of LBP's action is still elusive. The study is to explore the effect of LBP
 on IL-1beta-evoked ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury. Methods: ATDC5 cells were
 administrated with 10 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-1beta to establish an in vitro
 model of cartilage damage. After management, cell viability was tested
 through CCK8 assay. The pro-inflammatory cytokines and cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2
 were assessed through ELISA, western blot and qRT-PCR. MiR-124 expression in
 ATDC5 cells was silenced by transfecting with miR-124 inhibitor, and the
 pro-inflammatory cytokines and Cox-2 were re-assessed. NF-kappaB and JNK
 pathways were measured through western blot. Results: IL-1beta stimulation
 accelerated the release of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, elevated Cox-2
 expression. LBP significantly eased IL-1beta-induced inflammation. MiR-124
 expression was observed to enhance by LBP, and the impacts of LBP on ATDC5
 cells were lightened via transfection with miR-124 inhibitor. NF-kappaB and
 JNK pathways were activated after IL-1beta stimulation, nevertheless were
 inactivated by LBP administration. Besides, LBP-evoked the repression of
 NF-kappaB and JNK pathways were overturned by miR-124 inhibitor. Conclusions:
 Our study suggests that LBP protects ATDC5 cells from IL-1beta-evoked injury
 through up-regulating miR-124 via blocking NF-kappaB and JNK pathways.",
