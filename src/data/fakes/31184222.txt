    abstract "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that seriously
 harms human health. Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) can be used in various
 diseases. We explored consequents of NGR1 on tumour necrosis factor
 (TNF)-alpha-stimulated Min6 and rat primary islets beta cells. The results
 were that TNF-alpha significantly cut down cell activity, raised cell
 apoptosis and iNOS expression and decreased insulin secretion in Min6 and rat
 primary islets beta cells. NGR1 alleviated TNF-alpha-treated cell
 dysfunctions. In addition, miR-29a was positively regulated by NGR1 in
 TNF-alpha-treated Min6 and rat primary islets beta cells. miR-29a knockdown
 damaged protection roles of NGR1 through cutting down cell activity and
 insulin secretion, raising apoptosis and iNOS in TNF-alpha-treated Min6 and
 rat primary islets beta cells. The phosphorylation of Wnt3a, beta-catenin and
 the rate of p/t-AKT/PI3K was all increased, while p/t-GSK3beta was decreased
 by the administration with NGR1. In conclusion, NGR1 alleviated
 TNF-alpha-stimulated Min6 and rat primary islets beta cells apoptosis and
 worn roles via positively regulating miR-29a. This process might be through
 actuation of Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta signal ways.",
