    abstract "BACKGROUND: Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is the main saponin
 isolated from the roots of Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen (Araliaceae).
 This study explored the protective effects of NGR1 on human renal proximal
 tubular epithelial cell inflammatory damage caused by lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS), as well as possible internal molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Cell
 viability and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI
 Apoptosis Detection kit, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level
 was tested using DCFH-DA staining. qRT-PCR was used to measure microRNA-26a
 (miR-26a), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha
 (TNF-alpha) expressions. miRNA transfection was conducted to knock down
 miR-26a. The protein expression levels of key molecules related to cell
 apoptosis, inflammatory response and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)
 pathway were detected using western blotting. RESULTS: LPS stimulation caused
 human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell viability reduction, apoptosis
 and inflammatory cytokines expression. NGR1 treatment protected human renal
 proximal tubular epithelial cells from LPS-caused viability reduction, ROS
 level elevation, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines expression.
 Mechanistically, NGR1 enhanced miR-26a expression in LPS-treated human renal
 proximal tubular epithelial cells. Knockdown of miR-26a reversed the
 protective effect of NGR1 on LPS-treated cells. Besides, NGR1 inactivated
 NF-kappaB pathway in LPS-treated human renal proximal tubular epithelial
 cells via up-regulating miR-26a. CONCLUSION: NGR1 protected human renal
 proximal tubular epithelial cells from LPS-caused inflammatory damage at
 least partially via up-regulating miR-26a and then inactivating NF-kappaB
 pathway.",
