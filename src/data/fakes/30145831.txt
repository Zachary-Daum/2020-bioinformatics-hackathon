    abstract "Osteoarthritis is the most frequent chronic bone-joint disease
 in middle-aged and older people worldwide. This study investigated the
 effects of long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma
 transcript 1 (MALAT1) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine chondrogenic
 ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed
 using cell counting kit-8 assay and annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) staining,
 respectively. The expression levels of interleukin-1beta (IL)-1beta, IL-6,
 IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), MALAT1, and microRNA-19b
 (miR)-19b were measured using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase
 chain reaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to detect the
 concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in culture supernatant
 of ATDC5 cells. Expressions of key factors involved in cell apoptosis,
 proinflammatory response, Wnt/beta-catenin, and nuclear factor kappaB
 (NF-kappaB) pathways were analyzed using Western blot analysis. We found that
 LPS treatment remarkably induced ATDC5 cell apoptosis and inflammatory
 injury. MALAT1 was upregulated in LPS-stimulated ATDC5 cells. Overexpression
 of MALAT1 significantly reversed the LPS-induced ATDC5 cell inflammatory
 injury, while suppression of MALAT1 had opposite effects. Further results
 showed that MALAT1 positively regulated the expression of miR-19b in ATDC5
 cells. Knockdown of miR-19b reversed the protective effect of MALAT1 on
 LPS-induced ATDC5 cells. In addition, MALAT1 reduced LPS-induced
 Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways activation in ATDC5 cells by
 upregulating miR-19. To conclude, our research verified that MALAT1
 alleviated LPS-induced ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury by upregulating miR-19b
 and inactivating Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways. This finding will
 be helpful for further understanding the critical roles of MALAT1 and miR-19b
 in osteoarthritis and may provide possible targets for osteoarthritis
 diagnosis and treatment.",
