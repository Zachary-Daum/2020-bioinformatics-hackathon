    abstract "TUG1 has been reported to play an important role in various
 cancer types. However, the study about the function of lncRNA TUG1 in
 myocardial infarction is limited. This study was aimed to investigate the
 role of TUG1 in H9c2 cell injury induced by hypoxia and explore its possible
 molecular mechanism. The proliferation assay, migration assay, invasion
 assay, and apoptosis assay were performed. RT-PCR was used to determine the
 relative RNA expression of TUG1, miR-124 and Hic-5. Western blotting was used
 to detect the expression levels of apoptotic proteins, Hic-5, Sp1, and
 Survivin. Hypoxia could significantly decrease cell proliferation, migration
 and invasion and increase H9c2 cell apoptosis. Knock-down of TUG1 promoted
 the cell damage induced by hypoxia. miR-124 was the direct target of TUG1 and
 down-regulated by TUG1. TUG1 silence aggravated hypoxia injury by
 up-regulating miR-124. In addition, Hic-5 was the target of miR-124 and
 negatively regulated by miR-124. Our findings showed that Hic-5
 over-expression could significantly induce increases in cell viability,
 migration and invasion, and induce decrease in cell apoptosis after hypoxia
 damage. Over-expression of Hic-5 could increase the expression of Sp1 and
 Survivin, which inhibited the cell apoptosis, thereby reducing the cell
 damage induced by hypoxia.",
