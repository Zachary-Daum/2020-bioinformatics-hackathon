    abstract "Atherosclerosis is one common chronic inflammatory disease in
 which angiogenesis is involved. Here we established an in vitro cell model of
 angiogenesis made by human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1)
 and work to investigate the role of triptolide (TPL) in this model. To induce
 angiogenesis, HMEC-1 cells were cultured in Matrigel-conditioned medium. The
 ratio of tubes to nucleus was detected. To evaluate angiogenesis, Western
 blot assay was carried out to detect endothelial nitric oxide synthase
 (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) and VEGF. Cell
 counting kit-8 was utilized to estimate the viability of HMEC-1 cells.
 microRNA (miR)-92a was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The targeting relationship
 between integrin subunit alpha 5 (ITGA5) and miR-92a was verified through
 luciferase activity assay. The effects of ITGA5 on signaling transducers
 (ERK, PI3K, and AKT) in a phosphorylated form were valued using Western blot
 method. After stimulated by TPL, LY294002 and PD98059, the alteration in
 phosphorylation of the signaling transducers was evaluated by Western blot
 assay. The ratio of tubes to nucleus and angiogenesis related factors were
 increased with the delaying of culture time. TPL decreased the expression of
 angiogenesis factors. Furthermore, miR-92a was upregulated by TPL and miR-92a
 silence upregulated angiogenesis factors. In addition, TPL decreased ITGA5
 which was proved as a target of miR-92a. ITGA5 overexpression resulted in the
 abundance of angiogenesis factors while ITGA5 silence led to the opposite
 results. Meanwhile, ITGA5 overexpression increased phosphorylation of ERK,
 PI3K and AKT while ITGA5 silence reversed the trend. TPL (as an
 anti-angiogenesis agent) suppressed angiogenesis by upregulating miR-92a, and
 miR-92a-mediated down-regulation of ITGA5 blocked the signaling transduction
 of ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways.",
