    abstract "BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers (PUs) prevalence has been considered
 as an index for patient safety and cure quality of hospital and community.
 Skin cellular oxidative response damage is existed in the development of PUs.
 Angelica polysaccharide (AP) has the anti-oxidation function. Therefore, our
 goal was to investigate the mechanism of AP in relieving cellular oxidative
 damage. METHODS: Transfected HaCaT cells with miR-126 inhibitor, pre-treated
 by AP, and then treated by H2O2. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry detection
 were set to test viability and apoptosis of cells respectively. qRT-PCR and
 western blot tested levels of miR-126 and oxidative damage relative factors.
 ROS assay tested the production of ROS in cells. RESULTS: Cellular oxidative
 response damage was induced by H2O2 at concentration of 300muM. We found that
 AP could attenuate cellular oxidative response damage caused by H2O2 that it
 elevated cell viability, attenuated cell apoptosis and production of ROS and
 promoted activation of PI3K/AKT and mTOR signal pathways. Further, miR-126
 was up-regulated by AP. The up-regulation of miR-126 could activate the
 PI3K/AKT and mTOR signal pathways. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that AP
 attenuated cellular oxidative response damage in HaCaT cells by positively
 regulated miR-126.",
