    abstract "BACKGROUND: Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) has been reported to play
 a significant role in the cardiovascular and neuronal diseases. But, the
 functions of TMP in osteoarthritis (OA) remain unclear. In this
 investigation, we intended to probe the protective effectiveness of TMP in
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-caused damage in ATDC5 cells. METHODS: ATDC5 cells
 were managed with LPS (5mug/mL) for 12h, and then the effects of TMP on these
 cells were evaluated. Cell viability and apoptosis of these treated cells
 were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry methods. The secretions of
 IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were examined via applying ELISA kits. qRT-PCR
 was utilized to measure cell inflammatory factors and MyD88 expression. After
 transfection with pc-MyD88, the above-involved cell processes were
 reassessed, and NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways were examined by western blot
 assay. RESULTS: LPS treatment induced a series of inflammatory destructions,
 which reduced viability, accelerated apoptosis and cell inflammatory factors
 release in ATDC5 cells. However, TMP precondition clearly mitigated
 LPS-triggered ATDC5 cell injury. Additionally, TMP down-regulated MyD88
 expression in LPS-treated ATDC5 cells, as well as overexpression of MyD88
 overturned the impacts of TMP on LPS-induced cell injury in ATDC5 cells.
 Beyond that, TMP restrained LPS-triggered the activations of NF-kappaB and
 p38MAPK via repression of MyD88. CONCLUSION: The above consequences exhibited
 that TMP exhibited a protective effect to lighten LPS-caused cell damage via
 mediating MyD88/NF-kappaB/p38MAPK pathways. These findings suggested that TMP
 perhaps an effective agent for the clinical treatment of OA.",
