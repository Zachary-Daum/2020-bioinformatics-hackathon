    abstract "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a serious heart disease in which
 cardiomyocytes are damaged, caused by hypoxia. This study explored the
 possible protective activity of Skullcapflavone I (SF I), a flavonoid
 isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, on
 hypoxia-stimulated cardiomyocytes cell injury in vitro. Viability and
 apoptosis of H9c2 cells and primary cardiomyocytes were tested using cell
 counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Guava Nexin Reagent, respectively.
 Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was
 used to measure the long non-coding RNA regulator of reprogramming
 (lincRNA-ROR) expression. si-ROR was transfected to knockdown lincRNA-ROR.
 Western blotting was conducted to assess the protein levels of key molecules
 related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and mitogen-activated protein
 kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway. We discovered
 that hypoxia stimulation obviously reduced H9c2 cell and primary
 cardiomyocytes' viability and proliferation, but promoted cell apoptosis. SF
 I treatment mitigated the cell viability and proliferation inhibition, as
 well as cell apoptosis caused by hypoxia. Moreover, SF I promoted the
 hypoxia-caused up-regulation of lincRNA-ROR in H9c2 cells and primary
 cardiomyocytes. Knockdown of lincRNA-ROR reversed the influence of SF I on
 hypoxia-stimulated H9c2 cells and primary cardiomyocytes. Besides, SF I
 activated MEK/ERK pathway in H9c2 cells and primary cardiomyocytes via
 up-regulating lincRNA-ROR. To sum up, our research verified the beneficial
 activity of SF I on hypoxia-caused cardiomyocytes injury. SF I protected
 cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-caused injury through up-regulation of
 lincRNA-ROR and activation of MEK/ERK pathway.",
