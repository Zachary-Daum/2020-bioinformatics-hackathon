    abstract "Background: Glioma is a main cause of brain-cancer relevant
 death. The present paper designed to reveal the possible role of LSINCT5 in
 human glioma GL15 cells. Methods: LSINCT5 and miR-451 expression in glioma
 tissues was examined using qRT-PCR. The impacts of LSINCT5, miR-451 and Rac1
 in GL15 cells were checked by carrying out CCK-8 assay, transwell assay, and
 flow cytometric analysis. Further, the target gene of LSINCT5 and miR-451 was
 explored. Accumulation of PI3K/AKT, Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathway
 proteins was examined using Western blot. Results: LSINCT5 was highly
 expressed while miR-451 low expressed in glioma tissues when compared to
 normal controls. Down-regulating LSINCT5 effectively declined GL15 cells
 viability, migration and invasion, but accelerated apoptosis. Nonetheless,
 the above-mentioned effects of LSINCT5 down-regulation were weakened when
 miR-451 was silenced. Rac1 was a target of miR-451. The tumour-suppressive
 effects of miR-451 on GL15 cells were weakened when Rac1 was overexpressed.
 Further, LSINCT5-miR-451-Rac1 axis could impact the activation of PI3K/AKT,
 Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways. Conclusion: Down-regulation of
 LSINCT5 represses glioma cells growth and metastasis in vitro likely through
 targeting miR-451 and thereby inhibiting Rac1-regulated PI3K/AKT,
 Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways.",
