    abstract "Pituitary adenoma is one of the most common tumors in the
 neuroendocrine system. This study investigated the effects of long non-coding
 RNAs (lncRNAs) highly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) on rat secreting
 pituitary adenoma GH3 cell viability, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and
 hormone secretion, as well as the underlying potential mechanisms. Cell
 transfection and qRT-PCR were used to change and measure the expression
 levels of HULC, miR-130b, and FOXM1. Cell viability, migration, invasion, and
 apoptosis were assessed using trypan blue staining assay, MTT assay,
 two-chamber transwell assay, Guava Nexin assay, and western blotting. The
 concentrations of prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) in culture
 supernatant of GH3 cells were assessed using ELISA. The targeting
 relationship between miR-130b and FOXM1 was verified using dual luciferase
 activity. Finally, the expression levels of key factors involved in
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways were evaluated using western blotting.
 We found that HULC was highly expressed in GH3 cells. Overexpression of HULC
 promoted GH3 cell viability, migration, invasion, PRL and GH secretion, as
 well as activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways. Knockdown of HULC
 had opposite effects and induced cell apoptosis. HULC negatively regulated
 the expression of miR-130b, and miR-130b participated in the effects of HULC
 on GH3 cells. FOXM1 was a target gene of miR-130b, which was involved in the
 regulation of GH3 cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, as well
 as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways. In conclusion, HULC tumor-promoting
 roles in secreting pituitary adenoma might be via down-regulating miR-130b,
 up-regulating FOXM1, and activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways.",
