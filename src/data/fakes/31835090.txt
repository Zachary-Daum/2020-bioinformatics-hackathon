    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a neurological disease
 with high incidence and disability. In this paper, we made a foundational
 study in long non-coding RNA paternally expressed gene 10 (lncRNA PEG10) at
 PC-12 cells. METHODS: We used CCK8, flow cytometry, migration and invasion
 assay to detect changes at the cellular level. PEG10, microRNA-34a-5p
 (miR-34a-5p) and TLX transfected by transfection assay and amplified by
 real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). TLX expression and proteins about
 apoptosis and pathways were investigated by Western blot. Additionally, the
 relationship between PEG10 and miR-34a-5p, miR-34a-5p and TLX were examined
 through luciferase assay. RESULTS: H2O2-injury model was established.
 Knockdown PEG10 deteriorated H2O2-injury. miR-34a-5p was confirmed as a
 target of PEG10 and miR-34a-5p inhibitor remitted PEG10-induced H2O2-injury.
 Moreover, TLX was confirmed as a target miR-34a-5p and TLX remitted
 H2O2-injury. At last, TLX worked in H2O2-injury via Smad and Wnt/beta-catenin
 pathways. CONCLUSION: Knockdown PEG10 remitted H2O2-injury of PC-12 cells by
 targeting miR-34a-5p/TLX, and the behavior may be involved in Smad and
 Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.",
