    abstract "Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevailing primary
 bone tumour and the third prevalent tumour in children and adolescents.
 Despite advanced treatments, the survival rate of OS has not been effectively
 improved. Here, we intended to investigate the functional impacts of
 circ-ITCH on OS. Methods: Circ-ITCH expression in OS tissues and cells was
 evaluated utilizing qRT-PCR. Viability and proliferation of MG63 and Saos-2
 cells were determined by utilizing CCK-8 assay and BrdU assay. Transwell
 assay was utilized to investigate migration and invasion. Western blot was
 utilized to distinguish apoptosis and metastasis-related proteins expression.
 Sequentially, the above-mentioned parameters were reassessed when
 up-regulating miR-22. Results: Circ-ITCH was low expressed in OS tissues and
 cells. Overexpressing circ-ITCH facilitated apoptosis and repressed
 viability, proliferation, migration and invasion in MG63 and Saos-2 cells.
 MiR-22 expression was reduced by overexpressing circ-ITCH. The decline of
 viability, proliferation, migration and invasion made by overexpressing
 circ-ITCH was alleviated by up-regulating miR-22. Conclusively, circ-ITCH
 suppressed PTEN/PI3K/AKT and SP-1 pathways via down-regulating miR-22.
 Conclusion: Circ-ITCH took effects on apoptosis, viability, proliferation,
 migration and invasion through restraining PTEN/PI3K/AKT and SP-1 pathways
 via down-regulating miR-22 in MG63 and Saos-2 cells. Highlights Low
 expression of circ-ITCH is observed in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines;
 Overexpression circ-ITCH suppresses miR-22 expression; Circ-ITCH promotes
 proliferation and represses apoptosis by up-regulating miR-22; Circ-ITCH
 promotes migration and invasion by up-regulating miR-22; Circ-ITCH activates
 PTEN/PI3K/AKT and SP-1 pathways by up-regulating miR-22.",
