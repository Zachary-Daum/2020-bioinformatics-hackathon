    abstract "Lung cancer is a commonly diagnosed disease with poor prognosis.
 Novel therapeutic targets and deep understanding of the regulatory mechanisms
 in lung cancer are of great importance. We aimed to figure out the functional
 roles of lncRNA-activated by transforming growth factor-beta (ATB) in A549
 cells as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. ATB was
 non-physiologically expressed in A549 cells after cell transfection. Then,
 cell proliferation, expressions of proteins related to proliferation and
 epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion were
 measured by BrdU incorporation assay, Western blot analysis, and Transwell
 assay, respectively. Afterwards, miR-494 expression in transfected A549 cells
 was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Meanwhile, effects
 of miR-494 overexpression on ATB-overexpressed cells were assessed. Finally,
 the phosphorylation levels of AKT and key kinases in the Janus-activated
 kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3)
 pathway were detected by Western blot analysis. ATB overexpression promoted
 proliferation, migration, and invasion of A549 cells. Meanwhile, EMT of A549
 cells was also enhanced. ATB silence showed the opposite influence.
 Expression of miR-494 was negatively regulated by ATB. Following experiments
 showed ATB-induced alterations of proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT
 were all reversed by miR-494 overexpression. Finally, we proved that ATB
 increased phosphorylated levels of AKT, JAK1, and STAT3, and those increases
 were all reversed by miR-494 overexpression. We interestingly figured out
 that ATB promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT through
 down-regulating miR-494 in A549 cells. Moreover, ATB might activate AKT and
 the JAK/STAT3 pathway via down-regulating miR-494.",
