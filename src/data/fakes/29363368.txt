    abstract "Total glucosides of paeony (TGP) are active components extracted
 from the roots of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. In this study, we investigated the
 role and mechanisms of TGP in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) model of
 mice. The C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham group,
 EAU-control group, and EAU-TGP group. Clinical score of images of the eye
 fundus were taken on 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after induction of EAU. The
 concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in intraocular fluid were
 measured at 14 days after EAU induction with the use of a multiplex assay
 system. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the frequency of CD4+, CD8+,
 interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and CD4+/CD8+ ratio in spleen and lymph nodes.
 Western blotting was used to measure expressions of mitogen-activated protein
 kinase (MAPK) pathway-related proteins in retina. Clinical scores for uveitis
 were lower in TGP-treated EAU mice than those without TGP treatment.
 Importantly, the concentrations of cytokines induced by T-helper 1 (Th1) and
 T-helper 2 (Th2) cells in intraocular fluid were reduced in EAU mice treated
 with TGP. Furthermore, the frequency of CD4+, IFN-gamma, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio
 was decreased and the frequency of CD8+ was increased in spleen and lymph
 nodes of mice treated with TGP. The anti-inflammatory effects of TGP were
 mediated by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathways. Our results showed that
 TGP suppressed uveitis in mice via the inhibition of Th1 and Th2 cell
 function. Thus, TGP may be a promising therapeutic strategy for uveitis, as
 well as other ocular inflammatory diseases.",
