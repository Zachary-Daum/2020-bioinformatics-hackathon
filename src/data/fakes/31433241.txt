    abstract "Context: Morphine is an alkaloid isolated from the poppy plants.
 The addiction of morphine is a very serious social issue. Some long
 non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to engage in drug addiction.
 Objective: Whether lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) attended to
 morphine-mediated autophagy of mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells was
 probed. Materials and methods: HT22 cells were subjected to 10 microM
 morphine for 24 h. Cell autophagy was assessed by measuring LC3-II/LC3-I and
 Beclin-1 expression. qRT-PCR was carried out to measure MEG3 expression.
 SiRNA oligoribonucleotides targeting MEG3 (si-MEG3) was transfected to
 silence MEG3. The orexin1 receptor (OX1R), c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC
 expressions were tested by western blotting. SCH772984 was used as an
 inhibitor of ERK pathway. Results: Morphine elevated OX1R (2.92 times), c-fos
 (2.06 times), p/t-ERK (2.04 times) and p/t-PKC (2.4 times), Beclin-1 (3.2
 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (3.96 times) expression in HT22 cells. Moreover,
 followed by morphine exposure, the MEG3 expression was also elevated in HT22
 cells (3.03 times). The silence of MEG3 lowered the Beclin-1 (1.85 times),
 LC3-II/LC3-I (2.12 times), c-fos (1.39 times) and p/t-ERK (1.44 times)
 expressions in morphine-treated HT22 cells. Inhibitor of ERK pathway
 SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphine-caused
 Beclin-1 (1.97 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (1.92 times) expressions decreases.
 Conclusions: Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the morphine-caused autophagy
 of HT22 cells might be through elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK
 pathway activation. More experiments are also needed in the future to analyse
 the influence of other lncRNAs in drug addiction.",
