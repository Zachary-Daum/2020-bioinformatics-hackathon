    abstract "Context: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative arthrosis
 sickness. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) functions by relieving inflammatory
 damage.Objective: We aimed to investigate the mechanism by which AS-IV
 protects ATD cells from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced damage.Materials and
 methods: ATDC5 cells were transfected with miR-203 inhibitor and NC inhibitor
 (150 nM) or pEX-MyD88 and sh-MyD88 (50 nM) for 48 h, pre-treated by 15 mug/mL
 AS-IV for 24 h, then treated by 5 mug/mL LPS for 12 h. Dual-luciferase
 activity testing was used to determine whether miR-203 could bind to MyD88.
 CCK-8 and flow cytometry were used to detect cell activity and apoptosis,
 respectively, and qRT-PCR, western blots, and ELISA were performed to detect
 expression levels of miR-203 and inflammatory cytokines.Results: Based on the
 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50), there was no significant difference of
 AS-IV (0 to 15 mug/mL) on cell viability. Fifteen mug/mL was the optimal
 concentration of AS-IV in treating LPS-induced inflammatory damage in
 subsequent experiments since this was a semi-lethal concentration. AS-IV
 significantly reduces LPS-induced viability, apoptosis and the release of
 TNF-alpha, IL-6 and iNOS mainly through up-regulating miR-203. Further, MyD88
 was a target gene of miR-203 and negatively regulated by miR-203. Knockdown
 of MyD88 inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory damage by inhibiting the
 NF-kappaB signal pathway.Discussion and conclusions: AS-IV protects ATDC5
 cells against LPS-induced damage mainly via regulating miR-203/MyD88. Our
 results support a theoretical basis for in-depth study of the function of
 AS-IV and the clinical cure of OA.",
