    abstract "BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma (MB) is a malignant intracranial
 tumor. Cisplatin is a broad-spectrum antitumor drug. It is important to study
 the cisplatin resistance of MB cells for the treatment of MB. In this
 article, we preliminarily studied the cisplatin resistance of microRNA
 (miR)-31 and the possible mechanism in DAOY and UW228 cells, laying a
 theoretical foundation for clinical treatment of MB. METHODS: Following
 anti-miR-31 and pre-miR-31 transfections, cell viability, BrdU, CyclinD1, and
 apoptosis levels of DAOY and UW228 cell were detected by CCK8, BrdU, and
 western blot. Meanwhile, migration, invasion, and western blot assay were
 respectively used to detect the functions of miR-31 migration and invasion.
 miR-31 levels were changed by cell transfection and detected by RT-qPCR.
 Furthermore, the related-proteins of pathways were also detected by western
 blot. RESULTS: Anti-miR-31 increased DAOY and UW228 cells viability, BrdU(+)
 numbers, and expression of CyclinD1. The migration/invasion rate and
 expression levels of MMP-9 and vimentin after anti-miR-31 transfection were
 increased. Furthermore, anti-miR-31 enhanced cells' cisplatin resistance and
 triggered PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways. Pre-miR-31 played opposite roles
 and promoted the apoptosis. CONCLUSION: miR-31 regulated cell growth,
 migration, invasion and cisplatin resistance of MB cells via PI3K/AKT and
 NF-kappaB pathways.",
