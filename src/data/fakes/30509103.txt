    abstract "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor with high
 global increase and mortality. While Skullcapflavone I has been reported to
 exert anti-tumor effect in several cancers, its role in CRC has not
 previously been investigated. Recent studies have also demonstrated that
 microRNA-107 (miR-107) and tropomyosin alpha-1 (TPM1) are important
 regulators of cancer cell proliferation, but it remains unclear if these are
 involved in regulating the effect of Skullcapflavone I on CRC cells. This
 study therefore assessed the effects of Skullcapflavone I on CRC cell
 proliferation and investigated miR-107 and TPM1 regulatory effects on this
 process. The results showed that Skullcapflavone I significantly suppressed
 cell proliferation and viability and down-regulated PCNA and Cyclin D1protein
 levels. It also down-regulated miR-107 expression which then promoted TPM1
 expression, but miR-107 over-expression abolished Skullcapflavone I
 anti-proliferative effects. Furthermore, Skullcapflavone I inhibited the
 activations of MEK/ERK and NF-kappaB signal pathway activation by regulating
 TPM1 in HCT116 cells. These results demonstrated that Skullcapflavone I
 increased the expression of TPM1 by down-regulating miR-107 and inhibiting
 the MEK/ERK and NF-kappaB signal pathways. It then inhibited HCT116 cell
 proliferation, and therefore Skullcapflavone I may provide new methodology in
 colorectal cancer treatment.",
