    abstract "Gastric cancer (GC) is the most common gastrointestinal
 malignancy in the digestive system. Recent studies have proven that long
 non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related to tumor growth and metastasis.
 The study aimed to explore the effect of LINC00978 on GC cells proliferation
 and tumorigenesis. LINC00978 was up-regulated in GC tissues and cell lines.
 Up-regulation of LINC00978 was positively correlated with low survival rate.
 LINC00978 silence inhibited proliferation, metastasis, and promoted apoptosis
 in BGC-823 cells. Additionally, LINC00978 functioned as competing endogenous
 RNA to inhibit miR-497 expression. Further, NTRK3 was confirmed as a target
 gene of miR-497. Up-regulation of NTRK3 was found in GC tissues, and the
 positive correlation was presented between LINC00978 and NTRK3. Further,
 LINC00978 promoted cell proliferation and tumor weight by regulation of
 NTRK3. These findings demonstrated that LINC00978 promoted cell proliferation
 and tumorigenesis by regulating miR-497/NTRK3 axis in GC.",
