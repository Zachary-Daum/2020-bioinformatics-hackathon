    abstract "Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is frequently found in the
 tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma (OS). miR-376a was found to play tumor
 suppressive roles in human cancers. However, the role of miR-376a in OS
 remains unclear. The expression of miR-376a was analyzed by quantitative
 real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in OS cell lines. Cell proliferation assay, cell
 invasion assay, and cell apoptosis assay were performed to detect the
 biological function of miR-376a after synthetic miRNA transfection. The
 target of miR-376a was predicted by TargetScan and miRDB, and further
 validated by luciferase activity reporter assay and western blot. miR-376a
 expression was revealed to be decreased in OS cell lines. In vitro
 experiments showed that overexpression of miR-376a inhibits OS cell
 proliferation and invasion but promotes apoptosis. Luciferase activity
 reporter assay and western blot assay showed F-box protein 11 (FBXO11) was a
 direct target of miR-376a. Furthermore, FBXO11 mediated the role of miR-376a
 on the proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of OS cells. Collectively,
 these results revealed miR-376a functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting
 FBXO11 in OS. It may be developed as a therapeutic target for OS patients.",
