    abstract "This study aimed to investigate the role of long non-coding RNA
 DLEU1 in endometrial cancer (EC) development. The DLEU1 expression in EC
 tissues and cells (HHUA, KLE, Ishikawa, and ECC-1) were detected. The
 expression of DLEU1 was suppressed by transfection with sh-DLEU1 and the
 effects of DLEU1 suppression on the malignant behaviors of Ishikawa cells,
 including cell viability, apoptosis, migration and migration were then
 detected. In addition, the interaction of DLEU1 and miR-490 as well as
 between miR-490 and SP1 in EC were investigated. Furthermore, the regulatory
 relationship between DLEU1 and PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway was explored. DLEU1
 was upregulated in EC tissues and cells. Suppression of DLEU1 significantly
 inhibited Ishikawa cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis, decreased BCL-2
 expression and increased the expression of Bax, cleaved-caspase-3 and
 cleaved-caspase-3, suppressed cell migration and invasion, and inhibited EMT
 via increasing the expression of E-cadherin and decreasing the expression of
 N-cadherin, Snail and Vimentin. In addition, DLEU1 could sponge miR-490 and
 miR-490 inhibition significantly reversed the effects of DLEU1 suppression on
 the malignant behaviors of Ishikawa cells. Furthermore, SP1 was verified as a
 target of miR-490, and SP1 knockdown could reverse the effects of miR-490
 inhibition on the malignant behaviors of Ishikawa cells. Besides, suppression
 of DLEU1 inhibited PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway, while miR-490 inhibition
 activated this pathway that could be neutralized by SP1 knockdown. Our
 findings indicate that DLEU1 contributes to EC development by sponging
 miR-490 to regulate SP1 expression. DLEU1/miR-490/SP1 axis may provide a new
 strategy for EC therapy.",
