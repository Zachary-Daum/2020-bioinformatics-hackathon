    abstract "The beneficial function of gastrodin towards many inflammatory
 diseases has been identified. This study designed to see the influence of
 gastrodin in a cell model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
 MRC-5 cells were treated by LPS, before which gastrodin was administrated.
 The effects of gastrodin were evaluated by conducting CCK-8, FITC-PI double
 staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR and ELISA. Besides this, the downstream
 effector and signalling were studied to decode how gastrodin exerted its
 function. And dual-luciferase assay was used to detect the targeting link
 between miR-103 and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). LPS
 induced apoptosis and the release of MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in MRC-5
 cells. Pre-treating MRC-5 cells with gastrodin attenuated LPS-induced cell
 damage. Meanwhile, p38/JNK and NF-kappaB pathways induced by LPS were
 repressed by gastrodin. miR-103 expression was elevated by gastrodin.
 Further, the protective functions of gastrodin were attenuated by miR-103
 silencing. And LRP1 was a target of miR-103 and negatively regulated by
 miR-103. The in vitro data illustrated the protective function of gastrodin
 in LPS-injured MRC-5 cells. Gastrodin exerted its function possibly by
 up-regulating miR-103 and modulating p38/JNK and NF-kappaB pathways.",
