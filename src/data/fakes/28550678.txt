    abstract "Evidence suggests that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)
 metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is
 upregulated in cancer tissues, and its elevated expression is associated with
 hyperproliferation. However, the underlying mechanisms regarding the role of
 MALAT1 in retinoblastoma (RB) remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the
 functional role of MALAT1 in RB by targeting miR-124. The results showed that
 the expression of MALAT1 was significantly higher in the Y79 cell line than
 in the ARPE-19 cell line (p < 0.01). Moreover, MALAT1 silence inhibited cell
 viability, migration, and invasion and promoted apoptosis in Y79 cells (p <
 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001). miR-124 was upregulated by MALAT1 silence and
 hence was identified as a target of MALAT1 (p < 0.05 or p < 0.001). In
 addition, miR-124 suppression inhibited cell apoptosis and remarkably
 abolished the inhibitory effects of MALAT1 silence on cell viability,
 migration, and invasion (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001). In addition, Slug
 was a target of miR-124 and regulated cell viability, migration, invasion,
 and apoptosis in Y79 cells (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001). Further, Slug
 silence abolished miR-124 suppression-induced inactivation of the ERK/MAPK
 and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Taken together, our data highlight the pivotal
 role of MALAT1 in RB. Moreover, the present study elucidated the
 MALAT1-miR-124-ERK/MAPK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways in RB, which
 might provide a new approach for the treatment of RB.",
