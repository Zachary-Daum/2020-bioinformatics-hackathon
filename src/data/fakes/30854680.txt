    abstract "Despite the improvements in fracture healing, about 10% of
 patients undergo abnormal healing. As a tumor suppressor, upregulation of
 microRNA (miR)-203 has been observed in osteogenic differentiation. Herein,
 we aimed to explore the functional role of miR-203 in osteoblasts as well as
 the underlying mechanisms. The expression of miR-203 in MC3T3-E1 cells that
 underwent osteogenic differentiation was determined by quantitative reverse
 transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The effects of aberrantly expressed miR-203 on
 cell viability, migration, and expressions of proteins associated with
 proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation were measured by
 using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Transwell cell migration assay, and
 western blot/qRT-PCR, respectively. The possible downstream factor of miR-203
 was subsequently studied. Finally, involvements of the mitogen-activated
 protein kinase (MAPK)/activator of transcription (STAT) pathways were
 assessed by western blot. We found that the miR-203 level was increased in
 osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells with increasing duration time
 (28th day, p < 0.001). After cell transfection, we interestingly found that
 miR-203 overexpression could increase cell viability (p < 0.05), promote
 proliferation, migration (p < 0.05), and osteogenic differentiation, and
 upregulate Msh homeobox 2 (Msx2) expression. Furthermore, Msx2 knockdown was
 proved to abrogate the effects of miR-203 overexpression on MC3T3-E1 cells.
 Finally, phosphorylated levels of key kinases in the MAPK/STAT pathways were
 increased by miR-203 overexpression via upregulating Msx2 expression. In
 conclusion, miR-203 overexpression promoted proliferation, migration, and
 osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells through upregulating Msx2 along
 with activation of the MAPK/STAT pathways.",
