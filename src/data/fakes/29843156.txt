    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Resveratrol (RSV) has been reported as a
 promising oral supplementation for osteoarthritis treatment, while the
 mechanism of its action is still unclear. The specific aim of this study is
 to decode one of the mechanisms by which RSV protects chondrocyte. METHODS:
 Mouse chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 was treated with 30 microM RSV for 24 h,
 and 10 microg/ml LPS for 12 h, after which cell viability, apoptosis, and the
 release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed. The expression of
 miR-146b in ATDC5 cells was silenced by the specific inhibitor transfection,
 and then cell viability, apoptosis and inflammation were re-assessed.
 RESULTS: The IC50 value of LPS in ATDC5 cells was about 10.27 microg/ml. LPS
 with a dosage of 10 microg/ml repressed cell viability, induced apoptosis,
 and increased the release of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. RSV pre-treatment
 (30 microM) significantly alleviated LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation.
 More importantly, miR-146b was up-regulated by RSV, and the protective
 functions of RSV on ATDC5 cells were attenuated by miR-146b silence. Further,
 NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways were activated by LPS, and were deactivated by
 RSV. Besides, RSV-induced the deactivation of NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways
 was reversed by miR-146b silence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RSV
 protects ATDC5 cells from LPS-induced inflammatory and apoptotic injury via
 up-regulation of miR-146b and thereby deactivation of NF-kappaB and p38MAPK
 pathways.",
