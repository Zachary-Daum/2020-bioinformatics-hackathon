    abstract "BACKGROUND: Metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript
 1 (MALAT1) has been reported to be critical in the onset and progression of
 acute myocardial ischemia (AMI). This study attempted to reveal the
 biological function of MALAT1 in AMI. METHODS: Expression of MALAT1 in H9c2
 cells was silenced by shRNA-mediated transfection, following which cells were
 suffered from oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R). CCK-8, flow
 cytometry and western blot were carried out to evaluate the effects of MALAT1
 against OGD/R injury. Further, the correlation between MALAT1, miR-122 and
 AKT/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling was studied to decode the underlying
 mechanisms. RESULTS: MALAT1 expression was highly expressed following OGD/R.
 Suppression of MALAT1 attenuated OGD/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, as
 evidenced by the increase of cell viability and the decrease of apoptosis
 rate. Besides that, miR-122 was found to be positive regulated by MALAT1. The
 protective effects of MALAT1 knockdown were flattened by miR-122
 overexpression. Furthermore, AKT/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling was
 activated by MALAT1 knockdown. The effects of MALAT1 knockdown on the
 signaling were flattened when miR-122 was overexpressed. CONCLUSION: Our
 finding revealed protective effects of MALAT1 knockdown on OGD/R induced
 cardiomyocyte apoptosis. MALAT1 exerted its function possibly through
 regulating AKT/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling through up-regulating miR-122.",
