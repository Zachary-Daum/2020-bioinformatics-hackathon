    abstract "BACKGROUND: Curcumin, a primary active ingredient extracted from
 the Curcuma longa, has been recently identified as a potential anti-tumor
 agent in multiple kinds of cancers. However, the effect of curcumin on
 retinoblastoma (Rb) is still unclear. Therefore, we attempted to reveal the
 functional impacts and the underlying mechanisms of curcumin in Rb cells.
 METHODS: Two Rb cell lines SO-Rb50 and Y79 were pre-treated with various
 doses of curcumin, and then cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and
 invasion were assessed, respectively. Further, regulatory effects of curcumin
 on miR-99a expression, as well as the activation of JAK/STAT pathway were
 studied. RESULTS: Data showed that curcumin significantly inhibited the
 viability, colony formation capacity, migration and invasion, while induced
 apoptosis of SO-Rb50 and Y79 cells. Up-regulation of miR-99a was observed in
 curcumin-treated cells. Curcumin suppressed the phosphorylation levels of
 JAK1, STAT1, and STAT3, while curcumin did not inhibit the activation of
 JAK/STAT pathway when miR-99a was knocked down. CONCLUSION: Curcumin
 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, but promoted apoptosis of Rb
 cells. The anti-tumor activities of curcumin on Rb cells appeared to be via
 up-regulation of miR-99a, and thereby inhibition of JAK/STAT pathway.",
