    abstract "Glaucoma is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which produces
 damage to the optic nerve and causes sightlessness. Current remains lack of
 effective method for glaucoma. Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) have
 pleiotropic effects on various diseases. However, the effect of LBPs on
 glaucoma remains unclear. The study aimed to clarify the protective effect of
 LBPs against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage in human
 trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells. HTM cells were exposed to H2O2 (0-400muM)
 for 24h to construct an oxidative damage model. Then, the different
 concentrations of LBPs (0-500mugmL(-1)) were used to pre-treated HTM cells,
 and cell viability, apoptosis, protein levels of pro-/cleaved-caspase-3 and
 pro-/cleaved-caspase-9, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generations were
 detected. MicroRNA (miR)-4295 inhibitor and its control were transfected into
 HTM cells, and the biological functions of miR-4295 were assessed in H2O2 and
 LBPs treated cells. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein Kinase B
 (AKT) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathways were
 determined by western blot assay. LBPs significantly promoted cell viability,
 reduced apoptosis, declined cleaved-caspase-3/-9 and ROS level in HTM cells
 after H2O2 administration. MiR-4295 expression was up-regulated in H2O2 and
 LBPs treated cells. The protective effect of LBPs on H2O2-injured HTM cells
 was obviously reversed by miR-4295 inhibition. LBPs activated PI3K/AKT and
 ERK signaling pathways through up-regulation of miR-4295 in H2O2-injured HTM
 cells. These data demonstrated that LBPs alleviated H2O2-induced injury by
 up-regulation of miR-4295 in HTM cells, indicating the protective effect of
 LBPs on HTM cells against oxidative damage.",
