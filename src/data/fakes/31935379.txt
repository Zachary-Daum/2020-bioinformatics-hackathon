    abstract "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the common malignant
 tumors in women. CCAT1 is a novel lncRNA and its knockdown can inhibit
 viability, migration and invasion in CC cells. Here, we aimed to further
 explore the roles of CCAT1 knockdown and underlying mechanism to provide
 theoretical support for the application of CCAT1 knockdown in treating CC.
 METHODS: The expression level of CCAT1 in CC tissues was examined by using
 qRT-PCR. Si-CCAT1, pc-Runx2 and relative control were transfected into HeLa
 and SiHa cells to explore the functional mechanism of CCAT1. The effects of
 CCAT1 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were examined
 via BrdU incorporation assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay. The
 expression of Runx2 and other relative factors was examined via qRT-PCR and
 western blot analysis. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that CCAT1 was highly
 expressed in CC tissues contrasted with adjacent tissues. The proliferation,
 migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were
 suppressed, while the apoptosis was promoted by CCAT1 knockdown. Moreover,
 knockdown of CCAT1 could negatively regulate Runx2 to play anti-tumor roles
 in HeLa and SiHa cells. Further, CCAT1 knockdown could suppress PI3K/AKT
 signal pathway. CONCLUSION: Knockdown of CCAT1 suppressed proliferation, EMT,
 migration and invasion in HeLa and SiHa cells through down-regulating Runx2,
 which provided theoretical support for its application in CC treatment.",
