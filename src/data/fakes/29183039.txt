    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Osteoarthritis (OA) as a degenerative disease
 is a major problem in ageing populations. To better understand the molecular
 mechanisms in the pathogenesis of OA, this study explored the role of
 microRNA (miR)-146a in the articular chondrocytes. METHODS: The articular
 chondrocyte line ATDC5 was used to simulate inflammatory injury by LPS
 administration in vitro. Cell viability, apoptosis, mRNA expressions and
 productions of inflammatory factors were assessed, respectively. Mir-146a and
 Cxcr4 mRNA expressions were measured by qRT-PCR. Targeting effect of miR-146a
 on Cxcr4 3'UTR was assessed by luciferase activity analysis. Protein
 expression levels of CXCR4 and main factors in PI3K/AKT, Wnt/beta-catenin
 signal pathways were measured by western blotting. RESULTS: LPS exposure
 suppressed cell viability, prompted apoptosis of ATDC5 cells, and stimulated
 expression and release of inflammatory factors. MiR-146a was upregulated in
 LPS-induced cells. Overexpression of miR-146a further aggravated LPS-induced
 inflammatory injury, while it was reduced after miR-146a was knocked down.
 CXCR4 expression was negatively regulated by miR-146a. CXCR4 was a direct
 target of miR-146a and thus involved in regulatory effect of miR-146a on the
 injured chondrocytes, which was also related with phosphorylation levels of
 PI3K/AKT and expressions of Wnt/beta-catenin signal factors. CONCLUSION:
 miR-146a promoted inflammatory response of articular chondrocytes via
 targeting CXCR4 and suppressing CXCR4 expression. Overexpression of CXCR4
 could attenuate the inflammatory injury. Our findings provided novel evidence
 which might be useful for further studies exploring therapeutic approaches
 for OA via targeting miR-146a.",
