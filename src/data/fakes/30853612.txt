    abstract "Even though recent therapeutic advances make retinoblastoma (RB)
 becomes a curable tumor, the outcome of long-term survival is poor due to the
 risk of developing secondary tumors. We aimed to explore the functional role
 of Ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2) in human RB cells and the underlying mechanisms.
 Human RB Y79 and RBL-13 cells were incubated with or without GRh2, followed
 by assessments of cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis using Cell
 Counting Kit-8, bromodeoxyuridine, and flow cytometry assays. Meanwhile,
 expression levels of proteins associated with cell cycle, apoptosis,
 autophagy and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mechanistic target
 of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as well as p53 were measured by Western blot
 analysis. The mRNA expression of cyclinD1, autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7)
 and p53, and microRNA (miR)-638 expression were analyzed using quantitative
 reverse transcription PCR. Then, miR-638 was overexpressed in Y79 and RBL-13
 cells followed by treatment with GRh2, and p53 and proteins involved in the
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were assessed. Results showed that Y79 and RBL-13 cells
 viabilities were significantly reduced by 20-50muM GRh2. Cell proliferation
 was decreased, and cell apoptosis and autophagy were promoted by 30muM GRh2
 in Y79 and RBL-13 cells. GRh2 decreased miR-638 expression, up-regulated p53
 expression, and reduced phosphorylated levels of PI3K, AKT and mTOR. More
 experiments showed GRh2-induced alterations of p53, phospho (p)-PI3K, p-AKT
 and p-mTOR were all reversed by miR-638 overexpression. The observations
 demonstrated that GRh2 functioned in cell proliferation, apoptosis and
 autophagy in Y79 and RBL-13 cells through miR-638-mediated up-regulation of
 p53 and inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",
