    abstract "BACKGROUND: Expression of long noncoding (lncRNA) Malat1 can be
 increased by hypoxia in cardiomyocyte. Downregulation of Malat1 contributes
 to the reduction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. However, the function of Malat1
 in myocardial ischemia is unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the
 functional role of lncRNA Malat1 in hypoxia-induced H9c2 cell injury.
 MATERIAL AND METHODS: H9c2 cells were exposed to hypoxia treatment. Cell
 proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were detected using trypan
 blue exclusion assay, two-chamber migration/invasion assay, annexin V-FITC/PI
 staining, and western blotting, respectively. Quantitative real-time
 polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to analyze the expression
 levels of Malat1. The effects of Malat1 knockdown on cell proliferation,
 migration, invasion, and apoptosis were also measured. The interaction
 between Malat1 and microRNA-217 (miR-217) as well as miR-217 and sirtuin 1
 (Sirt1) were analyzed using a dual luciferase reporter assay and qRT-PCR.
 Effects of miR-217 and Sirt1 on hypoxia-induced H9c2 cell growth were
 assessed. RESULTS: Hypoxia induced H9c2 cell injury by inhibiting cell
 proliferation, migration and invasion, and by promoting apoptosis. Hypoxia
 significantly enhanced the expression of Malat1. Malat1 bound to miR-217 and
 Sirt1 was a direct target of miR-217. Knockdown of Malat1 aggravated
 hypoxia-induced H9c2 cell injury by overexpression of miR-217. Overexpression
 of Sirt1 alleviated H9c2 cell injury by activating phosphatidylinositol
 3-kinase/protein kinase 3 (PI3K/AKT) and Notch signaling pathways.
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Malat1 exerted important roles in
 hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury by regulating miR-217-mediated Sirt1 and
 downstream PI3K/AKT and Notch signaling pathways.",
