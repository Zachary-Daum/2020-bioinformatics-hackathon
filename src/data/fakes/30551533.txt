    abstract "BACKGROUND: Even though the role of long non-coding RNA H19
 (lncRNA-H19) in diverse cancer types has been studied, exact effect of
 lncRNA-H19 as well as the underlying mechanism in retinoblastoma (RB) is
 poorly reported. We aimed to explore the possible functions of lncRNA-H19 in
 human RB Y79 cells. METHODS: LncRNA-H19 in Y79 cells was silenced, and
 effects of lncRNA-H19 silence on cell viability, migration and invasion, and
 apoptosis were analyzed by using trypan blue exclusion, Transwell assay, and
 flow cytometry assay/Western blot analysis, respectively. Then, miR-143
 expression in cells with lncRNA-H19 silence was determined by RT-qPCR, and
 effects of miR-143 inhibition on lncRNA-H19-suppressing cells were assessed.
 Whether RUNX2 was a target of miR-143 and the involved signaling pathways in
 the modulation of miR-143 were also studied. RESULTS: LncRNA-H19 knockdown
 repressed cell viability, migration and invasion while promoted apoptosis in
 Y79 cells. miR-143 was a downstream factor of lncRNA-H19, and its inhibition
 reversed the effects of lncRNA-H19 silence on Y79 cells. RUNX2 was a target
 gene of miR-143, and miR-143 was found to affect Y79 cells via
 down-regulation of RUNX2. Phosphorylation of key kinases related in the
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways was reduced by miR-143 via regulation of RUNX2.
 CONCLUSION: Knockdown of lncRNA-H19 acted a tumor suppressive role in Y79
 cells through up-regulating miR-143. Moreover, miR-143 exerted tumor
 suppressive effects on Y79 cells by targeting RUNX2, along with inhibition of
 the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways.",
