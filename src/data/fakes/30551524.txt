    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Coronary heart disease is a common cause of death and
 disability worldwide and mainly results from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion
 (I/R) injury. This study aimed to elucidate the roles and possible mechanism
 of long noncoding RNA Component Of Mitochondrial RNA Processing
 Endoribonuclease (RMRP) in protecting against ischemic myocardial injury.
 MATERIAL AND METHODS: The H9c2 cardiomyocytes were cultured under hypoxia
 condition to induce myocardial injury. The RMRP expression under hypoxia
 condition was determined, followed by investigation of the effects of RMRP
 dysregulation on hypoxia-induced injury in H9c2 cells. In addition, the
 regulatory relationship between RMRP and miR-206 was detected, and the
 potential target of miR-206 was identified. Besides, the association of RMRP
 and activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was explored. Furthermore,
 an in vivo rat model of myocardial I/R injury was established by subjection
 to 60 min ischemia and subsequently 24 h reperfusion for validation of the
 role of RMRP in regulating myocardial I/R injury in vivo. RESULTS: The
 results showed that overexpression of RMRP aggravated hypoxia-induced injury
 in H9c2 cells. Moreover, miR-206 was negatively regulated by RMRP and
 overexpression of RMRP aggravated hypoxia injury by downregulation of
 miR-206. Furthermore, ATG3 was a target of miR-206, and he effects of miR-206
 on hypoxia injury were through targeting ATG3. Besides, overexpression of
 RMRP activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells, which
 were reversed by miR-206 overexpression at the same time. Furthermore, in an
 in vivo rat model of myocardial I/R injury, suppression of RMPR improved
 cardiac function and inhibited apoptosis after myocardial I/R injury.
 CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that upregulation of RMRP may aggravate
 myocardial I/R injury possible by downregulation of miR-206 and subsequently
 upregulation of ATG3. Activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway may be a key
 downstream mechanism mediating the cardioprotection of RMPR/miR-206/ATG3 axis
 against myocardial I/R injury.",
