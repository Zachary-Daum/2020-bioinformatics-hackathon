    abstract "This study aimed to explore the role of MALAT1 in sepsis-induced
 cardiac inflammation and dysfunction. We constructed the rat sepsis models
 through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The cardiac function, including
 left ventricular peak pressure (LVPP), left ventricular end diastolic
 pressure (LVEDP) and maximum rate of rise/fall of left ventricle pressure
 (+/-dp/dtmax) as well as the contents of serum cardiac troponin I (CTn-I),
 creatine kinase (CK), and creative kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) were detected
 after modeling. Additionally, the blood cytokines levels including tumor
 necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, IL-10,
 IL-17, and IFN-gamma and complement proteins of C5 and C5a after modeling
 were detected. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay was performed to
 investigate the regulatory miRNA of MALAT1. The protein expressions of p38
 MAPK, NFkappaB, JAK2 and STAT3 were detected using western blot. MALAT1
 expression was significantly upregulated in CLP-induced sepsis model. MALAT1
 knockdown significantly increased LVSP and +dp/dsmax, decreased LVEDP and
 -dp/dsmax of sepsis as well as levels of cTn-I, CK, CK-MB, TNF-alpha,
 IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-gamma, C5 and C5a. MALAT1 was regulated by
 miR-125b, and miR-125b overexpression and MALAT1 knockdown had similar
 effects on sepsis rat models. Furthermore, MALAT1 induced cardiac dysfunction
 and inflammation in CLP models via activating p38 MAPK/NFkappaB. Our results
 suggest that MALAT1 aggravates cardiac inflammation and dysfunction in
 sepsis, which is achieved via interaction with miR-125b and p38
 MAPK/NFkappaB. MALAT1 may serve as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target
 in sepsis.",
