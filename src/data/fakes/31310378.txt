    abstract "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a serious hazard to the
 elderly in the lower extremity atherosclerotic plaque, accompanied by a large
 number of angiogenesis. Long noncoding RNA Alu-mediated p21 transcriptional
 regulator (APTR) exerts important functions in promoting cell growth.
 Therefore, we planned to research the mechanism of APTR in angiogenesis in
 PAD. CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, and migration assay were to detect
 cell viability, apoptosis, and migration respectively. The interaction
 between APTR and miR-12 was tested through luciferase activity test. In vitro
 angiogenesis assay was used to test the number of tubular cells. qRT-PCR and
 Western blot were to test expression of APTR, miR-126, and angiogenesis
 relative factors. There was spontaneously pipe-formation in HEMC-1 cells
 under matrigel condition. Knockdown of APTR inhibited cell viability and
 migration and reduced the number of tubular cells. Further, APTR sponged
 miR-126 and downregulating miR-126 to promote angiogenesis. Overexpression of
 APTR promoted cell activity and migration and increased the number of tubular
 cells via negatively regulating miR-126. APTR could elevate activating
 phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B and mitogen extracellular
 kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal pathways via negatively
 regulating miR-126 to promote cell proliferation, migration, and
 pipe-formation. We researched the mechanism of angiogenesis that APTR
 elevated proliferation, migration, and pipe-formation via negatively
 regulating miR-126.",
