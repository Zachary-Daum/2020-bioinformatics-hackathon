    abstract "Renal tubular damage caused by persistent high glucose
 environment has been found to contribute to diabetic nephropathy. This study
 explored the effects of lncRNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) on high
 glucose-stimulated human renal tubular epithelial HK-2 damage, as well as the
 possible internal molecular mechanism. Viability and apoptosis of HK-2 cells
 were assessed with the help of CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining,
 respectively. Cell transfection was used to change the expression of GAS5,
 miR-27a and BNIP3. We found that high glucose stimulation suppressed HK-2
 cell viability but induced cell apoptosis. The expression of GAS5 was
 increased in HK-2 cells under high glucose environment. Silence of GAS5
 mitigated the high glucose-caused HK-2 cell viability reduction and
 apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-27a reversed the effects of GAS5 on high
 glucose-stimulated HK-2 cells. Overexpression of BNIP3 aggravated the high
 glucose-caused HK-2 cell viability reduction, apoptosis and activation of JNK
 pathway. Knockdown of BNIP3 had opposite effects. In conclusion, this
 research further confirmed the pro-apoptotic roles of GAS5 in renal tubular
 epithelial cells under high glucose environment. Silence of GAS5 alleviated
 high glucose toxicity to human renal tubular epithelial HK-2 cells might be
 via down-regulating miR-27a and BNIP3, and then inactivating JNK pathway.
 Highlights HG suppresses HK-2 cell viability, but promotes cell apoptosis; HG
 enhances the expression of GAS5 in HK-2 cells; Silence of GAS5 alleviates the
 HG-caused HK-2 cell toxicity; miR-27a participates in the effects of GAS5
 silencing on HG-stimulated HK-2 cells; BNIP3 is regulated by miR-27a and
 related to the HG toxicity to HK-2 cells.",
