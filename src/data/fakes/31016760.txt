    abstract "The potential usage of curcumin in diverse human diseases has
 been widely studied, including arteriosclerosis (AS). This study focused on
 investigating the relationship between curcumin and AS-associated microRNA,
 which may provide a better understanding of curcumin in a different
 mechanism. Human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells were treated by
 curcumin alone or oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) plus curcumin,
 after which the following parameters were analyzed: cell viability,
 migration, and the expression of AS-associated factors. The regulatory
 effects of curcumin on miR-126 and signaling pathways involved in AS were
 then studied. Further, an animal model of AS was stimulated by feeding
 rabbits with 1% cholesterol diet. The effects of curcumin on the animal model
 were explored. We found that curcumin treatment significantly reduced HMEC-1
 cells viability, migration, and the protein levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, and
 vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the presence or absence of
 ox-LDL. Meanwhile, the expression of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 was repressed by
 curcumin. miR-126 was upregulated by curcumin. The abovementioned effects of
 curcumin on HMEC-1 cells were all attenuated when miR-126 was silenced. And
 also, VEGF was a target gene of miR-126, and curcumin could inhibit the
 activation of PI3K/AKT JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathways via miR-126. The effects
 of curcumin and its regulation on miR-126 and VEGF were confirmed in the
 animal model of AS. To sum up, curcumin exerted potent anti-AS property
 possibly via upregulating miR-126 and thereby inhibiting PI3K/AKT and
 JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathways.",
