    abstract "Background/aim: Colon cancer-associated transcript 2 (CCAT2) is
 a new lncRNA, which is closely associated with risk of several cancers. The
 aim of this study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of CCAT2 in
 osteosarcoma (OSA). Methods: Cells were transfected with si-CCAT2, microRNA
 (miR)-200b inhibitor and the corresponding controls. Quantitative reverse
 transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the
 expression of CCAT2 and miR-200b in OSA tissues and cell lines. CCK8 and
 bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were conducted to examine cell proliferation.
 Apoptosis was detected by PI/FITC-Annexin V combining with flow cytometric
 analysis. Migration and invasion were respectively measured through transwell
 chambers assays. Western blot was used to examine expressions of relative
 proteins. Results: CCAT2 was highly expressed and miR-200b was lowly
 expressed in OSA tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of CCAT2 suppressed cell
 proliferation, migration and invasion but induced apoptosis and up-regulation
 of miR-200b. miR-200b inhibitor weakened the effect of si-CCAT2 on cell
 progression and cell mobility. Besides, knockdown of CCAT2 blocked the
 PI3K/Akt and AMPK pathways through up-regulating miR-200b. Conclusions: The
 CCAT2/miR-200b/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) axis plays important
 regulating effect in OSA through the PI3K/Akt and AMPK pathways.",
