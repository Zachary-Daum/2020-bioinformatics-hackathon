    abstract "BACKGROUND: Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) is a crucial membrane
 proteoglycan, which is confirmed to participate in several tumor cell
 biological processes. However, the biological significance of SDC-1 in
 colorectal carcinoma is not yet clear. An objective of this study was to
 investigate the role of SDC-1 in colorectal carcinoma cells. METHODS:
 Expression of SDC-1 in colorectal carcinoma tissues was evaluated by Reverse
 transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot. After
 transfection with pcDNA3.1 or pc-SDC-1, the transfection efficiency was
 measured. Next, SW480, SW620 and LOVO cell viability, apoptosis, migration
 and adhesion were assessed to explore the effects of exogenous overexpressed
 SDC-1 on colorectal carcinoma. In addition, the influences of aberrant
 expressed SDC-1 in Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/signal transducer and activator of
 transcription 3 (STAT3) and rat sarcoma virus (Ras)/rapidly accelerated
 fibrosarcoma (Raf)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular
 signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways were detected by western blot
 analysis. RESULTS: SDC-1 mRNA and protein levels were down-regulated in human
 colorectal carcinoma tissues. SDC-1 overexpression inhibited cell
 proliferation via suppressing CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression, meanwhile
 stimulated cell apoptosis via increasing the expression levels of B-cell
 lymphoma-2-associated x (Bax) and Cleaved-Caspase-3. Additionally, SDC-1
 overexpression restrained cell migration via inhibiting the protein
 expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), and elicited cell adhesion
 through increasing intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).
 Furthermore, SDC-1 overexpression suppressed JAK1/STAT3 and
 Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK-related protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the evidence
 from this study suggested that SDC-1 suppressed cell growth, migration
 through blocking JAK1/STAT3 and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways in human colorectal
 carcinoma cells.",
