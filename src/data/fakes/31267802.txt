    abstract "H19 is the first identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) whose
 function in diverse cancers and non-cancerous disease states has been widely
 studied. The objective of this study was to study the functional role of H19
 in vascular endothelial cells. We found that H19 overexpression significantly
 increased HMEC-1 cells viability, migration and tube-formation capacity.
 Meanwhile, H19 overexpression up-regulated the protein levels of MMP-2,
 MMP-9, VEGF and eNOS, and down-regulated RNA level of miR-181a. These
 alterations, induced by H19 overexpression were abolished by miR-181a
 overexpression, while they were enhanced when miR-181a was silenced. And
 also, overexpression of H19 activated JNK and AMPK signalling, which could be
 eliminated by miR-181a overexpression and accelerated by miR-181a
 suppression. In conclusion, overexpression of H19 improved HMEC-1 cells
 viability, migration and tube-formation capacity. H19 exerted pro-angiogenic
 effects possibly by down-regulating miR-181a, and thus activating JNK and
 AMPK signalling pathways.",
