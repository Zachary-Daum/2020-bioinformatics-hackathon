    abstract "Background/aim: Pressure ulcers are a disastrous health issue in
 which inflammation is involved. Emodin possesses biological properties in
 inflammation. Our study investigated functions of emodin in
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated HaCaT cells. Methods: LPS was used to induce
 cell inflammation. MTT and flow cytometry were applied for cell viability and
 apoptosis assays, respectively. Moreover, apoptotic proteins were detected by
 western blot. Similarly, inflammatory factors and signalling related proteins
 were also determined by western blot. Results: Emodin increased cell
 viability and diminished apoptosis in LPS-treated HaCaT cells. Moreover,
 cleaved-PARP, cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-9 were all downregulated
 by emodin. Furthermore, inflammatory factors IL-1beta, IL-6, Cox-2 and iNOS
 were inhibited by emodin in LPS-treated cells. In addition, emodin decreased
 phosphorylation of p65 and IkappaBalpha and the level of PTEN while enhanced
 phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. Importantly, emodin increased expression of
 miR-21 suppressed by LPS and miR-21 downregulation negated the protective
 functions of emodin. Conclusions: Emodin promoted cell growth presented by
 increasing viability and blocking apoptosis process with inflammation
 inhibition. The protective activity of emodin was mediated by miR-21
 up-regulation.",
