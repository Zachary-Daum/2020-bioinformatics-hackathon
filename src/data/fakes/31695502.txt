    abstract "Background: H2BK12ac is an important histone acetylation pattern
 of H2B, which has been reported in several cancers. However, whether H2BK12ac
 joins in Ras-ERK1/2 activation-induced osteosarcoma (OS) cell behaviors
 remain unclear. The study explored this peradventure and revealed the
 underlying mechanism. Methods: MG-63 cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1,
 pEGFP-Ras(WT) and pEGFP-K-Ras(G12V/T35S), H2BK12ac and ERK1/2 expression
 levels were analyzed by Western blot. Effects of H2BK12ac on cell viability,
 migration, colony formation and cell cycle were investigated by MTT,
 Transwell, soft-agar colony formation and flow cytometry assays. RT-qPCR and
 ChIP were performed to study the effect of H2BK12ac and CBP on
 ERK1/2-downstream gene transcriptions. Results: H2BK12ac was specifically
 down-regulated by Ras-ERK1/2 activation in MG-63 cells. Down-regulated
 H2BK12ac participated in regulating cell proliferation and migration of MG-63
 cells, meanwhile, affected the transcription of ERK1/2-downstream genes.
 Additionally, silence of HDAC1 up-regulated H2BK12ac expression, and
 inhibited the promoting effect of Ras-ERK1/2 on MG-63 cells' proliferation,
 migration and RNA expression levels of ERK1/2-downstream genes. Further, the
 degradation of CBP mediated by MDM2 was discovered to be linked to Ras-ERK1/2
 activation-induced H2BK12ac down-regulation. Conclusion: These findings from
 the study demonstrated that Ras-ERK1/2 signaling could promote the
 development of OS via regulating H2BK12ac through MDM2-mediated CBP
 degradation.",
