    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play
 vital roles in osteoarthritis (OA), whereas the role of lncRNA RP11-445H22.4
 in OA remains unclear. The study aimed to investigate the effect of lncRNA
 RP11-445H22.4 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cell viability, apoptosis
 and inflammatory injury of OA. METHODS: The expression of RP11-445H22.4,
 miR-301a and CXCR4 in human cartilage ATDC5 cells were altered by
 transfection, and then cells were exposed to 5 microg/ml LPS for 12 h. Then
 cell viability, apoptosis, apoptosis-related factors and inflammatory
 cytokines were analyzed by CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot, RT-qPCR and
 ELISA, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to assess
 the binging sites of RP11-445H22.4 and miR-301a. The signal pathways of
 NF-kappaB and MAPK/ ERK were determined by western blot. RESULTS: LPS reduced
 cell viability, increased apoptosis and stimulated release of IL-1beta, IL-6,
 IL-8 and TNF-alpha. However, RP11-445H22.4 inhibition significantly rescued
 LPS-induced injuries by promoting cell viability, suppressing apoptosis and
 inflammatory cytokines secretions in ATDC5 cells. In addition, miR-301a
 directly bound to RP11-445H22.4, and suppression of miR-301a inversed the
 effects of RP11-445H22.4 inhibition. Furthermore, CXCR4 was a direct target
 of miR-301a, and CXCR4 silencing increased cell viability, decreased
 apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines secretions in LPS-treated ATDC5 cells.
 Besides, we found that CXCR4 silencing blocked LPS-activated NF-kappaB and
 MAPK/ERK pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that lncRNA
 RP11-445H22.4-miR-301a-CXCR4 axis played an important role in cartilage ATDC5
 cells and provided a theoretical basis of lncRNA RP11-445H22.4 in OA.",
