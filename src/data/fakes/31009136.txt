    abstract "Sapylin (OK-432) revealed biological properties in cancers. In
 this study, the effect of sapylin on lung cancer cell A549 was investigated.
 A549 cell lines were treated with sapylin (0.1, 0.5, and 1 KE/mL) for
 different time intervals. A549 cell proliferation and apoptosis was
 determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
 bromide/Ki67 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot was used to
 determine the expressions of proteins involved in proliferation, apoptosis,
 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT),
 Wnt3a/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Level of intracellular reactive oxygen
 species (ROS) was insured by using the ROS kit. Sapylin inhibited A549 cell
 viability and the expressions of proliferation-related proteins (cyclin E1
 and D1) in dose- and time-dependent manners. Sapylin promoted apoptosis in a
 dose- and time-dependent manners. Sapylin also promoted the expressions of
 apoptotic proteins (cleaved caspase-3 and 8) in dose- and time-dependent
 manners. Furthermore, sapylin increased the intracellular concentration of
 ROS in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, the high expression of ROS level
 might induce inhibition of cell viability and increase cell apoptosis. The
 mechanistic study revealed that sapylin inactivated the PI3K/AKT and
 Wnt3a/beta-catenin signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that sapylin
 inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis in lung cancer cells, thus
 providing a new theoretical basis for the treatment of lung cancer.",
