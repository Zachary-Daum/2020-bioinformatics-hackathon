    abstract "Gastric cancer is the main leading cause of cancer-related death
 worldwide. The aberrant expression of paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) is
 involved in development of a range of cancers. However, the potential
 biological function and the underling mechanism of PEG10 in human gastric
 carcinoma are still unknown. Knocking down LncRNA PEG10 might represent a
 promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer. The
 expression of PEG10, miR-3200, and AEG1 in human gastric carcinoma NCI-N87
 cells were altered by cell transfection assay. Cell viability, migration,
 invasion, and apoptosis were determined by trypan blue exclusion, Transwell
 assay, and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. RNA and protein expression
 level of gene was analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot. Luciferase
 reporter assay was conducted to determine the target gene of miR-3200. JNK
 and Wnt signal pathway protein expressions were tested by Western blot. The
 up-regulation of PEG10 was found in clinical samples. PEG10 knockdown
 effectively inhibited gastric carcinoma cell viability, migration, and
 invasion, but promoted cell apoptosis. This tumor-suppressing effect of PEG10
 knockdown might be realized by up-regulating miR-3200 in vitro and in vivo.
 AEG1 was a direct target gene of miR-3200. Moreover, miR-3200 might suppress
 NCI-N87 cells by negative regulating AEG1. Up-regulating miR-3200 effectively
 blocked JNK and Wnt pathways likely via down-regulating AEG1. PEG10 knockdown
 played a carcinostatic role via up-regulating miR-3200 and further regulating
 AEG1 in gastric carcinoma cells, during which process, JNK pathway and Wnt
 pathway were blocked.",
