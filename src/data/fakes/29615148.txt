    abstract "Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to participate
 in multiple biological processes. However, the effects of miR-495 on gastric
 cancer (GC) remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the
 functions of miR-495 in GC cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis.
 SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cell lines were transfected with miR-495 mimic, miR-495
 inhibitor, and negative controls (mimic control and inhibitor control). The
 expressions of miR-495, cell viability, migration, apoptosis, and
 apoptosis-related factors were examined by qRT-PCR, trypan blue staining,
 Transwell, flow cytometry, and Western blot, respectively. Simultaneously,
 key factor expression levels of EMT were detected by qRT-PCR and Western
 blot. The direct target of miR-495 was confirmed by dual-luciferase assay.
 Additionally, sh-Twist1, pc-Twist1, and corresponding controls were
 transfected into SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells, and the protein levels of
 EMT-associated factors were detected by Western blot. miR-495 was
 downregulated in GC cells. miR-495 expression level was effectively
 overexpressed or suppressed in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells. Overexpression of
 miR-495 significantly decreased cell viability and migration, increased
 apoptosis, and inhibited the EMT process. Suppression of miR-495 showed
 contrary results. Twist1 was clarified as a target gene of miR-495, and
 Twist1 silencing obviously reduced the promoting effect of miR-495
 suppression on these biological processes. Twist1 silencing significantly
 blocked the EMT process in both SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells. miR-495 inhibited
 proliferation and metastasis and promoted apoptosis by targeting Twist1 in GC
 cells. These data indicated that miR-495 might be a novel antitumor factor of
 GC and provide a new method for the treatment of GC.",
