    abstract "Neuroblastoma (NB) is a serious disease with high-risk and poor
 prognosis in children. Survivors often have serious side effects. Angelica
 polysaccharide (AP) has been proved to exert antitumor function. Therefore,
 we explored the mechanism of this function in NB to accelerate the clinical
 application of AP in NB therapy. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with miR-205
 inhibitor and pretreated by AP. Cell activity, colonies number, and apoptosis
 were detected via Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation experiment, and
 flow cytometry, respectively. Targeting link between miR-205 and zinc finger
 E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was measured via luciferase activity assay.
 Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot
 was to examine levels of miR-205 and related factors. We found that AP
 suppressed cell activity and colony formation, whereas induced apoptosis in
 SH-SY5Y cells. Besides, AP also suppressed Epithelial-mesenchymal transition
 process and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and
 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signal passageways.
 Additionally, miR-205 was positively regulated by AP. AP played its antitumor
 functions through up-regulating miR-205. Target of miR-205 was ZEB1. Our
 study demonstrated that AP played its antitumor role in NB through positively
 regulation of miR-205, whose target gene was ZEB1.",
