    abstract "BACKGROUND: Studies found circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs
 (miRNAs) are abnormally expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Cancer process
 might be modulated by circRNA-miRNA node. Here, we focused on
 hsa_circ_0003645 and miR-1299. METHODS: RT-qPCR was used to examine
 hsa_circ_0003645 and miR-1299 in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cells.
 Hsa_circ_0003645 and miR-1299 were regulated by transfection. The phenotypes
 of hepatocellular carcinoma cells were evaluated through cell viability,
 colony, apoptosis, migration and invasion, and proteins associated with
 apoptosis and motility. Targeting relationship between hsa_circ_0003645 and
 miR-1299 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Changes in
 signaling transduction were monitored by Western blot. RESULTS:
 Hsa_circ_0003645 was notably enhanced in patients with hepatocellular
 carcinoma tissues and (Huh7 and SK-HEP-1) cells. Silencing hsa_circ_0003645
 blocked the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by inhibiting colony
 formation, inducing apoptosis, impeding migration and invasion, promoting the
 expression of apoptosis-associated proteins, and decreasing the expression of
 motility-relevant proteins. miR-1299 was targeted by hsa_circ_0003645 and
 upregulated by silencing hsa_circ_0003645. miR-1299 deficiency reversed the
 role of hsa_circ_0003645 silence in growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells
 and signaling transduction of PI3K/mTOR pathway. CONCLUSION: Silencing
 hsa_circ_0003645 buffered the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
 miR-1299 was responsible for the role of hsa_circ_0003645 silence.",
