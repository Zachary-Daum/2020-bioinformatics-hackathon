    abstract "HRas mutation rate is high in gastric cancer while the deep
 mechanism of HRas's oncogenic effects is unclear. The current work designed
 to link HRas signaling with H1.4S27ph in gastric cancer to decode the unclear
 mechanism in epigenetics standpoint. Ras(Q61R/T35S) expressing plasmids were
 transfected into SNU-16 cells. Western blot was conducted to check H1.4S27ph
 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) expression.
 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide, colony
 formation, and transwell assays were carried out to see the effects of
 H1.4S27ph on SNU-16 cells phenotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was
 utilized to detect the interaction between H1.4S27ph and Ras downstream
 genes. Further, the enzymes responsible for H1.4S27 phosphorylation were
 studied by a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and
 western blot. Ras mutation repressed H1.4 phosphorylation at Ser27
 accompanied by ERK1/2 activation. H1.4S27ph reduced SNU-16 cells viability,
 colony formation, and migration. Meanwhile, H1.4S27ph regulated the
 transcription of Ras downstream genes. Ras-ERK1/2 signaling inhibited
 H1.4S27ph via inhibiting the activity of Aurora B. Aurora B exhibited
 H1.4S27ph-like effects on inhibiting SNU-16 cells viability, migration, and
 S-phase arrest. Further, Ras-ERK1/2 signaling degenerated Aurora B via
 mediating MDM2. H1.4S27ph worked as an anti-gastric cancer factor. It can be
 inhibited by activation of Ras-ERK1/2 signaling. Ras-ERK1/2 signaling
 repressed H1.4S27ph via MDM2-dependent degradation of Aurora B.",
