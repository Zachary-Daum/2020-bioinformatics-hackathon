    abstract "Background: Prostate cancer (PC) fearfully impacts men's health.
 We explored the efficacy and mechanism of circular RNA circZNF609
 (circZNF609) on colony formation, viability, apoptosis, migration and
 invasion and in PC cells. Methods: Colony formation, CCK-8, flow cytometry,
 migration and invasion assay were respectively used to detect the functions
 of circZNF609 and microRNA (miR)-186-5p on cell colony ability, viability,
 apoptosis, migration and invasion. circZNF609 and miR-186-5p expression were
 changed by cell transfection and tested by RT-qPCR. Moreover,
 Cleaved-Caspase-3, Cleaved-Caspase-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9),
 Vimentin and relate-proteins of cell pathways were examined through Western
 blot. Results: circZNF609 was highly expressed at PC tissues. circZNF609
 declined cell colony ability, viability, migration and invasion and caused
 apoptosis. Furthermore, circZNF609 negatively regulated miR-186-5p,
 miR-186-5p inhibitor could reverse impacts of circZNF609. Finally, circZNF609
 restrained the YAP1 and AMPK pathways by up-regulating miR-186-5p.
 Conclusion: Silencing circZNF609 restrained growth, migration and invasion of
 PC cells by up-regulating miR-186-5p via YAP1 and AMPK pathways. Highlights
 circZNF609 is highly expressed in PC tissues; circZNF609 restrains cell
 growth, migration and invasion; circZNF609 exerts its function by
 up-regulating miR-186-5p; circZNF609 exerts its function by YAP1 and AMPK
 signaling pathways.",
