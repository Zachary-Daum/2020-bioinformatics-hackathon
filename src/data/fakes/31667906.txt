    abstract "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a systemic disease and one
 classical type of total DM. Bilobalide (BB) is constituted of EGb 761. Our
 purpose was identifying the role of BB in TIDM in the current study. MIN6
 cells were treated by TNF-alpha; then, viability, apoptosis, and insulin
 secretion were assessed by performing Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow
 cytometry, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assay, and western blot. The
 effects of BB were assessed to identify its function. Further, the above
 mentioned parameters were reassessed when silencing miR-153. TNF-alpha
 declined viability and insulin secretion as well as raised apoptosis and
 inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in MIN6 cells. BB
 alleviated the apoptosis and dysfunction induced by TNF-alpha. MiR-153
 expression was elevated by BB when induced by TNF-alpha. Increase of
 viability and insulin secretion as well as decline of apoptosis and iNOS
 induced by BB treatment was alleviated by silencing miR-153. The rates of
 p/t-p70S6K, p/t-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p/t-adenosine
 monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were raised by BB and
 suppressed by silencing miR-153 under TNF-alpha induced condition. BB raised
 viability and insulin secretion, declined apoptosis and iNOS expression by
 up-regulating miR-153. Furthermore, BB activated AMPK/mTOR pathway by
 up-regulating miR-153.",
