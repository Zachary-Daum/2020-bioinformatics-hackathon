    abstract "Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is a neoteric phytoestrogen extracted
 from Panax notoginseng, and possesses comprehensive pharmacological functions
 in multitudinous ailments. But, whether NGR1 is utilized in neonatal
 pneumonia is not clear. This research study aspired to disclose the
 protective activity of NGR1 in neonatal pneumonia. WI-38 cells were
 co-stimulated with NGR1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 ng/mL), CCK-8 and
 flow cytometry assays were implemented for cell viability and apoptosis
 assessment. Real-time quantitative plymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR),
 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot analysis were
 executed for inflammatory cytokine determination. MicroRNA-181a (miR-181a)
 expression was evaluated through RT-qPCR, simultaneously, the impact of
 miR-181a was estimated in NGR1 and LPS co-managed cells. Dual luciferase
 report assay was performed to disclose the relation between miR-181a and
 Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and
 TAK1/JNK pathways were ultimately appraised. We found that NGR1 decreased
 cell viability, evoked apoptosis and impeded interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta),
 IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression and secretions
 in LPS-managed WI-38 cells. MiR-181a expression was enhanced by NGR1, and
 miR-181a inhibition inverted the impacts of NGR1 in LPS-managed WI-38 cells.
 Besides, TLR4 was predicted to be a firsthand direct target of miR-181a.
 Furthermore, NGR1 hindered NF-kappaB and TAK1/JNK pathways through modulating
 TLR4. These discoveries disclosed the fact that NGR1 protected WI-38 cells
 against LPS-triggered injury via adjusting the miR-181a/TLR4 and NF-kappaB
 and TAK1/JNK pathways.",
