    abstract "The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib is used in therapy
 for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the therapeutic efficacy of
 gefitinib is known to be impeded by mutations of EGFR. The aim of the present
 study was to reveal the role of miR-135a in gefitinib resistance of NSCLC
 cells. Human NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H1650 and NCI-H1975, were transfected with
 miR-135a mimic/inhibitor or miR-135a inhibitor plus pEX-RAC1 (a
 RAC1-expressing vector). The effects of miR-135a and RAC1 expression on cell
 viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were then detected. The
 transfected cells were exposed to 0-20 muM gefitinib, and cell viability was
 then detected at 48 h posttreatment. Western blot analysis was performed to
 detect the expression changes of main factors in the PI3K/AKT pathway.
 miR-135a overexpression promoted viability, migration, and invasion, but
 inhibited apoptosis of NCI-H1650 and NCI-H1975 cells. Cell viability was
 significantly reduced by gefitinib, and the LC50 values of gefitinib in
 NCI-H1650 and NCI-H1795 cells were 0.845 and 0.667 muM, respectively.
 miR-135a overexpression could increase cell viability even under high
 concentrations of gefitinib. Rac1 was not predicted as a target of miR-135a,
 while miR-135a could upregulate the expression of RAC1. miR-135a promoted
 cell growth and metastasis and activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via a
 RAC1-dependent manner. To conclude, this study demonstrated that miR-135a
 confers NSCLC cell resistance to gefitinib via upregulation of RAC1.
 Therapies designed to downregulate miR-135a may help NSCLC patients to
 overcome gefitinib resistance.",
