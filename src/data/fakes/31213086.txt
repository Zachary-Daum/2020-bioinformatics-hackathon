    abstract "Colon cancer, also known as colorectal carcinoma (CRC), remains
 to be one of the most mainsprings of cancer-produced deaths entire world. We
 planned to grab the role and possible biological cause of a long noncoding
 RNA, namely, small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15), in CRC. The mRNA
 level of SNHG15 in CRC tissues and cells was detected, followed by
 investigating the impacts of the depression of SNHG15 on CRC cell
 proliferation (viability and colony-forming), apoptosis, migration, and
 invasion. Moreover, the association between SNHG15 and miR-141 and the
 correlation between miR-141 and SIRT1 were also explored. Besides, the
 influences of dysregulated SNHG15 on the Wnt/beta-catenin signal-related
 proteins were determined. SNHG15 was highly expressed in CRC tissues and
 cells. Depression of SNHG15 depressed proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and
 repressed the migration and invasion of CRC cells. In addition, SNHG15
 presented a downside tendency on regulating miR-141, and the miR-141
 inhibitor dramatically changeover the impacts of SNHG15 depression on tumor
 growth and metastasis. Moreover, SIRT1 was verified as a functional target of
 miR-141 in CRC cells. Besides, the suppression of SNHG15 remarkably
 controlled activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signals, which was reversed after
 inhibiting miR-141 at the same time. The investigated results in this
 research revealed that the increased expression of SNHG15 may enhance the
 process of CRC by acting as a ceRNA in regulating SIRT1 expression by
 sponging miR-141. Thus we propose that Wnt/beta-catenin signals may be a
 downriver regulator in mediating the impacts of SNHG15 in CRC and
 SNHG15-miR-141-SIRT1 axis may pave a new sight in explaining the biological
 processes of CRC.",
