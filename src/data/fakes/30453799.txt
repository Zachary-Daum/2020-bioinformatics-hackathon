    abstract "Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) has become a troublesome
 disease for elder men. Triptolide (TPL) has been reported to be a potential
 anticancer agent. However, the potential effects of TPL on BPH have not been
 shown out. BPH-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of TPL
 and/or transfected with microRNA-218 (miR-218) inhibitor, pc-survivin,
 sh-survivin, or their corresponding controls (NC). Thereafter, cell viability
 was determined by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration was accessed by modified
 two-chamber migration assay. Cell apoptosis was checked by propidium iodide
 (PI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Annexin V staining. In
 addition, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were detected using
 quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot
 analysis, respectively. BPH-1 cell viability and migration were significantly
 decreased, while cell apoptosis and expression of miR-218 were statistically
 enhanced by TPL ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). However, downregulation of miR-218
 increased cell viability and migration, while decreased cell apoptosis
 compared with the negative control group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).
 Furthermore, the expression of cell cycle-related proteins and cell
 apoptosis-related proteins were also led to the opposite results with NC. In
 addition, we found that miR-218 negatively regulated the expression of
 survivin ( P < 0.01) and suppression of survivin significantly enhanced cell
 apoptosis ( P < 0.01). Moreover, the results demonstrated that TPL could
 inactivate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, while inhibition of
 miR-218 alleviated the effects. TPL inhibits viability and migration of BPH-1
 cells and induces cell apoptosis and also inactivates mTOR signal pathway via
 upregulation of miR-218. This study provides evidence for the further studies
 representing triptolide as a potential agent in the treatment of human BPH.",
