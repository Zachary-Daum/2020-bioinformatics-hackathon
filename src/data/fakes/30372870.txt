    abstract "BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a fatal complication induced
 by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). As the current therapeutic approaches
 for LN are not a permanent cure, we studied the potential therapeutic effects
 of alkannin (ALK) on LPS-treated human proximal tubular cells (HK-2 cells),
 aiming to find novel therapeutic drugs for LN treatment. METHODS: Cell
 viability, apoptotic cells, expression of p53 and proteins associated with
 apoptosis, and release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in LPS-treated HK-2 cells were
 measured by using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry assay, Western blot analysis
 and RT-qPCR/ELISA, respectively. Effects of ALK on LPS-treated HK-2 cells
 were evaluated, and miR-210 expression was determined by RT-qPCR. Afterwards,
 whether ALK affected LPS-treated cells via regulating miR-210 was verified,
 and the involvements of the NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways were finally
 studied using Western blot analysis. RESULTS: LPS-induced decrease of cell
 viability, increase of apoptosis, and release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were
 attenuated by ALK treatment. We found miR-210 level in LPS-treated cells was
 elevated by ALK, and miR-210 inhibition could effectively reverse the effects
 of ALK on LPS-treated cells. Moreover, we found the phosphorylation levels of
 key kinases in the NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways were reduced by ALK via
 up-regulating miR-210 in LPS-treated cells. CONCLUSION: ALK attenuated
 LPS-induced inflammatory injury in HK-2 cells possibly through up-regulating
 miR-210. The LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways was
 attenuated by ALK via regulation of miR-210.",
