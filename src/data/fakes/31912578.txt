    abstract "BACKGROUND: Neonatal pneumonia (NP) has a high fatality rate in
 neonatal illness. This research investigated the functions of emodin on
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked inflammatory injury in WI-38 cells. METHODS:
 Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry were utilized for
 examining the impacts of LPS and emodin on viability and apoptosis,
 respectively. Taurine up-regulated gene 1 (TUG1) level was altered through
 cell transfection and investigated by reverse transcription quantitative
 polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, RT-qPCR, western blot and
 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were utilized for investigating
 expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin
 (IL)-6. Western blot was carried out for investigating the levels of Bcl-2,
 Bax, pro-Caspase-3, cleaved-Caspase-3 and NF-kappaB and p38MAPK
 pathway-related proteins. RESULTS: LPS treatment restrained cell viability,
 enhanced apoptosis, and expressions of inflammation-related IL-6 and MCP-1.
 Emodin alleviated LPS-evoked inflammatory injury and restrained the NF-kappaB
 and p38MAPK pathways. Furthermore, emodin positively regulated TUG1
 expression and TUG1 silencing could reverse the efficacy of emodin on IL-6
 and MCP-1 expressions. Finally, TUG1 regulates the expression of inflammatory
 factors through NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways. CONCLUSION: Emodin alleviated
 LPS-evoked inflammatory injury by raising TUG1 expression via NF-kappaB and
 p38MAPK pathways in WI-38 cells.",
