    abstract "Osteoarthritis is one of the most common joint diseases and is
 characterized by joint inflammation. MicroRNAs (miRNA) play an important role
 in osteoarthritis. In this study, we examined the role of miR-301a in
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cells. LPS at 10
 microg/mL concentration was used to induce inflammatory injury in
 chondrogenic cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to measure cell
 viability and flow cytometry was used to measure cell apoptosis. Effect of
 miR-301a on concentrations of inflammatory cytokines was measured using
 ELISA, and on mRNA expressions was measured using qRT-PCR. The miR-301 target
 was identified by luciferase reporter assay. Western blot analysis was used
 to measure the expressions of apoptotic proteins, Sirt1, and PI3K/AKT and
 NF-kappaB pathways proteins. Treatment with LPS decreased cell viability, and
 increased apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and
 TNF-alpha) level, and miR-301a expression. Overexpression of miR-301a
 aggravated the effects of LPS on the chondrogenic cells and the inflammatory
 cytokines by negatively regulating Sirt1 expression. Sirt1 was identified as
 a target of miR-301. Suppression of miR-301a showed the opposite effects.
 Western blot showed that suppression of miR-301a increased the expression of
 PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways proteins. Suppression of miR-301a expression
 alleviated LPS-induced chondrogenic cell injury by upregulating Sirt1 and
 activating the PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB signal pathways.",
