    abstract "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still an unresolved source
 of tumor-related death internationally. Current studies have discovered that
 microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with diverse cancers development, including
 NSCLC. Our paper focused on the functional character of miR-4286 in NSCLC.
 miR-4286 level in 68 cases of NSCLC tissues, matched neighboring nontumor
 tissues and different cancer cell lines were inspected by quantitative
 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The connection
 concerning miR-4286 expression and clinicopathological features of patients
 with NSCLC were further determined. After knockdown or overexpression of
 miR-4286, cell viability, cell cycle, and/or apoptotic cells were examined by
 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow
 cytometry assay, respectively. Moreover, the cell cycle- and
 apoptosis-related proteins were estimated by qRT-PCR and Western blot. In
 comparison with the matched nontumor tissues, miR-4286 was significantly
 enhanced in lung malignancy tissues and different cell lines. miR-4286
 expression was related with the tumor-node-metastasis stage, lymphatic
 metastasis, and distant metastasis. Cell viability was ominously weakened by
 suppression of miR-4286 in A549 cells, whereas was statistically upregulated
 by overexpression of miR-4286 in NCI-H1299 cells. Additionally, we detected
 that suppression of miR-4286 tempted cell cycle arrest in G1 stage and
 fortified apoptosis in A549 cells. Runx3 was recognized as one target gene of
 miR-4286, and the impacts of suppression of miR-4286 on cell viability and
 apoptosis were through regulation of Runt-related transcription factor 3. Our
 study suggests that miR-4286 overexpression represents a tumor promoter role
 in NSCLC cells.",
