    abstract "Objectives: Recent studies revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) may
 play crucial roles in the responses and pathologic processes of spinal cord
 injury (SCI). This study aimed to investigate the effect and the molecular
 basis of miR-103 on LPS-induced injuries in PC12 cells in vitro and SCI rats
 in vivo. Materials and Methods: PC12 cells were exposed to LPS to induce cell
 injuries to mimic the in vitro model of SCI. The expression of miR-103 and
 SOX2 in PC12 cells were altered by transient transfections. Cell viability
 and apoptotic cell rate were measured by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry
 assay. Furthermore, Western blot analysis was performed to detect the
 expression levels of apoptosis- and autophagy- related proteins, MAPK/ERK
 pathway- and JAK/STAT pathway-related proteins. In addition, we also assessed
 the effect of miR-103 agomir on SCI rats. Results: LPS exposure induced cell
 injuries in PC12 cells. miR-103 overexpression significantly increased cell
 viability, reduced cell apoptosis and autophagy, and opposite results were
 observed in miR-103 inhibition. miR-103 attenuated LPS-induced injuries by
 indirect upregulation of SOX2. SOX2 overexpression protected PC12 cells
 against LPS-induced injuries, while SOX2 inhibition expedited LPS-induced
 cell injuries. Furthermore, miR-103 overexpression inhibited MAPK/ERK pathway
 and JAK/STAT pathway through upregulation of SOX2. We also found that miR-103
 agomir inhibited cell apoptosis and autophagy in SCI rats. Conclusion: This
 study demonstrates that miR-103 may represent a protective effect against
 cell apoptosis and autophagy in LPS-injured PC12 cells and SCI rats by
 upregulation of SOX2 expression.",
