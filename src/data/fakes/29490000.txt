    abstract "Propofol is an intravenous sedative hypnotic agent of which the
 growth-inhibitory effect has been reported on various cancers. However, the
 roles of propofol in endometrial cancer (EC) remain unclear. This study aimed
 to explore the effects of propofol on EC in vitro and in vivo. Different
 concentrations of propofol were used to treat Ishikawa cells. Colony number,
 cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were analyzed
 by colony formation, MTT, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays. In addition,
 the pcDNA3.1-Sox4 and Sox4 siRNA plasmids were transfected into Ishikawa
 cells to explore the relationship between propofol and Sox4 in EC cell
 proliferation. Tumor weight in vivo was measured by xenograft tumor model
 assay. Protein levels of cell cycle-related factors, apoptosis-related
 factors, matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9), matrix metalloproteinases 2
 (MMP2) and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were examined by western blot. Results
 showed that propofol significantly decreased colony numbers, inhibited cell
 viability, migration, and invasion but promoted apoptosis in a dose-dependent
 manner in Ishikawa cells. Moreover, propofol reduced the expression of Sox4
 in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, propofol significantly suppressed
 the proportions of Ki67+ cells, but Sox4 overexpression reversed the results.
 Furthermore, in vivo assay results showed that propofol inhibited tumor
 growth; however, the inhibitory effect was abolished by Sox4 overexpression.
 Moreover, propofol inhibited Sox4 expression via inactivation of
 Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway. Our study demonstrated that propofol
 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion but promoted apoptosis
 by regulation of Sox4 in EC cells. These findings might indicate a novel
 treatment strategy for EC.",
