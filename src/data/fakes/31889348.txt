    abstract "Long noncoding RNA myocardial infarction-associated transcript 2
 (lncRNA Mirt2) is a burgeoning lncRNA, its anti-inflammatory capacity has
 been testified. Nonetheless, the functions of Mirt2 in immunoglobulin A
 nephropathy are unexplored. We tried to impart the influences of Mirt2 in
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked HK-2 cells damage. HK-2 cells were
 manipulated with 10 ng/ml LPS, next cell viability, apoptosis, reactive
 oxygen species (ROS) generation, pro-inflammatory factors and Mirt2
 expression were evaluated. After pc-Mirt2 vector transfection, the
 aforementioned trials were performed. Meanwhile, real-time quantitative
 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiment was used to detect miR-126
 expression. Subsequently, functions of miR-126 in LPS-treated HK-2 cells were
 further delved after transfection with miR-126 mimic. Western blot was used
 to evaluate NF-kappaB pathway. The data showed that LPS invoked HK-2 cells
 inflammatory damage via the suppression of cell viability and the
 acceleration of apoptosis, ROS level, and IL-1beta and IL-6 secretion. LPS
 inhibited Mirt2 expression and overexpression of Mirt2 mitigated LPS-caused
 inflammatory damage in HK-2 cells. Additionally, overexpression of Mirt2
 repressed miR-126 expression in LPS-stimulated cells. Meanwhile the
 anti-inflammatory effect of Mirt2 was inverted by upregulating miR-126
 expression. Besides, overexpressed Mirt2 retarded LPS-activated NF-kappaB
 pathway via repressing miR-126. The research certified the anti-inflammatory
 impacts of Mirt2 on LPS-impaired HK-2 cells.",
