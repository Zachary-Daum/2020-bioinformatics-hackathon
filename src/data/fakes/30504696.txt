    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Radix notoginseng is a well-known traditional
 Chinese herbal medicine, has extensively pharmacological activities in
 cardiovascular system. Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is one main active
 ingredient of Radix notoginseng. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
 the functional effects of NGR1 on atherosclerosis (AS). METHODS: Human
 umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to oxidized low
 density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), before which cells were preconditioned with
 NGR1. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assay,
 quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot
 were carried out to assess the impacts of ox-LDL and NGR1 on HUVECs. Besides,
 the expression of microRNA-132 (miR-132), and the regulatory role of miR-132
 in Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) expression were measured by qRT-PCR and Western
 blot. RESULTS: NGR1 pre-conditioning prevented ox-LDL-induced apoptosis,
 migration and overproduction of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 (MCP-1)
 and Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). miR-132 was up-regulated in
 response to ox-LDL while was down-regulated by NGR1 pre-conditioning. The
 protective actions of NGR1 in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs were enhanced by miR-132
 inhibitor, while were attenuated by miR-132 mimic. Besides, the up-regulated
 miR-132 could further decrease the expression of MGP, which acted as an
 anti-migratory and anti-adhesive factor. Furthermore, ox-LDL-induced the
 activation of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and Nuclear Factor Kappa B
 (NF-kappaB) pathways were partially attenuated by NGR1, and were fully
 eliminated by NGR1 treatment together with MGP overexpression. CONCLUSION:
 NGR1 prevents ox-LDL-induced apoptosis, migration and adhesion-related
 molecule release in HUVECs possibly via down-regulating miR-132, and
 subsequent up-regulating MGP.",
