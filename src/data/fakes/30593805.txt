    abstract "Pancreatic cancer is a common and lethal cancer in digestive
 system. This study investigated the potential oncogenic effects of lncRNA
 HULC on pancreatic cancer. Briefly, qRT-PCR was conducted to measure the
 expression of HULC and miR-15a in pancreatic tissues and cells. Cell
 transfection was used to change the expression of HULC and miR-15a in
 pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells. The viability, migration and invasion and
 apoptosis of Panc-1 cells after relevant transfection were detected using
 CCK-8 assay, two chamber transwell assay and Guava Nexin assay, respectively.
 Results found that HULC had a higher expression level, while miR-15a had a
 lower expression level in pancreatic cancer tissues. Overexpression of HULC
 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of Panc-1 cells.
 Suppression of HULC had opposite effects and dramatically induced cell
 apoptosis. Moreover, HULC negatively regulated the expression of miR-15a in
 Panc-1 cells. miR-15a participated in the effects of HULC on Panc-1 cells.
 Furthermore, overexpression of HULC activated PI3K/AKT pathway in Panc-1
 cells by down-regulating miR-15a. In conclusion, HULC exerted oncogenic role
 in pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of HULC promoted the proliferation,
 migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by down-regulating miR-15a
 and then activating PI3K/AKT pathway.",
