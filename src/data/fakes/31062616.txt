    abstract "Salidroside (Sal) exerted widely pharmacological effects in
 multitudinous diseases had been certified. The actual study clarified the
 protective activity of Sal in H2O2-injured human trabecular meshwork (HTM)
 cells. HTM cells were disposed with H2O2 to construct an oxidative damage
 model in vitro. Then, Sal was utilized to administrate HTM cells, and cell
 viability, apoptosis, apoptosis-interrelated proteins and ROS production were
 appraised using CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot and DCFH-DA staining.
 MiR-27a inhibitor and its control were transfected into HTM cells, and the
 influences of miR-27a inhibition in HTM cells stimulated with H2O2 and Sal
 were detected. PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were ultimately
 investigated to uncover the underlying mechanism. We found that H2O2 evoked
 HTM cells oxidative damage, as evidenced by repressing cell viability,
 inducing apoptosis, activating cleaved-caspase-3/-9 expression and increasing
 ROS production. Sal significantly lightened H2O2-evoked oxidative damage in
 HTM cells. Additionally, miR-27a was up-regulated by Sal, and miR-27a
 suppression significantly reversed the protective effect of Sal on
 H2O2-injured HTM cells. Finally, Sal activated PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin
 pathways through enhancement of miR-27a in H2O2-injured HTM cells. In
 conclusion, these discoveries suggested that Sal could protect HTM cells
 against H2O2-evoked oxidative damage by activating PI3K/AKT and
 Wnt/beta-catenin pathways through enhancement of miR-27a. Highlights H2O2
 evokes HTM cells oxidative damage; Sal relieves H2O2-induced oxidative damage
 in HTM cells; Sal enhances miR-27a expression in H2O2-injured HTM cells;
 Repressed miR-27a reverses the protective impacts of Sal on H2O2-injured HTM
 cells; Sal activates PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways by increasing
 miR-27a.",
