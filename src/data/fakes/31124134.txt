    abstract "Tumor suppressor long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3
 (lncRNA MEG3) exists in various cancers. Nonetheless, the functions of lncRNA
 MEG3 in choriocarcinoma (CC) are still not well studied. We explored the
 effects of lncRNA MEG3 on human CC JEG-3 and BeWo cells. lncRNA MEG3 was
 overexpressed, and the effects of lncRNA MEG3 on cell viability,
 proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed by the cell
 counting kit-8 assay, western blot analysis, flow cytometry (plus western
 blot analysis), and transwell assay (plus western blot analysis),
 respectively. Then, the expression level of miR-211 was detected by real-time
 quantitative polymerase chain reaction. After that, the effects of
 dysregulated microRNA-211 (miR-211) with overexpressing lncRNA MEG3 on JEG-3
 cells and BeWo cells were testified. Western blot analysis was used to study
 the involvements of the signaling pathways in the lncRNA MEG3-associated
 modulation. We found that lncRNA MEG3 upregulation reduced cell viability,
 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis.
 Expression of miR-211 was upregulated after lncRNA MEG3 overexpression.
 Effects of lncRNA MEG3 overexpression were augmented by miR-211
 overexpression, while they were declined by miR-211 silencing. Phosphorylated
 levels of PI3K, AKT, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were decreased
 by lncRNA MEG3 overexpression via regulation of miR-211. To sum up, lncRNA
 MEG3 could repress proliferation, migration and invasion, and promote
 apoptosis of JEG-3 and BeWo cells through upregulating miR-211. The PI3K/AKT
 and AMPK pathways were inhibited by lncRNA MEG3 overexpression via regulation
 of miR-211.",
