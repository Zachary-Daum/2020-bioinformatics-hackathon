    abstract "Tripterine, also known as celastrol, is a main natural
 ingredient in Tripterygium wilfordii. Tripterine has a variety of
 pharmacological functions, and the therapeutic potential of tripterine in
 many kinds of inflammation-linked diseases has been revealed. However, the
 function of tripterine on osteoarthritis still remains unclear. The objective
 of this study was to study the function of tripterine (TPR) on
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injured chondrocyte. ATDC5 cells were treated with
 tripterine after LPS stimulation and then cell survival, the release of
 pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of chondrogenic
 differentiation-associated proteins were assessed by performing CCK-8, flow
 cytometry, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction
 (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot.
 Moreover, the expression of miR-223 and core factors in PI3K/AKT and nuclear
 factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling was tested by RT-qPCR/Western blot. LPS
 stimulation significantly reduced ATDC5 cells viability, induced apoptosis,
 and increased the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor
 (TNF)-alpha. Tripterine protected ATDC5 cells against LPS-induced chondrocyte
 loss and the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. miR-223 was down-regulated by
 LPS, while was up-regulated by tripterine. The protective actions of
 tripterine were eliminated when miR-223 was silenced. Besides, tripterine
 inhibited hypertrophic differentiation induced by LPS, and the inhibitory
 effects of tripterine on hypertrophic differentiation could be abolished when
 miR-223 was silenced. Furthermore, tripterine activated PI3K/AKT pathway and
 deactivated NF-kappaB pathway. And the regulatory effects of tripterine on
 these two pathways were abolished by miR-223 silence. This study revealed
 that tripterine protected ATDC5 cells against LPS-induced cell damage
 possibly via up-regulation of miR-223 and modulation of NF-kappaB and
 PI3K/AKT pathways.",
