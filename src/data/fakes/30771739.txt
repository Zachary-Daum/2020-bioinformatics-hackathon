    abstract "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a conversant joint disease, which
 seriously threatens the health of the elderly, and even leads to disability.
 Long non-coding RNA-activated by transforming growth factor beta (lncRNA-ATB)
 has been reported in diverse cancers. However, the functions of lncRNA-ATB in
 OA remain uninvestigated. The current study aimed to explore the impacts of
 lncRNA-ATB on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury in ATDC5
 cells and to uncover the underlying mechanism. LPS-induced ATDC5 cell injury
 model was constructed, and the effects of lncRNA-ATB on LPS-injured cells
 were explored via analyzing cell viability, apoptosis, iNOS, COX-2, and
 inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha). Subsequently, the relationship
 between lncRNA-ATB and microRNA (miR)-223 was detected, and whether miR-223
 was involved in modulating LPS-induced cells injury in ATDC5 cells was
 investigated. Finally, MyD88/NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways were assessed to
 explore the underlying mechanism. Results showed that LPS repressed cell
 viability, induced apoptosis, and promoted iNOS, COX-2, IL-6 and TNF-alpha
 expression. Additionally, we observed that lncRNA-ATB expression was
 down-regulated in LPS-injured cells, and lncRNA-ATB overexpression
 significantly alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury in ATDC5 cells.
 Interesting results revealed that miR-223 expression was down-regulated by
 lncRNA-ATB and miR-223 overexpression declined the protective effect of
 lncRNA-ATB on LPS-injured ATDC5 cells. Further, the signaling pathway
 experiments showed that lncRNA-ATB inhibited MyD88/NF-kappaB and p38MAPK
 pathways by down-regulating miR-223 in LPS-injured cells. These data
 demonstrated that lncRNA-ATB protected ATDC5 cells against LPS-induced
 inflammatory injury by repressing MyD88/NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways, which
 was mediated by down-regulation of miR-223.",
