    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: LncRNA GAS5, a growth suppressor, has been
 reported to exert anti-tumor actions in various cancers, whereas the exact
 mechanism underling the anti-tumor action is still unclear. This study was
 aimed to investigate the effect of lncRNA GAS5 on osteosarcoma and tried to
 decode the underling mechanisms. METHODS: Expressions of lncRNA GAS5 in MG-63
 cells were silenced by shRNA transfection, while were overexpressed by vector
 transfection. Cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis were
 respectively assessed by MTT, Transwell assay and flow cytometry. Regulations
 between lncRNA GAS5 and miR-203a, as well as between miR-203a and TIMP2 were
 detected by qPCR, western blot and dual luciferase activity assay. RESULTS:
 LncRNA GAS5 was down-regulated in MG-63 and OS-732 cells compared to hFOB1.19
 cells. Silence of lncRNA GAS5 significantly promoted MG-63 cells viability,
 migration and invasion, and up-regulated Cyclin D1, Cyclin B1, CDK1 and CDK4
 expressions. miR-203a was negatively regulated by lncRNA GAS5. The promoting
 activities of lncRNA GAS5 silence on MG-63 cells growth and metastasis were
 reversed by miR-203a suppression. TIMP2 was a target of miR-203a and the
 anti-growth and anti-metastasis actions of miR-203a suppression were reversed
 by TIMP2 silence. Further, lncRNA GAS5 silence, miR-203a overexpression, and
 TIMP2 silence could activate PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta signaling while block
 NF-kappaB signaling. CONCLUSION: LncRNA GAS5 might be a tumor suppressor in
 osteosarcoma via sponging miR-203a, sequestering miR-203a away from TIMP2.",
