    abstract "Myocarditis is a common heart disease which lacks effective
 treatment till now. Baicalin possesses plenty of activities, including
 anti-inflammation. In this investigation, we attempted to investigate the
 influences of Baicalin on Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked H9c2 cells.Cells
 viability, apoptosis, and expressions of apoptosis-associated proteins were,
 respectively, measured utilizing CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry and western
 blot. The levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were detected through enzyme-linked
 immunosorbent assay, western blot and qRT-PCR. miR-21 expression was detected
 through qRT-PCR and was silenced using cell transfection. The expressions of
 NF-kappaB and PDCD4/JNK pathways related proteins were measured through
 western blot. We found that LPS stimulation induced cell apoptosis and
 upregulation of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Baicalin treatment effectively suppressed
 LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis. The NF-kappaB and PDCD4/JNK pathways
 were blocked by Baicalin. Additionally, the enhanced expression of miR-21
 triggered by LPS was further elevated by Baicalin. Further study revealed
 that the inhibiting effects of Baicalin on LPS-evoked injury were largely
 attenuated by knockdown of miR-21. Moreover, the associated NF-kappaB and JNK
 pathways, which were suppressed by Baicalin treatment, were then activated by
 knockdown of miR-21. Our present study revealed that Baicalin alleviated
 LPS-evoked inflammatory injury via suppressing the NF-kappaB and PDCD4/JNK
 pathways through regulating miR-21 expression.",
