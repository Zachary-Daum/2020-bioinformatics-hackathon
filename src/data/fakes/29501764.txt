    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that Sinomenine
 (SIN) exerted anti-inflammatory effect in various immune-related diseases.
 However, the effect of SIN on glucocorticoids dermatitis has not been
 investigated. In our study, we aimed to explore the effect of SIN on
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury in HaCaT cells.
 MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed an inflammatory injury model of
 LPS-induced HaCaT cells, then SIN was added to LPS-treated cells, cell
 viability, apoptosis, apoptosis-associated factors and inflammatory cytokines
 were detected by CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot, qRT-PCR and ELISA.
 Subsequently, miR-101 mimic and mimic control were transfected into HaCaT
 cells to investigate the effect of SIN and miR-101 on LPS-induced cells
 injury. Furthermore, MKP-1 and JNK signal pathways were measured by qRT-PCR
 and western blot. Finally, the animal experiment was performed to further
 clarify the effect of SIN on inflammatoty injury. RESULTS: LPS suppressed
 cell viability, promoted apoptosis and increased IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha
 expressions and secretions in HaCaT cells. SIN significantly alleviated
 LPS-induced HaCaT cells injury. Additionally, SIN down-regulated miR-101
 expression, and the protective effect of SIN on LPS-induced inflammatory
 injury was abolished by miR-101 overexpression. Besides, SIN promoted MKP-1
 expression by down-regulation of miR-101, and SIN inhibited JNK signal
 pathway by up-regulation of MKP-1 expression in LPS-treated HaCaT cells.
 Animal experiments revealed that SIN exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in
 vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that SIN attenuated LPS-induced
 inflammatory injury by regulation of miR-101, MKP-1 and JNK pathway. These
 findings might provide a novel method for treatment of glucocorticoids
 dermatitis.",
