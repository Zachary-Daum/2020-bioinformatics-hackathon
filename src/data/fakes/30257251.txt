    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a traditional Chinese
 medicine isolated from Astragalus membranaceus, has been shown to exert
 cardioprotective effect previously. This study aimed to reveal the effects of
 AS-IV on hypoxia-injured cardiomyocyte. METHODS: H9c2 cells were treated with
 various doses of AS-IV for 24 h upon hypoxia. CCK-8 assay, flow
 cytometry/Western blot, and qRT-PCR were respectively conducted to measure
 the changes in cell viability, apoptosis, and the expression of miR-23a and
 miR-92a. Sprague-Dawley rats were received coronary ligation, and were
 administrated by various doses of AS-IV for 14 days. The infarct volume and
 outcome of rats followed by ligation were tested by ultrasound,
 arteriopuncture and nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) staining. RESULTS:
 We found that 10 mug/ml of AS-IV exerted myocardioprotective effects against
 hypoxia-induced cell damage, as AS-IV significantly increased H9c2 cells
 viability and decreased apoptosis. Interestingly, the myocardioprotective
 effects of AS-IV were alleviated by miR-23a and/or miR-92a overexpression.
 Knockdown of miR-23a and miR-92a activated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ ERK signaling
 pathways. Bcl-2 was a target gene for miR-23a, and BCL2L2 was a target gene
 for miR-92a. In the animal model of myocardial infarction (MI), AS-IV
 significantly reduced the infarct volume, ejection fraction (EF), shortening
 fraction (FS) and LV systolic pressure (LVSP), and significantly increased
 left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter (LVEDd). And also, the
 elevated expression of miR-23a and miR-92a in MI rat was reduced by AS-IV.
 CONCLUSION: AS-IV protected cardiomyocytes against hypoxia-induced injury
 possibly via down-regulation of miR-23a and miR-92a, and via activation of
 PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways.",
