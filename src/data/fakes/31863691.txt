    abstract "Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3)
 has been identified as a regulatory molecule in angiogenesis. The goal of
 this study was to illustrate how MEG3 affects the angiogenesis of vascular
 endothelial cells. Expression of MEG3, miR-147 and intracellular cell
 adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human microvascular endothelial cell line
 (HMEC-1) was altered by transfection, then cell viability, apoptosis,
 migration, tube formation, as well as the correlation among MEG3, miR-147 and
 ICAM-1 were explored. MEG3 was down-regulated during tube formation of HMEC-1
 cells. MEG3 expression suppressed cells viability, migration and tube
 formation, while it induced apoptosis. MEG3 could bind with miR-147 and
 repress miR-147 expression. MiR-147 induced ICAM-1 expression, and contained
 ICAM-1 target sequences. The anti-atherogenic actions of MEG3 were inhibited
 by miR-147, and the anti-atherogenic actions of miR-147 suppression were also
 inhibited when ICAM-1 was overexpressed. Further, ICAM-1 overexpression
 showed activated roles in Wnt/beta-catenin and Jak/Stat signaling pathways.
 In low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)-/- mice, MEG3 overexpression
 reduced CD68+, CD3+ and ICAM-1 areas in lesions and increased collagen
 content. MEG3 inhibited HMEC-1 cell growth, migration and tube formation. The
 anti-atherogenic actions of MEG3 might be mediated via sponging miR-147, and
 thereby repressing the expression of ICAM-1.",
