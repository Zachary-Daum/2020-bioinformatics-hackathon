    abstract "lncRNA ANRIL was reported to be closely related to ischaemic
 stroke (IS). In this study, we used oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to
 stimulate rat adrenal medulla-derived pheochromocytoma cell line PC-12 to
 construct an in vitro IS cell model and investigated the role of ANRIL and
 the underlying mechanism. PC-12 cells were stimulated by OGD and/or
 transfected with pc-ANRIL, si-ANRIL, miR-127 mimic, miR-127 inhibitor,
 pEX-Mcl-1, sh-Mcl-1 and their negative controls. Cell viability, apoptosis,
 mRNA and protein expression was detected using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry
 assay, qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Results showed that
 OGD-induced PC-12 cell injury and decreased ANRIL expression. ANRIL
 overexpression significantly reduced OGD-induced PC-12 cell injury evidenced
 by increasing cell viability and decreasing apoptosis, while ANRIL silence
 led to the opposite results. Meanwhile, dysregulation of ANRIL altered the
 expression of apoptotic proteins. Furthermore, ANRIL negatively regulated
 miR-127 expression. miR-127 overexpression significantly enhanced OGD-induced
 PC-12 cell injury. In addition, Mcl-1 expression was negatively regulated by
 miR-127, besides ANRIL up-regulated Mcl-1 expression by down-regulation of
 miR-127. Mcl-1 overexpression alleviated cell injury and miR-127 silence
 up-regulated Mcl-1 expression. In conclusion, lncRNA ANRIL alleviated
 OGD-induced PC-12 cell injury as evidenced. PI3K/AKT pathway might be
 involved in this regulating progression.",
