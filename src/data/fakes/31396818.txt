    abstract "Hepatitis has become a major social, health, and economic
 problem worldwide. Herein, we tested the beneficial influence of baicalin, a
 flavonoid extracted from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis, on human
 normal liver L-02 and THLE2 cell apoptosis and inflammatory reaction
 stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and possible molecular mechanisms.
 L-02 and THLE2 cell viability and apoptosis after LPS and/or baicalin
 treatment were tested using CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis kit,
 respectively. qRT-PCR was used to measure the MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and
 lncRNA taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) expressions in L-02 and THLE2 cells.
 sh-TUG1 was transfected to knockdown TUG1. SB203580 was used as inhibitor of
 p38MAPK pathway, while SP600125 was used as inhibitor of JNK pathway. We
 discovered that LPS stimulation caused L-02 and THLE2 cell apoptosis and
 inflammatory reaction. Baicalin relieved the L-02 and THLE2 cell apoptosis
 and inflammatory reaction stimulated by LPS. Moreover, LPS lowered the TUG1
 expression in L-02 cells, while baicalin promoted the TUG1 expression in L-02
 and L-02 and THLE2 cells, as well as inactivated p38MAPK and JNK pathways in
 LPS-stimulated L-02 cells. Besides, knockdown of TUG1 activated p38MAPK and
 JNK pathways and promoted inflammatory cytokine expression in L-02 cells. In
 conclusion, this study further affirmed the beneficial influences of baicalin
 on LPS-stimulated human normal liver cell apoptosis and inflammatory
 reaction. Baicalin relived liver cell inflammation stimulated by LPS might be
 via upregulating TUG1 and then inactivating p38MAPK and JNK pathways.",
