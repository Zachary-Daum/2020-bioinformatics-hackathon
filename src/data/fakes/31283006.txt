    abstract "Epigenetic alterations, especially histone modification, play
 vital roles in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Upregulation of the enhancer
 of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has been reported to contribute to the initiation
 and progression of colon cancer. This study analyzed the association between
 EZH2 and phosphorylation of H2B at tyrosine 37 (H2B(Y37ph) ) in colon cancer
 tissues and cells, along with the influences of the EZH2-H2B(Y37ph) axis on
 colon cancer cell autophagy. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to assess EZH2
 and H2B(Y37ph) expressions in clinical samples of colon cancer. Cell
 transfection was carried out to alter EZH2 and H2B(Y37ph) expressions in
 colon cancer cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis and
 glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull down assay were conducted to analyze the
 association between EZH2 and H2B(Y37ph) . Western blotting was utilized to
 measure proteins expressions related to cell autophagy. We found that there
 was a positive association between EZH2 and H2B(Y37ph) in colon cancer
 tissues and cells. EZH2 directly interacted with H2B and promoted H2B(Y37ph)
 in colon cancer cells using ATP as a phosphate donor. Moreover, EZH2 levated
 colon cancer cell autophagy in starvation condition. H2B(Y37ph) was required
 for EZH2-elevated colon cancer cell autophagy under starvation condition. The
 EZH2-H2B(Y37ph) axis elevated colon cancer cell autophagy possibly via
 activating transcriptional regulation of ATG genes. In conclusion,
 EZH2-elevated colon cancer initiation and progression at least in part via
 inducing colon cancer cell autophagy. EZH2 could phosphorylate H2B(Y37) and
 then induce transcription activation of ATG genes in colon cancer cells under
 starvation condition.",
