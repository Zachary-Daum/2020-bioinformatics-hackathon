    abstract "The limited therapeutic strategies and the unsatisfied prognosis
 for spinal cord injury (SCI) make the identification of innovative
 therapeutic targets for SCI become very urgent. Herein, we explored the role
 of long non-cording RNA taurine up-regulated gene 1 (lncRNA TUG1) in
 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells and studied the downstream
 effector and signaling cascades. We found that LPS-induced decrease of cell
 viability, increase of apoptosis and release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were
 mitigated by TUG1 overexpression. MicroRNA (miR-127) was negatively regulated
 by TUG1. Effects of TUG1 on LPS-treated PC-12 cells were reversed by miR-127
 overexpression. Besides, TUG1 inactivated NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways in
 LPS-treated PC-12 cells via down-regulating miR-127. Dynactin 4 and protein
 tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) were the target genes of miR-127. miR-127
 regulated the NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways in PC-12 cells at least by
 targeting dynactin 4 and PTP. In conclusion, we discovered that TUG1
 alleviated LPS-induced PC-12 cell inflammatory injury might be through
 down-regulating miR-127, influencing dynactin 4 and PTP, and then
 inactivating NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways.",
