    abstract "Immoderate proliferation and deposition of collagen generally
 result in hypertrophic scars and even keloids. microRNA-29 (miR-29) has been
 proved as a crucial regulator in these pathological processes. Although
 mounting evidence have proved baicalein (BAI) impairs scar formation, it is
 still incompletely understood whether miR-29 participated in the underlying
 mechanism. In the present study, NIH-3T3 cells were stimulated with BAI, and
 then cell viability was analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Western
 blot. We further analyzed total soluble collagen, collagen 1, and
 alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in NIH-3T3 cells, which were exposed to
 transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1)/BAI, using a Sircol assay kit,
 quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot,
 respectively. Besides, the miR-29 inhibitor was transduced and its
 transfection efficiency was verified by qRT-PCR. Finally, the phosphorylated
 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase
 (JNK) were examined by Western blot. BAI effectively retarded NIH-3T3
 proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, TGF-beta1-induced
 deposition of total soluble collagen and synthesis of collagen 1 and
 alpha-SMA were repressed by BAI at mRNA and protein levels. However, miR-29
 inhibitor reversed the effects of BAI. Remarkably, BAI promoted
 phosphorylated expression of p38MAPK and JNK while miR-29 inhibitor reversed
 its effects on the phosphorylated expression of p38MAPK and JNK. BAI
 effectively weakened the cell viability and repressed TGF-beta1-induced total
 soluble collagen as well as collagen 1 and alpha-SMA by upregulating miR-29.
 Mechanically, BAI activates the p38MAPK/JNK pathway by promoting miR-29.",
