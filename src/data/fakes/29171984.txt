    abstract "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs
 (miRNAs) are closely related to lung cancer. However, the effects of miR-1246
 on lung cancer are still elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the
 molecular mechanisms of miR-1246 in lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using
 RT-qPCR assay, we analyzed the expression of miR-1246 in lung cancer cell
 lines and lung epithelial cell line. Using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), flow
 cytometry, Transwell, RT-qPCR and western blot assays, we investigated cell
 viability, apoptosis, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)
 process. Using luciferase reporter assay, we confirmed a target of miR-1246.
 Using western blot assay, we detected the protein mechanisms of Janus kinase
 (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and
 phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signal pathways.
 RESULTS: Our results showed that miR-1246 was down-regulated in lung cancer
 cell lines (A549, H1650 and H1299) compared to in lung epithelial cell line
 (16HBE14o). MiR-1246 overexpression remarkably inhibited cell invasion as
 well as up-regulated E-cadherin expression and down-regulated N-cadherin,
 Vimentin, ZEB1 and Snail expressions in A549 cells. Further studies have
 confirmed CXCR4 as a target gene of miR-1246, and CXCR4 silence significantly
 abolished the promotion effect of miR-1246 suppression on cell invasion and
 EMT process in A549 cells. Besides, miR-1246 blocked JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT
 signal pathways by regulation of CXCR4. CONCLUSIONS: These results
 demonstrated that miR-1246 inhibited cell invasion and EMT process by
 targeting CXCR4 and blocking JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT signal pathways in lung
 cancer cells.",
