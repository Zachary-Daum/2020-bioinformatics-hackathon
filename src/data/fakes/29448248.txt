    abstract "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most frequently
 occurring joint disease and characterized by degeneration of cartilage. As
 the unique cell type in cartilage, chondrocytes play a crucial role during
 OA. Our study explored the influence of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) growth
 arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) on lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced
 injury in ATDC5 cells. METHODS: Cell viability, apoptosis and expression of
 inflammatory cytokines were all assessed to evaluate LPS-induce inflammatory
 injury. Expression of GAS5 in LPS-induced cells was evaluated by qRT-PCR.
 After cell transfection, effect of abnormally expressed GAS5 on LPS-induced
 inflammatory injury was determined. Then, the possible target of GAS5 was
 screened by bioinformatics and verified by qRT-PCR and luciferase activity
 assay. Together, whether aberrant expression of target gene affected the
 modulation of GAS5 in LPS-induced inflammatory injury was also assessed.
 Finally, the influences of aberrant expressed Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) on
 nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and Notch pathways were detected by Western
 blot analysis. RESULTS: LPS reduced cell viability and promoted cell
 apoptosis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, along with down-regulation
 of GAS5. LPS-induced injury was alleviated by GAS5 overexpression while was
 exacerbated by GAS5 silence. KLF2 was predicted and verified as a target of
 GAS5, and GAS5 functioned through regulating expression of KLF2. Besides,
 aberrant expression of KLF2 regulated expressions of key kinases involved in
 the NF-kappaB and Notch pathways. CONCLUSION: GAS5 might ameliorate
 LPS-induced inflammatory injury in ATDC5 chondrocytes by inhibiting the
 NF-kappaB and Notch signaling pathways.",
