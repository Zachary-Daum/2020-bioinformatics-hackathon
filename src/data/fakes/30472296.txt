    abstract "AIMS: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a common brain
 injury disease in neonates, which can lead to neonatal disability and death.
 Geniposide (GEN) is a main ingredient of Gardenia jasminoides, whose
 anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects have been reported
 in various diseases. However, the effect of GEN on HIE remains
 uninvestigated. This study aimed to clarify the protective effect of GEN on
 PC-12 cells against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced injury. MAIN
 METHODS: PC-12 cells were subjected to OGD treatment, cell viability, cell
 cycle-associated factors, apoptosis and apoptosis-associated factors were
 then determined. The different concentrations of GEN were used to stimulate
 PC-12 cells, and the effects of GEN on cell proliferation and apoptosis in
 OGD-treatment cells were assessed. Subsequently, relative expression level of
 H19 was analyzed in PC-12 cells after treatment with GEN. After this, si-H19
 was transfected into PC-12 cells to explore the regulatory effect of H19 on
 PC-12 cells after treatment with GEN and OGD. Besides, PI3K/AKT and
 Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were examined by western blot assay. KEY FINDINGS:
 OGD significantly inhibited cell viability, decreased CyclinD1, CDK4 and CDK6
 expression, induced apoptosis and up-regulated Cleaved-Caspase-9/-7/-3
 expression in PC-12 cells. GEN treatment obviously alleviated OGD-induced
 cell injury. Additionally, H19 expression was up-regulated by GEN, and H19
 knockdown reversed the protective effect of GEN on PC-12 cells against
 OGD-induced injury. Finally, GEN activated PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin
 pathways by regulating H19 in OGD-insulted PC-12 cells. SIGNIFICANCE: The
 findings suggested that GEN protected PC-12 cells against OGD-induced injury
 by up-regulation of H19.",
