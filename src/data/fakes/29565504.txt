    abstract "OBJECTIVE: It's of great significance to investigate the novel
 targets of drugs for the treatment of stroke. In this study, we explored the
 neuroprotective role of miR-424 in oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced
 injuries in PC-12 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PC-12 cells were subjected to
 OGD stimulation to mimic ischemic injury. The expressions of miR-424 and
 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) were altered by
 transient transfection with miR-424 mimic, miR-424 inhibitor, pEX-MKP-1, or
 sh-MKP-1. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, and quantitative
 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), were conducted to
 respectively detect cell viability, apoptotic cells, and the expression of
 miR-424 and MKP-1. The protein expressions of several factors were determined
 by Western blot. Meanwhile, relative luciferase activity assay was done to
 verify the predicted targets association. RESULTS: OGD induced injury in
 PC-12 cells by suppressing cell viability and inducing apoptosis. OGD also
 induced the expression of miR-424 in PC-12 cells. Overexpression of miR-424
 protected PC-12 cells from OGD-induced injury by increasing cell viability
 and decreasing apoptosis. MKP-1 was a direct target of miR-424, and its
 expression was negatively regulated by miR-424. Up-regulation of expression
 of MKP-1 aggravated OGD-induced cell injury by inhibiting the expression of
 hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), thus inhibiting the
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. CONCLUSIONS: miR-424 protected PC-12 cells from
 OGD-induced injury through direct suppression of MKP-1 expression, as MKP-1
 promoted OGD-induced cell injury by inhibiting the expression of HIF-1alpha
 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways.",
