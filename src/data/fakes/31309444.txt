    abstract "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) play
 important roles in the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury (SCI). This study
 investigated the effects of lncRNA Mirt2 and miR-429 on lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS)-induced injuries in PC12 cells. Serum samples were collected from 36
 patients with SCI and the healthy controls. The expression of lncRNA Mirt2 in
 serum samples was measured by qRT-PCR. The in vitro model of SCI was
 established by treating PC12 cells with LPS. The effects of lncRNA Mirt2 and
 miR-429 on the cell model were evaluated by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry,
 western blot, qRT-PCR, and ELISA. Further, the activation of NF-kappaB and
 p38MAPK pathways was tested by western blot. LPS induced obvious cell
 injuries in PC12 cells, as cell viability was reduced, apoptosis rate was
 increased, caspase-3 and -9 were cleaved, and the release of TNF-alpha and
 IL-6 was induced. lncRNA Mirt2 was up-regulated in LPS-stimulated PC12 cells
 and serum samples derived from SCI patients. Overexpression of lncRNA Mirt2
 protected PC12 cells against LPS-induced injuries. Further studies found that
 lncRNA Mirt2 acted as the molecular sponge of miR-429 and miR-34a-5p. lncRNA
 Mirt2 did not protect PC12 cells when miR-429 was overexpressed. Moreover,
 the inhibitory effects of lncRNA Mirt2 on NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways were
 abolished when miR-429 was overexpressed. lncRNA Mirt2 exerts protective
 effects in an in vitro model of SCI by down-regulating miR-429. This study
 shed light on the treatment of SCI by using the lncRNA-miRNA regulation
 network.",
