    abstract "Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays can cause damage of
 the skin and may induce cancer, immunosuppression, photoaging, and
 inflammation. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOX antisense intergenic RNA
 (HOTAIR) is involved in multiple human biological processes. However, its
 role in UVB-induced keratinocyte injury is unclear. This study was performed
 to investigate the effects of HOTAIR in UVB-induced apoptosis and
 inflammatory injury in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). Quantitative
 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze the expression
 levels of HOTAIR, PKR, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. Cell viability was measured using
 trypan blue exclusion method and cell apoptosis using flow cytometry and
 western blot. ELISA was used to measure the concentrations of TNF-alpha and
 IL-6. Western blot was used to measure the expression of PKR,
 apoptosis-related proteins, and PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathway proteins. UVB
 induced HaCaT cell injury by inhibiting cell viability and promoting cell
 apoptosis and expressions of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. UVB also promoted the
 expression of HOTAIR. HOTAIR suppression increased cell viability and
 decreased apoptosis and expression of inflammatory factors in UVB-treated
 cells. HOTAIR also promoted the expression of PKR. Overexpression of HOTAIR
 decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis and expression of
 inflammatory factors in UVB-treated cells by upregulating PKR. Overexpression
 of PKR decreased cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis in UVB-treated
 cells. Overexpression of PKR activated PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways. Our
 findings identified an essential role of HOTAIR in promoting UVB-induced
 apoptosis and inflammatory injury by up-regulating PKR in keratinocytes.",
