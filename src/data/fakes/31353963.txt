    abstract "Background: Angelica polysaccharide (AP) is disengaged from the
 roots of Angelica sinensis. The extensive pathological activities of AP have
 been discovered in disparate diseases. Nevertheless, the impression of AP in
 epilepsy (EP) remains unaware. The research attempted to probe the impact of
 AP on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked inflammatory injury in HT22 cells.
 Methods: AP were exploited to stimulate HT22 cells, cell cytotoxicity was
 monitored by CCK-8 assay. LPS was utilized to administrate HT22 cells to
 evoke inflammatory injury, meanwhile the involvements of AP in cell
 proliferation, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines productions were
 examined. MicroRNA-10a (miR-10a) inhibitor and its negative control were one
 by one transfected into HT22 cells, the effect of miR-10a inhibition on LPS-
 and AP-treated cells was determined. NF-kappaB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways were
 ultimately detected. Results: AP promoted cell proliferation, inhibited
 apoptosis and suppressed IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 productions in
 LPS-stimulated HT22 cells. Additionally, AP raised miR-10a expression in HT22
 cells administration with LPS. These functions of AP in LPS-disposed cells
 were conversed by miR-10a suppression. Further, AP interdicted NF-kappaB and
 JAK2/STAT3 pathways via enhancing miR-10a. Conclusions: Data corroboarted
 that AP mitigated LPS-evoked inflammatory injury through repression of
 NF-kappaB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways by regulating miR-10a in HT22 cells.",
