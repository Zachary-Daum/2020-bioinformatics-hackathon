    abstract "Baicalin is a flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis
 Georgi, with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities. The objective
 of this study was to explore the effect and mechanism of baicalin on
 chondrocyte inflammatory response in OA. Different concentrations of IL-1beta
 (0, 0.1, 2, 5 and 10ng/mL) were used to simulate inflammatory injury in
 CHON-001 cells. The expression of miR-126 was altered by transfection with
 miR-126 mimic. Thereafter, cells were treated with baicalin, and cell
 viability, apoptosis, the expressions of apoptosis-related protein and
 pro-inflammatory factors were respectively detected using CCK-8 assay, flow
 cytometry, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. We found that IL-1beta induced
 a significantly inflammatory injury in CHON-001 cells. Baicalin alleviated
 IL-1beta-induced inflammatory injury, as it increased cell viability,
 decreased cell apoptosis and repressed the production of IL-6, IL-8 and
 TNF-alpha. miR-126 was up-regulated by IL-1beta treatment while was
 down-regulated by baicalin. More interestingly, the protective actions of
 baicalin on IL-1beta-injured CHON-001 cells were partially eliminated by
 miR-126 overexpression. Further, NF-kappaB signaling pathway was activated by
 IL-1beta, and deactivated by addition of baicalin. The deactivation of
 NF-kappaB signaling pathway induced by baicalin upon IL-1beta exposure was
 recovered by miR-126 overexpression. In conclusion, this study demonstrated
 that baicalin protected CHON-001 cells against IL-1beta-induced inflammatory
 injury possibly via down-regulation of miR-126 and thereby deactivation of
 NF-kappaB signaling pathway.",
