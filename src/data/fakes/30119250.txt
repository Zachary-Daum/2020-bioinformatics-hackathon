    abstract "BACKGROUND: miR-208 family members have been considered as
 promising biomarkers in myocardial infarction (MI). Among which, miR-208a and
 miR-499 are reported to function as ischemic injury promoting miRNAs. This
 study aimed to explore the in vitro function of miR-208b in MI, which has not
 been widely studied. METHODS: RT-qPCR was conducted to measure the expression
 changes of miR-208b in MI patients, MI mouse model and H9c2 cells stimulated
 by hypoxia. H9c2 cells were subjected to hypoxia before which miR-208b
 expression was altered by transfection. CCK-8, flow cytometry and Western
 blot were performed to detect cell survival. Besides, the regulatory
 relationship between miR-208b, Bax, and PI3K/AKT was tested by luciferase
 reporter, RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Serum levels of miR-208b in MI
 patients were significantly higher than those in the healthy controls. Also,
 miR-208b was up-regulated in mouse model and cell model of MI. Overexpression
 of miR-208b protected H9c2 cells against hypoxia-induced apoptosis, as the
 viability was increased, apoptosis rate was decreased, Bax and Cytochrome c
 were down-regulated, and Bcl-2 was up-regulated. Bax was a target gene of
 miR-208b. And miR-208b could not protect H9c2 cells when Bax was
 overexpressed. More interestingly, miR-208b activated PI3K/AKT pathway via
 targeting Bax, and the activated PI3K/AKT pathway could further repress Bax
 expression. Finally, blocking PI3K/AKT pathway by using LY294002 eliminated
 the myocardioprotective effects of miR-208b. CONCLUSION: miR-208b is highly
 expressed during MI, and miR-208b protects H9c2 cells against hypoxia-induced
 apoptosis. miR-208b exerts myocardioprotective effect via targeting Bax and
 activating PI3K/AKT pathway.",
