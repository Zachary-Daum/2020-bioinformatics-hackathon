    abstract "BACKGROUND: The in vivo protective role of gastrodin (GSTD) in
 myocardial infarction (MI) has been reported. However, the underlying
 mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to explore the effects of GSTD on
 hypoxia-injured H9c2 cells as well as the downstream microRNAs (miRNAs) and
 signaling cascades. METHODS: Hypoxic injury model was constructed to mimic
 MI. Effects of GSTD pretreatment on cell proliferation and apoptosis were
 measured by CCK-8 assay, Western blot analysis, and flow cytometry/Western
 blot analysis, respectively. Expression of miR-21 in cells treated with
 hypoxia or hypoxia plus GSTD was determined by stem-loop RT-PCR. Whether GSTD
 affected hypoxia-injured cells via miR-21 was subsequently verified. The
 direct target of miR-21 was studied by bio-informatics ways and luciferase
 reporter assay. Besides, expression levels of key kinases in the
 PTEN/PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways were testified by Western blot analysis.
 RESULTS: Hypoxia-induced decrease of cell viability, up-regulation of p53 and
 p16, increase of apoptotic cells and up-regulation of Bax, cleaved casapse-3
 and cleaved caspase-9 were all mitigated by GSTD pretreatment. Expression of
 miR-21 was up-regulated by hypoxia and was further up-regulated by GSTD
 treatment. In transfected H9c2 cells, effects of GSTD on hypoxia-treated
 cells were augmented by miR-21 overexpression while were reversed by miR-21
 inhibition. PDCD4 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-21, and reversed
 the effect of miR-21 on hypoxia-injured cells. Finally, GSTD down-regulated
 PTEN expression and enhanced phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, p65 and
 IkappaBalpha via up-regulating miR-21. CONCLUSION: GSTD attenuated hypoxic
 injury of H9c2 cells through activating PTEN/PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways
 via up-regulating miR-21.",
