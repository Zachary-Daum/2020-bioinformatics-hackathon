    abstract "This study aimed to investigate the effects and possible
 mechanisms of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Sox2 overlapping transcript
 (Sox2ot) on hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 )-induced injury in pheochromocytoma
 (PC-12) cells. PC-12 cells were treated with H2 O2 to cell injury. The cells
 were transfected with short-hairpin RNA directed against Sox2ot (sh-Sox2ot),
 small interfering RNA directed against myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1)
 isoform2 (si-MCL-1), a miR-211 mimic, a miR-211 inhibitor, and their negative
 controls. Under different transfected treatments, cell viability, migration,
 invasion, and apoptosis as well as the expressions of apoptosis- and
 autophagy-related proteins were investigated. Besides, the regulatory
 relationships between Sox2ot and miR-211, miR-211 and MCL-1, as well as
 between MCL-1 and the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of the
 rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway
 were explored. Suppression of Sox2ot inhibited H2 O2 -induced PC-12 cell
 injury by increasing cell viability, migration, invasion, and decreasing
 apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, suppression of Sox2ot increased miR-211
 expression and alleviated H2 O2 -induced injury in PC-12 cells possibly via
 upregulation of miR-211. Furthermore, MCL-1 isoform2 was identified as a
 direct target of miR-211 and could be negatively regulated by miR-211.
 Suppression of miR-211 aggravated H2 O2 -induced cell injury by regulation of
 MCL-1 isoform2. Besides, inhibition of miR-211 suppressed the activation of
 the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in H2 O2 -treated PC-12 cells, which
 was reversed after knockdown of MCL-1 isoform2 at the same time. Our findings
 indicate that downregulation of Sox2ot may protect PC-12 cells from H2 O2
 -induced injury in SCI via targeting the miR-211/MCL-1 isoform2 axis. MCL-1
 isoform2 may further regulate the activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway
 to mediate H2 O2 -induced injury. The Sox2ot-miR-211-MCL-1 isoform2 axis may
 be a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI.",
