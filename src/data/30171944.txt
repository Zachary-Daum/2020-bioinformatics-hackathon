    abstract "PURPOSE: This study investigated the effects of propofol on
 gastric cancer MKN45 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis,
 as well as underlying potential mechanisms. METHODS: The viability,
 proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of MKN45 cells were assessed
 using CCK-8 assay, BrdU incorporation assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining,
 two-chamber migration (invasion) assay and western blotting, respectively.
 qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression of microRNA-195 (miR-195).
 Cell transfection was conducted to down-regulate the expression of miR-195.
 RESULTS: Propofol treatment suppressed MKN45 cell proliferation, migration
 and invasion, but promoted cell apoptosis. The expression of miR-195 was
 increased after propofol treatment. Suppression of miR-195 reversed the
 propofol-induced MKN45 cell proliferation, migration and invasion inhibition,
 as well as apoptosis. Moreover, Propofol treatment inactivated JAK/STAT and
 NF-kappaB pathways in MKN45 cells. Suppression of miR-195 reversed the
 propofol-induced inactivation of JAK/STAT and NF-kappaB pathways. Inhibition
 of JAK/STAT and NF-kappaB pathways reversed the effects of miR-195
 suppression on propofol-induced MKN 45 cell proliferation, migration and
 invasion inhibition, as well as apoptosis enhancement. CONCLUSION: Propofol
 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer MKN45 cells
 by up-regulating miR-195 and then inactivating JAK/STAT and NF-kappaB
 pathways. Propofol could be as an effective therapeutic medicine for gastric
 cancer treatment.",
