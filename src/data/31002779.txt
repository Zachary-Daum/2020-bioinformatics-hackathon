    abstract "Cerebral ischemia is the second leading cause of death and
 disability worldwide. Despite the neuroprotective role of Tanshinone IIA has
 been widely reported, the molecular mechanisms involving miRNAs remains
 unclear. We aimed to figure out a novel regulatory mechanism of Tanshinone
 IIA associated with miRNAs. Rat pheochomocytoma PC-12cells were exposed to
 hypoxia, followed by assays of cell viability and apoptosis using trypan blue
 exclusion and flow cytometry assay, respectively. Expression of proteins
 associated with apoptosis was measured by Western blot analysis. Effects of
 Tanshinone IIA on cell viability, apoptosis and expression of miR-28 were
 determined. Then, whether Tanshinone IIA functioned though miR-28 was
 analyzed. Finally, we explored the relationship between survivin and miR-28,
 and whether Tanshinone IIA activated the specificity protein 1 (Sp1)/survivin
 pathway though modulating miR-28. Hypoxia decreased cell viability and
 increased cell apoptosis though mitochondrial- and caspase-dependent
 pathways. Tanshinone IIA treatment prevented hypoxia-induced cell injury
 though preventing up-regulation of miR-28. Subsequently, we found survivin
 expression was down-regulated by miR-28 overexpression. In addition,
 expression of Sp1 and survivin was down-regulated by hypoxia, and the
 down-regulations were attenuated by Tanshinone IIA though miR-28. We
 confirmed that Tanshinone IIA prevented hypoxia-induced PC-12cell injury
 though preventing the up-regulation of miR-28, along with activation of the
 Sp1/survivin pathway in PC-12cells under hypoxia.",
