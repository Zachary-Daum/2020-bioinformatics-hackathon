    abstract "BACKGROUND: Finding novel agent for cerebral ischemia therapy is
 urgently required. In our present study, we aimed to investigate the
 regulatory mechanism of Ginkgolides B (GB) in hypoxia-injured PC-12 cells.
 METHODS: PC-12 cells were exposed to hypoxia and administrated with GB. Cell
 viability was detected by MTT assay. Flow cytometry assay was conducted for
 the detection of cell apoptosis, ROS generation and cell cycle assay. The
 changes of protein levels of Bax, Pro/Cleaved-Caspase-3, CyclinD1, CDK4,
 CDK6, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways were detected by Western blot.
 Transfection was conducted for Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) knockdown. RESULTS:
 Hypoxia-induced decrease of cell viability and increase of ROS generation,
 apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were ameliorated by GB. Hypoxia disposition
 hindered PI3 K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways while GB had the opposite
 effects. Then we observed that hypoxia exposure suppressed PLK1 expression
 while GB increased PLK1 expression dose-dependently. Knockdown of PLK1
 attenuated the neuroprotective effects of GB on hypoxia-injured PC-12 cells
 and also inhibited PI3 K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways. CONCLUSION: The above
 observations corroborated that GB alleviated hypoxia-induced PC-12 cell
 injury by up-regulation of PLK1 via activating PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways.
 These findings implied the neuro-protective impacts in hypoxia-injured PC-12
 cells.",
