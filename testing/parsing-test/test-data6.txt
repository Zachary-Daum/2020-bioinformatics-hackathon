    abstract "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA), as a degenerative disease, is a
 major problem in ageing populations. To better understand the underlying
 mechanisms in the pathogenesis of OA, this study was undertaken to
 investigate the role of microRNA (miR)-19a in chondrocytes. METHODS:
 Expression of the members of miR-17-92 cluster in synovium from OA patients
 and non-OA patients were measured by quantitative reverse
 transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). miR-19a was abnormal
 expressed in human chondrocyte line (CHON-001 and T-C/28 cells) and primary
 human chondrocytes by transient transfection. Cell viability, migration and
 apoptosis were determined by CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay, and flow
 cytometry, respectively. Expression of apoptosis related factors was measured
 by western blot. Transcription factor SOX9 expression and activity of
 NF-kappaB pathway were also assessed by western blot. RESULTS: Levels of
 miR-19a and other five members of miR-17-92 cluster were down-regulated in OA
 patients' synovium compare with non-OA. miR-19a overexpression promoted cell
 viability and migration of chondrocytes, while miR-19a suppression promoted
 cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell viability and migration. miR-19a direct
 up-regulated expression of SOX9, and thus affecting cell viability and
 migration. miR-19a promoted activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway to
 up-regulate SOX9 expression. CONCLUSION: miR-19a was down-regulated in
 synovium form OA patients. miR-19a could promote cell viability and migration
 of chondrocyte via positively regulating SOX9 expression through NF-kappaB
 signaling pathway. This study might provide the novel strategy for clinical
 treatment of OA caused by chondrocyte function degradation.",
