    abstract "We aimed to investigate the effect and mechanisms of tanshinone
 (TSN) IIA in cerebral infarction. The cerebral infarction rat model was
 established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). After pretreatment
 with TSN, cerebral infarct volume, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits
 score were evaluated, as well as cell apoptosis in hippocampus and cortex of
 the brain was examined with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick
 end labeling (TUNEL) and the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis
 factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined by
 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In addition, rat primary neuronal
 cells were isolated and cultured in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)
 conditions. After pretreatment with TSN, cell viability and apoptosis were
 observed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
 (MTT) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The expressions of Bax
 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were detected by quantitative reverse
 transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting.
 Compared with untreated cerebral infarction rat, TSN treatment significantly
 reduced cerebral infarct volume, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits
 score ( P < 0.05). Cell apoptosis as well as the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha,
 and CRP in hippocampus and cortex of cerebral infarction rat were inhibited
 after pretreatment with TSN ( P < 0.05). Furthermore, TSN remarkably
 increased cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis ratio ( P < 0.05) in
 OGD-induced rat neuronal cells. Besides, TSN significantly downregulated the
 expression of Bax and upregulated Bcl-2 ( P < 0.05). TSN IIA has a preventive
 effect on cerebral infarction by inhibiting neuronal cell apoptosis and
 inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo.",
